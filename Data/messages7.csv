either coming out as trans finally or suicide,2680646,fly,"Sep 23, 2024 at 6:03 PM","Hi,
I just can't feel comfortable in my body, which is read as very masculine. It just hurts a lot. I only know this pain from my depression, but I've never had this dysphoria so strongly and for so long. I don't know if I'll manage to come out in time so that hormone therapy etc. will work. I don't think that will lead me to the only solution. Suicide. Not acutely, maybe not soon, but I know that there are only two ways for me to somehow feel better in the long term.
Srry for the long text, I'm really sorry, but I love you all and would be very happy about answers, yes, actually
Best regards

either coming out as trans finally or suicide,2680805,imsotired35,"Sep 23, 2024 at 8:15 PM","I hope you find a way to be comfortable in your body, however that may be. There are many many trans people who transition later in life and still find happiness with their new selves, maybe you could look up some videos or blogs of peoples experiences with transitioning later on? Out of curiosity how old are you? I don't know much about hormone therapy but I believe it still has affect even if you are post pubescent which I presume you are. Also you don't have to come out publicly in order to see a doctor and talk to them about your options. You can talk to them first, start hormones and give yourself more time to be ready.",,,,,,,,,,

either coming out as trans finally or suicide,2680879,Just_Another_Person,"Sep 23, 2024 at 9:26 PM","It is never too late too to start HRT. Not gonna lie, after puberty ""MTF HRT"" isn't so effective but it still can make wonders to your body. It is like a lottery, sometimes you get lucky and other times not so lucky, so it is possible you get good results.

About coming out, it is a hard decision. I don't know about your home/country situation about the topic, but maybe you get accepted?

Fantasizing about after my death,2671762,willitpass,"Sep 16, 2024 at 9:35 AM","All I can think about anymore is CTB is a couple of weeks. I've worn my thoughts thin thinking about it over and over again all day every day. I can only play over the act itself so many times before I'm thinking the same thing in circles, so my mind has drifted to the after. I know it doesn't matter. I'll be dead. But my mind is looking for anything to think about related to my CTB.

I hope the hotel worker doesnt see much at all before calling first responders. I should have a large trash bag over my head so long as I dont pull it off while unconscious, so that will spare them the sight of my face. My body will be under blankets. I can only imagine how disturbing it would be to see someone laying in bed with a bag over their head, but at least they won't have the memory of my dead face engrained into them.

I hate that it will have to be treated like a crime scene. Everything collected as evidence. Photos taken of my body. An autopsy performed. I understand why they can't, but I wish they could take obvious suicides at face value and just give all of my belongings to my family and allow me to go straight to the crematorium. An investigation will only cause my family more pain.

I've been listening to music about death. Not about suicide, but about
death and loss. Looking through baby pictures of myself and wondering what the exact point was that I lost my innocence. It wasn't long at all. 5 or 6 at the latest.",,,,,,,,,,

I will have my journals from my entire life intentionally open to the most telling page open next to my body along with my photo album. My favorite family photo from when I was a baby pulled out and set on top. My current journal open to the newest page with my thoughts written out in real time up until I become ready to pass out and put the bag over my head.

Fantasizing about after my death,2672501,willitpass,"Sep 16, 2024 at 10:32 PM","It will be incredibly clear by the scene that it's suicide. Years of journal entries talking about being depressed and suicidal dating back to when I was 9. My current journal has pages from what will be about a month prior to my death where I talk in detail about what I plan on doing down to the medications and dosages I will be taking. I grew up in the mental healthcare system. I have 3 attempts that nearly killed me that are in my medical record. No one will truly question it being a suicide. Unfortunately it's law where I live that they will have to investigate, including doing an autopsy and temporarily holding anything on scene as evidence. I hope that they will return my belongings back to my family as soon as they finish their open and shut investigation. No will or advanced directive can stop a crime scene investigation.",2672485,,,,,,,,,

I read accounts of final exit supposedly holding hands down but I thought the beauty of this method is that your body does not recognize it is dying so does not make any attempts to save itself.

Fantasizing about after my death,2680790,willitpass,"Sep 23, 2024 at 8:03 PM","It is very common, especially if the bag is not the appropriate size and the person is not using sedatives. Your body will start to have elevated levels of CO2 from rebreathing, and if this occurs prior to oxygen levels dropping sufficiently, panic signals will be sent off. Once your brain starts panicking, it will do anything and everything to save you. In this case, saving you involves taking off the bag preventing you from getting adequate oxygen. It has very questionable success rates, and is nearly impossible without drugs on board unless you manage to perfectly calculate the bag size. In my case it's a backup in case my main method fails, not the primary method, which is why I'm not thinking too hard about it. I won't be placing it until I feel I'm nearing unconscious from the overdosing and sedatives, so no risk of me taking it off while awake and I pray I'll be so heavily sedated I won't take it off while unconscious either.",2680781,,,,,,,,,

I feel like I don't have good enough reasons, or ENOUGH reasons, for that matter. The fact that sometimes, I actually feel like living, makes me think that my reasons are absolute horseshit.

Only you can decide if your reasons are good enough to warrant catching the bus. Because it is your decision alone.
I don't want to turn this into a TED talk by accident, so I'll answer your question. I don't feel like my reasons for considering suicide are very good, but then again, I have low self esteem. At the same time, the fact I personally feel like my reasons aren't good enough is what's keeping me going in life. For me, life has its ups and downs, and when one day I feel like my reasons for dying are good enough for me, I will CTB. Part of me hopes it's soon but another part of me still wants to give a shot at this game of life until something gives.

There are some bad reasons like getting stuck in a moment and acting impulsively being one of them. But imho, if you're wondering if the reasons are good enough, then they may not be. It's not a comparison of suffering or an arbitrary threshold everyone must reach. It's different for different people. But we should exhaust possibilities before thinking of ctb. Like seeking help, trying to change our circumstances, seeing if we can reduce our suffering enough to feel life is worth living.

I could choose to CTB over getting the wrong McDonald's order and it would be no less valid than if I were married for 30 years and my wife decided to cheat on me, burn down my home for insurance money, cash the check, and run off to another country.

I do believe in getting your affairs in order and practicing common decency though and making sure those who have to brunt the foot of the bill be repaid in full and possibly be compensated extra for their applied effort.

I mean, the reality is that we are us. The world that we perceive is entirely through our own senses. In other words, the world really does revolve around us, (not trying to sound oberly prideful). If we choose to leave this world, those 5 physical senses are gone for good, and most people in the world have different opinions on what comes next.

We'd be giving up a lot of human experiences, so yes, personally I feel like there should be an extremely valid reason to want to give all that up. As well, a new reason to keep living can just pop pop out of nowhere (it just happened to me recently).

Honestly, no. The first time I had suicidal thoughts, I was 10 and they frightened me. I felt like it was wrong to have them. But, after having them a few more times, I just felt like- right or wrong, they're here. And anyway- who gets to judge whether they are right or wrong or even justified? It's really what other people believe- 'suicides go to hell, suicide is the cowards way out' etc. etc. But- those aren't actually my opinions. They are what other people have pushed on me. Plus, I felt like life was particularly bad at that point. Ironically, in many ways, it's better now for me.

Where I do agree is- are my motives for wanting to go enough for the possible (likely) hurt my suicide could cause? At the moment- no- they're not- which is largely why I'm still here. If my situation deteriorated though or- if the last remaining person I believe my suicide would deeply affect died (my Dad,) then the balance would change and I'd feel more justified in going.",,,,,,,,,,

I think one's decision to ctb is always valid - the fact the person has litterally had to overcome the very nature of being which without considering ego or personality which has literally built in it without our consideration or conscious consideration the continuation of being to 'insist' as well as 'exist' is the very nature of being - this on its own is what makes the decision so difficult even without the consideration of others and ourselves.

The fact one can't have these discussions without the full weight of 'survivalist' insistence coming down upon them is a tragedy in itself - we are held hostage and forced to find 'reasons' by internalised guilt from pro-life messaging but like so much of the meaningful stuff of life silence and suppression always accompanies honest, authentic and meaningful discussion having been stifled and drowned out by agendas, worldviews and others unexamined vested interests.",2680660,,,,,,,,,

How do non-suicidal people feel?,2670878,Eideprius,"Sep 15, 2024 at 1:01 PM","As a child, I had a time when I really wanted to die. I felt terrible, cried all night and thought about suicide the whole time. I never tried, and after my parents found out, I get better. But not good. I've never felt great.
I can't remember the feelings I had before this time. I know I was often stressed and anxious as a young child, but maybe I still felt happy.

The thing is, I don't know how i should feel. At what point I can't expect more.
I can't remember many moments in the last few years.
I only remember one moment in my entire life when I was happy. Where I felt like this moment makes life good. And I was at least happy enough to remember it. When I'm otherwise happy, it's more of a break from unhappiness and my own thoughts.
Maybe I also just forgot all the happy feelings in my past.

And I wonder why and how other people feel like they want to live. I have felt terrible in the past and would say I am feeling better and calmer now, but I still think about ending my life. Moments like this where I don't feel that deep emotional pain are rare, but still not enough to move on. More like I'm in peace with dying. And I'm afraid that this is maybe all I can feel. That I expect more, but there is no more.
Do other people feel something that I don't? Or is what everyone feels just not enough for me to live?
I really don't know what I have done wrong in life, that I have ended up like this.",,,,,,,,,,

But that is just a short mask of my true feelings. Enough to make it through the days, but not enough to feel happy. There have been periods of my life where I genuinely felt okay most of the time. Ocasional periods where I felt true happiness. But they are few and far between and always interrupted by a depressive period. And when I have these periods it is always still in the back of my mind that death would be preferable. That suicide will still be my end. That the depression will always come back. Mental illness is a thief. I will never know what it is like to experience happiness without a shadow of suicide hanging over me. I don't remember what it felt like before I became sick as a child either.",,,,,,,,,,
How do non-suicidal people feel?,2670919,Forever Sleep,"Sep 15, 2024 at 1:35 PM","I'm similar to you in that I began having suicidal thoughts early on in life- aged 10. I don't think it did occur to me prior to that that I wanted to be dead. I wasn't always happy as such but it wasn't as bad as wanting it all to be over. Still- it feels kind of pointless trying to work out how I felt as a young child because- even if I turned out as a non suicidal adult, I doubt we think like we do when we're children. There are usually fewer responsibilities and maybe we just live in the moment. All I can really remember is being obsessed with play- like most children I suppose.

I suppose it does make it harder though when someone wants to give 'recovery' a real shot. Like- what is it we should even be aiming for? I know what you mean.",,,,,,,,,,

Now, I have so wicked insomnia (basically have barely slept at all for 2.5 years) which is causing all kinds of other health problems.

One little mistake, took my eyes off the ball for a few seconds, and boom. It can happen in a heartbeat. The mortal life is so fragile, and then a bit of bad luck and it's basically game over.

How do non-suicidal people feel?,2680794,vitbar,"Sep 23, 2024 at 8:05 PM","My depression has always been episodic. So I've kept knowing what it's like without the depression.

For me it's not even that I'm happy and having a continuous wonderful time. Most of it I'm just living, but without that horrible weight, and without thinking about it, or its absence, at all. I do still have sad times and happy ones, but I can have them without the thoughts and feelings in the background.

It's weird how when depressed I struggle to remember feeling different. What I can remember seems unreal or like it happened to someone else. When I'm not depressed I don't think about the depression, and struggle to explain it in any detail. When the episodes settle over me it all comes flooding back. It's so familiar. Often don't realise they've started or stopped untill a few days in or out.

Since finding a medication combination that works for me I feel okay or good most of the time. They haven't completely got rid of the episodes. What remains of them is milder. The ideation is still present. I think it is an ingrained part of my personality now.",,,,,,,,,,

I felt okay for the first two seconds after it happened. Then my mom got mad and said that that dude could've had a gun. And if I'd did I again I couldn't be in the car with her.

She wants what's best for me I guess. But that involves me being a docile weakling like her. I'd rather be a wolf amongst sheep than a sheep amongst wolves.

Flipping off the driver of another car is pretty deep in ""aggressive"" and is the type of thing that could actually trigger an impulsive double homicide on the part of the other driver.

Buying N in Peru - Personal experience (August 2024),2616062,Isbel88,"Jul 31, 2024 at 10:19 PM","I am a native of Peru and I live here. But I must say that even for natives it is difficult to get N these days.
There are two veterinary pharmacy chains in Lima. However, one of them requires the PHYSICAL PRESENCE of the veterinarian to sell N. This makes it impossible to acquire N. There is the other company. I do not want to specify names or give addresses or exact data so that the method is not lost. The other chain of veterinary pharmacies does sell N with the sole presentation of a medical prescription. In my case I was able to get a fake medical prescription with a stamp.

In Arequipa it is also possible to get N. I traveled to that city and I must say that there is less control. It is available in agro-veterinary stores, those in the Arequipa area do not ask for so many requirements.

Do you believe that suicide means going to heaven or hell?,2680658,Praying 4 a Miracle,"Sep 23, 2024 at 6:13 PM","According to the bible, and most biblical scholars, committing suicide does NOT mean going to hell, heaven is still a very real possibility. It's definitely considered to be a sin, but it is a forgivable sin.

Whether we go to heaven or hell has far more to do with believing in, and having a relationship with God. The only unforgivable sin is blasphemy of the Holy Spirit.

Personally, I am a Christian and do believe in God, however, because there are so many variations and different denominations in Christianity (there are literally thousands), I'm an open-minded and non-judgemental Christian. I mean in my country of Canada, there is literally a different type of church on every corner.

I also don't judge people for having a completely different belief system altogether. It's not our job to judge others, because we're not God.

Whether we believe in a spiritual afterlife or not, there is no reason to believe that suicide automatically means we're going to hell. According to the bible, the much bigger issue is believing in him, and having a relationship with him.

What is NOT clearly stated in the bible, is what heaven is exactly. It may be a physical place, or it may be a spiritual realm. Some believe we get our physical body back, but in perfect condition, with no chance of disease, sickness, or any other problem. A new (your) younger body, (early 20's) for all of eternity, never growing old. There is also mention of streets of gold.

Other denominations believe that heaven and hell are spiritual realms, with no physics involved whatsoever. This would mean that time does not exist, since time is the King of all physical properties. Other religions of the world believe in reincarnation, Atheists believe there is absolutely nothing after we die, it's simply lights out. Agnostics aren't sure one way or the other.

For those of us who DO believe in God and heaven, one thing is for sure, and that is it's going to be unbelievably amazing. God knows if you are suffering, he knows why, and he does not want us to suffer for years on end. He gave us our life, and it is precious, so we shouldn't destroy it needlessly.

Myself, I am also suffering, and having thoughts of suicide. I'm also praying for a miracle, and doing my best to love, honor, repent for my sins, and have a relationship with him. I often wonder why he's allowing us to suffer like this.

According to the experts, he allows it so that we can grow spiritually. Not much personal growth and character will build if everything is going just great in our lives all of the time. Constant suffering for years and years with no end in sight, we all know is really hard to deal with, and maybe that is why he's saying that suicide is not an unforgivable sin.",,,,,,,,,,

i think you sorta covered some of this in your post that the bible does not explicitly define a heaven or hell. I think people just see that shown in the movies the depiction of hell with rivers of fire and heaven with the pearly gates and clouds and just believe what they see in the movies as they get most of their beliefs from the media , movies ,Tv etc. that is most people believe that the Christian Bible / religion depict heaven or hell because that is what repeatedly shown in the movies .




Hell, as a lake of fire for eternal punishment, does NOT exist in the Bible! — Paul McLellan
The concept of “hell”, as a lake of fire set aside for eternal torment simply is not found anywhere in the Bible. Here is proof that it does not exist but instead of a gross misinterpretation from “Sheol”, “Hades”, “Tartarus” and “Gehenna”!

I just think a human is an animal , cells, a brain in a box called a skull so there is no afterlife , there is no hell .

I think A human is just neural networks shaped into patterns in the brain to create models of the world and the self. There is nothing there just the software enscribed in the patterns of the neural networks similar to an ai , fly , mouse that also have neural networks .

How Neural Networks Can Think Like Humans And Why It Matters
Some neural networks are now more similar to human cognition than ever before, according to a study published in Nature.

But it does reduce anxiety when I have an anxiety attack, so when you take SN and would have freaked out without benzos, then benzos would be effective.

Took 7mg of Clonazepam(Benzo) for my SN prep as an experiment,2680050,phoebie467,"Sep 23, 2024 at 10:38 AM","That's my experience with benzos:

I tested my clonazepam, 2 mg had no effect, I only got a bit sleepy the next day, but the sedative effect was very weak. Next night, I tested 4 mg and again I didn't feel any effect (within 1-2 hours of taking it). However, I woke up the next day feeling very sleepy and dizzy, It's like I've been awake all night. Oh, I woke up a few times during the night, so the sedative effect wasn't too powerful.

I also tested diazepam at low doses and the results were the same: a weak sedative effect and a little dizziness the next day.

Alprazolam was the only benzo that really made me sleepy (in low doses). 2 mg is enough to make you sleepy in 20 to 60 minutes, and 4 mg has a sedative effect so powerful that it seems impossible to interrupt your sleep. The next day, you may also feel a little dizzy and sleepy, but these effects are weaker and don't ruin your day.

I was frustrated because, in theory, alprazolam has a weaker sedative effect than these other two benzos. Its purpose is to treat anxiety, but in high doses, the sedative effect becomes very powerful.

I'm now starting to consider just using alprazolam in my SN protocol. 2 or 4mg at the beginning to reduce anxiety, and 30mg at the end to ensure unconsciousness.

The worst thing about alprazolam is that it tastes bad, very bad. If you crush it and mix it with water, it becomes even worse.

Oh, and I have no tolerance for benzo.

Is unattainable self-actualization a valid reason to ctb?,2680754,İnilerim,"Sep 23, 2024 at 7:28 PM","Think of a time in your life, a single point, where you were at your peak. You had things under control, you were following your passions, putting 100% of your attention into your talents, thrieving at being yourself. Think of what you could have attained if you managed to keep up this state of you for an extended period of time, maybe even a life time.

The only time I was ever close to it, ever even had a chance maintain some of it, was while I was living with my parents. I was one of those kids who never studied for school or did any homework and still got decent grades (major red flag right there). Once I moved out and started studying at university, my focus shifted to studies, which I poured all of myself into. That was rewarding as well, but not at the same kind of level. All I have to show for it are some above-average grades; I didn't even finish the degree. And now that I'm out of that cycle, my entire mind is just consumed with staying alive. Managing interpersonal relations as well as technical issues, while working at my first full time job, consumed so much of me that I had practically nothing else left (I have autistic traits, meaning everything that comes natural to neurotypicals, I have to painstakingly emulate).

I will never again learn, or get good at, or create things as I did back when I was sheltered, and it absolutely murders me inside. I have nothing else left that would give me purpose. Human connections are sweet, but fickle, and take incredible effort to maintain. Having a pet would be nice, but I'm nowhere near stable enough to justify taking care of another being at this point. I have zero interest in getting married or having children (actually leaning antinatalist). Excelling at the few niches I am good at, and being fully immersed in hobbies/interests, made life worth living enough that I went through 3 years of high school bullying with not a shred of suicidal thoughts (those came much later).

The last 10 years have been nothing but a slow ride towards complete stagnation. Most doors are closed by now. Imagining my future is mental torture.",,,,,,,,,,

Going forward, I aspire to show patients the kind of compassion that you have for people, although I likely won't be building patient-provider relationships the same way you did. I'm an ER tech and want to switch to EMS later on after I get my driver's license reinstated, because the qualifications for ER techs and EMTs are basically the same.

People were worried about me. I couldn't really put on a front. I was disassociated all day, staring off into space, not very engaged in conversation. I had people ask if I was okay.

I stayed for my father, because he's depressed and I'm scared he'd follow in my footsteps. Now I feel he hates me. I don't know what it is that is wrong with me at the moment, but the urge to kill myself without preparations is getting stronger each day. I thought I wanted a planned out suicide. Place, day, time. Everything. Now I just wanna jump off the roof without saying goodbye to anyone. This just feels pointless. Life scares me. Besides my parents, there is genuinely nothing I wish to go on for. My parents know about my thoughts which, in a way, reassures me. I was briefly sent to the hospital for it so if I decide to go through with it now, it won't be as surprising. Maybe not as painful. I'll try to hang on until my birthday, at least. It's this saturday. It's gonna be lonely, but at least I'm aware. Then, I don't know what I'll do.

Metoclopramide Protocol,2670243,theconductor25,"Sep 14, 2024 at 8:34 PM","After going through the forum, I'm wondering if Meto is really necessary for the SN method? Apparently, a lot of people who used Meto still vomited. Now, I would personally like to avoid using Meto because of the potential negative side effects it has. Instead, I plan on just using propranolol, paracetemol, benadryl (diphenhydramine), and the SN.

However, if I do end up using Meto, will I be able to avoid any side effects if I take it 40 minutes before the SN, instead of the 48 hour regimen?",,,,,,,,,,
Metoclopramide Protocol,2670351,cowboypants,"Sep 14, 2024 at 10:21 PM",Yeah 40 min is enough as PPH also says it. It's likely not effective as taking it for two days but good enough,,,,,,,,,,
Metoclopramide Protocol,2670374,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 14, 2024 at 11:01 PM","Meto isn't 100% necessary, but it's helpful in facilitating a successful attempt. it speeds up gastric emptying, which means the SN spends less time converting to nitric oxide in your stomach and more SN ends up in your gut. You also have a smaller window of time to vomit the SN out, since your stomach contents will empty into your intestines sooner than someone without Meto. it doesn't appear to help much with nausea though, as you've noticed. And you are correct that Meto can have some real nasty side effects, permanent ones like tardive dyskinesia.

If you're looking to avoid allowing too much time for these side effects to potentially arise, then a stat dose is more than adequate. according to stan's and vizzy's guide, the 48hr regimen isn't any more effective than the stat dose. and the pph advises a stat dose.",2670243,,,,,,,,,

I also wanna mention since the this line (""i just dont want to have the last time-peirod of my life to be boring, depressing and exhausting."") makes me think of when people on this site sometimes talk about they wanna have a good times before they go usually in the form of ""hookers and cocaine"" just quoting what some have said and it´s a fun thought to have and I think most of us have fantasized about if we know we would ctb in e.g. 6 months just take a loan or spend your savings on trips/vacations, hookers and cocaine in Las Vegas (was the post I remember) and I am sure many people have gone out that way but I would think it would be hard to ctb after pursuing so much hedonistic pleasure, just some thoughts on the matter.",2673393,,,,,,,,,

I know what you mean, currently I am in fact trying to do the things that is considered going in the right direction but it´s so hard, usually I get burned out pretty quickly so I have tried many times and failed it feels sometimes meaningless because yeah I feel a bit better when trying again but even worse when I fail for the hundred time and yet here I am trying to better myself again.

Anyways this is not a rant on your parents in particular the situation just made me think about it maybe because my parents have been with me through thick and thin and if I had a child which I never will but if I did I would imagine I´d love them as much as I love my parents and I can´t understand why some people parents can just cut off their bond over something so small, in your case it even sounds like you are actively doing something like you got an internship which not everyone gets so that must mean you are somewhat competent at least more than anyone else who applied and certainly way more than my disabled ass.


I do the same but I hope this time I will keep on track for once and I just try to focus on doing better each day even if it´s just folding some laundry or like yesterday I got my old PS2 plugged in so I am just focusing on the very small stuff atm compared to the big things other people have going on in life.",2675543,2675543,,,,,,,,

Already quit my job after saving up enough money to make it until then and severed ties with everyone but my parents at this point, quit my job I've had for over half a decade after saving up enough money to last the month, and written (most of) my final letters to be found on my person.

When I was still undecided about my desire to CTB I put effort in and tried my hardest to make things work with people I cared about but once that failed I kind of just said ""screw it"" and made my plans to end things after ordering my SN. I have about a week to go at most until my SN arrives then I'll be ready on the first week of October.

When I say I put a lot of effort into wanting to NOT end things I mean it. And after months of trial and constant error (usually not on my part) there just isn't anything tethering me to this existence anymore.

At this point my life is on maintenance mode until it's eventual shutdown and I couldn't be more content with that as my life is simpler than ever. I did have the desire for one last sexual romp but that doesn't seem like it's going to come to fruition so I'm okay with that.

I just can't fathom waiting 6 months knowing that I'm going to CTB anyways, I've waited nearly one month now since making my decision and it's felt like an eternity.

Maybe you don't really desire that path?",,,,,,,,,,

If so, then the reason why is because, well, it's in small amounts. Small amounts of SN isn't dangerous and it provides protection form the formation of C. botulism in cured meats. How dangerous something is depends on factors, such as dosage or what compound it is in. There is a massive different between consuming 15g of 99.9% pure SN versus consuming small amounts of it when eating cured meats. A lot of the nitrate and nitrate compounds are also broken down and converted into safer compounds, too.

Dry-cured bacon only has 200ppm or 0.02% SN in it. The LD50 for SN is 71mg/kg.

SN in Australia -YES YOU CAN GET IT IN 2024,2676855,DOHARDTHINGS24,"Sep 21, 2024 at 1:25 AM","Yes you can get SN in Australia from overseas in 2024.
You can, you can, you can.
WITHOUT welfare checks or border forces or any dramas whatsoever.
I am Australian. I ordered from DMC this year & received it. It sat at customs a long time but with hindsight, the docks were probably busy - I stacked panic attack on top of panic attack at the time though.
I emailed back & forth with B from Poland who also said they have zero problems delivering to Australia. As did the labs I spoke to.
I am writing this post for a specific reason that isn't up for debate.
I put Australia into the search bar here yesterday, I do this every now & then.
I saw a post from someone claiming they ordered SN into Australia & got stopped by border forces etc. Which may well be their experience & is none of my business.
BUT, their post made wild statements such as ""do not ship SN into Australia from anywhere!!!""
Which is bullshit.
And we're a country that excels at calling bullshit.
So I'm calling bullshit.
I'm actually quite mad about it TBH.
Anyone can recount their own experience, this is a bloody forum after all, but you don't get to extrapolate your experiences to be everybody's experiences. We shouldn't be spreading fear & outright ignorance. Or just fakery. I really hope it's just ignorance…
But the bottom line is, you can get it delivered to AU.
Fact, not opinion.
So I'll tell you what I have to offer & what I don't.
This is basically a public service announcement combined with a call to action.
I'm Australian, I ordered from DMC, this year, no dramas (except all the ones in my head). I have posted about it extensively on this forum, everything from anxiety to payment methods to testing. I've tried to pay it forward - all the lovely, beautiful help I've received here. It's been overwhelming & I'm grateful beyond words.
But, and again, there's a but - I won't be giving out the source to anyone at all for any reason. I'm also not particularly open to answering messages from new people here after recent experiences. Please respect that. No source, no answering.
If you search my posts, there's a bunch.
I am posting this because it makes me sick to the stomach that someone who really needs it could have a source or a method denied to them, at a time they really need it, just by believing some random stranger on the internet. I am aware that I am also a random stranger on the internet. I am also very aware that all my posts are pro-DMC but that is because that is who I used.
If anyone reads this, & I hope they do, please at the least, bump. And if you're Australian & received SN, please jump in & say if you had successful deliveries, I guess especially if not DMC, so it doesn't just look like a pro DMC thread. And if you know any Aussie's on here that have received, please reach out to them & ask them to post here as well. It can be as little as ""received July 2024"" or ""B from Poland"". Anything.
If I had joined SaSu in the last few weeks, I wouldn't have pursued SN & I don't have a backup plan & I cannot even begin to think what I would have done. Except been desperate & alone, instead of supported by a brilliant community. Please don't take options away from people that already don't have options - if we had options, most of us wouldn't be here.
I hope this thread jumps to the top of the pile, so that if someone searches Australia, they're going to feel less alone & anxious & more confident & find all the reassurance they need instead of lies or ignorance or propaganda or reporters or any of the shit that's been popping up lately.
Again, I'm just here to start the thread / convo. I won't give out my source. I won't answer new messages. Please respect that. Please use the search bar for me for anything Australia & DMC related. Other Australians or people that know Australians - please help the community in my country by adding POSITIVE, SUCCESS stories only. The border force stories are welcome to pile on to that thread, you're not required here & I do feel for you if any of that happened. But put that on the right thread, the negative thread, not this one. Thank you for respecting that too. I apologise for how very frustrated I sound, but I really am. I don't have the time or resources to be doing this, but it kept me up last night, & I knew I had to see something, say something.
Best of luck to you all.",,,,,,,,,,

They spoke to me and also called the ambulance to get the medics to see if I was ok! Not to mention having to explain myself to my father about was going on !
My second attempt was successful . It didn't even get delayed at customs. The difference was payment method . So maybe the guy who got his SN intercepted used a different payment than you?

For clarity though, you use the acronym N at the top & SN at the bottom.
Do you mean N & SN? Or SN for all?
I wouldn't have the balls to attempt obtaining N.
Payment methods could be a contributing factor, I have no idea. So for clarity, even though I've talked about it a bunch elsewhere, I used the Paysend app on an iPhone. It showed up on my bank statement as Paysend London.
I have no doubt there are horror stories to be had, & I legitimately feel for people that weren't as lucky as me. But the point of this thread, I guess, is to help people BE as lucky as me. We're the lucky country. We developed SN as a peaceful way to die for animals, we also stole it to be peaceful for humans.
So if there's anything you can add at all, that you're comfortable with, and please don't feel pressured to share anything that you're not but if you can - did you mean SN in all of the above? Can you share the successful payment method? The unsuccessful method? If both orders were from the same source? The same country? When the successful attempt was? For customs to intercept it - did the packaging indicate what was inside in any way? DMC lie, labs tend to have labs written on it, marketplaces just the name of the market (that sell a million other things). Or did they open it randomly? And if so, & it's not an illegal substance, what would trigger an out of hours police visit? Please don't feel that this is an interrogation in any way. I apologise that it may appear that way. I don't doubt your experience. I empathise with your experience. But if there's anything further that you can add to help other Australians, please do. And if you choose not to, I completely 100 percent respect that & appreciate what you have contributed. I only want people to share what they're comfortable sharing. Truly. We're an isolated country, this is an isolated community. We all need help. Any tiny little detail may be the difference between success & failure for someone else & while I don't encourage CTB'ing in general, I accept that some of us are here because we need to be. Best of luck to you, whether you choose to respond or not.
Thank you so much. Please, if you can, report back if or when you successfully receive. Mine took longer than quoted & sat at customs for a long time & then again at the local postal sorting place. I was an anxious wreck at every single delay so if yours takes longer than you thought, it may not mean anything at all, it may still be coming, just slower than you hoped. The docks too busy, Australia post too slow. Anything at all. I hope that's of some reassurance, but tbh, absolutely nothing would've reassured me until it was in my hand.

The fact is SN isn't an illegal substance (unlike certain kinds of drugs).

I agree with you - chances are pretty low, customs definitely do not check every parcel in depth, risk remains.
So what can we do to lower that risk?
Share our success stories as much as we can to improve other people's chances of success.
With discretion where needed.
As I said, I successfully received from DMC this year - it would be great if anyone else can share any tiny sliver of other successes - did anyone receive from Poland, from India? Or just say they successfully received from a different source to mine, even if they're uncomfortable sharing a name or country - just say ""I got in May, not from DMC"". Even that little could change how someone else's story plays out here. This support matters.
Oh wow! Good on you I guess. I'm too scared, even though it's the dream. I didn't use bitcoin but there was a company claiming to be DMC that I dealt with who said they only accepted bitcoin which wasn't true of the real DMC. Thanks for sharing. Every bit helps.",2676906,2676911,,,,,,,,

I imagine this would make customs investigate the package because it sounds like it could be something dangerous.

I've just checked to see if maybe they'd mentioned the same seller. There was nothing indicating it was from the same source, although one of their previous posts was from last year stating they'd asked border patrol about SN before ordering it into Australia and they got a visit from the police.

They most likely got themselves put on a watchlist by asking border patrol if they can order SN into their country. I don't think they would've had any problems if they never asked about it.",,,,,,,,,,
SN in Australia -YES YOU CAN GET IT IN 2024,2677131,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 21, 2024 at 10:10 AM","That may be it. DMC falsely labels the package, so this in turn likely prevents customs from taking a peek inside. I reside within the US, so things may be different here than in Australia, but my SN absolutely flew through customs, so I don't even think they bothered to take a look. And it appears that only the customs in Kyiv took a peek, since it had a stamp from them on the shipping label. So if that individual ordered from somewhere else, it very well could have been what the package was labelled as.

I definitely think that this, coupled with the fact that customs in pretty much any country can't check every package that comes through, means you're likely to receive your package without any welfare checks or seizing of your shipment by customs. But of course, there's always exceptions and unlucky cases.

They did say they called border forces beforehand & I posted on their thread that that ""may"" have triggered their incident, I really don't know.

But the bit that made me furious was this:

""if you do not want cops knocking on your door; do not ship SN into Australia from anywhere!!!""

I cannot speak for their experience, I empathise if that was a legitimate experience. It sounds awful.
But that doesn't mean you get to post that you can't ship it into a whole country from any source. Because that's just bullshit.
I can't make any guarantees to anyone about anything. My experience is just mine. Other people might well be getting welfare checks.
Bur then shouldn't the point be, here on SaSu, how to increase other people's success???
Not deny an entire method into an entire country???
I believe we're here to support each other & share our very hard earned knowledge with people who need it. Like the knowledge that was so graciously & bountifully rained down on me when I asked, & for the guidance I hope to receive the next time I ask.
So maybe an appropriate post in this instance could be:
""This happened to me & it's shit & I don't want anyone else to have to go through this so my advice is don't call ABF in advance because that might trigger a welfare check, don't order from source XYZ as they label it as…."" etc
And then:
""Does anyone have any suggestion of who I can try next time for a better outcome, specifically recently & into my country, thank you""

I also posted on their thread to ask for more information to help other Australian's - who their source was etc. They are yet to respond.

I don't want to look like I'm cutting someone down, I'm really not. I don't know their truth. It's not a personal attack at them. I'm targeting my attack on spreading misinformation or propaganda or ignorance or trolling or just unnecessary negativity without a point that could deny someone their spot on the bus.
Because fuck that.
Always a distinct possibility, just trying to reduce the probability for anyone else.

I paid express shipping. I was quoted a week, it took about 4 weeks I think. I posted on here about it a fair bit. I think about a week Ukraine, about a week nowhere, a week Sydney, a week at the local sorting facility. And then all of a sudden, here! Highly stressful at the time. Best of luck.

Ok. Shameless self-bump here. And then I might opt out. I appreciate everyone's input & bumps from other countries & all the general support. When I logged on & saw the sheer amount of notifications I'd received since my last login across a few threads, I braced myself for trolls & pro-lifers & just general being an asshole because you can kinda stuff. And I should've had more faith in the community - every single one was positive. So that's great. But what's bugging me & the reason I'm bumping is that there's still no other Aussies jumping on with success stories. So I still look like a fluke or pro-DMC propaganda. There has to be more Aussies, more successes, more sources, more resources that we can add to the communal pot to help our fellow Aussies. I've done as much as I can, but in isolation, my experience is simply isolated. Please reach out to any Aussies & ask them to jump on. They don't need to participate in any big debate or give more details than they're comfortable with - as I said above, feel free to just post ""I got in May, not from DMC"". That's enough to help an entire country so I wouldn't ask for more. Thank you all & please Australia, just bloody step up - we're a competitive nation, surely we're just as suicidal as everywhere else? Surely we're just as resourceful ? Do we want every other country to think we fail at this?! Or don't try? C'mon!!!!!

I do not know how to do that. I just sent a message to mods asking if they can move to private, or delete my answer to one of the messages, the one with the most identifying details. I've also said that if they wish to review & would rather delete the whole thread, to absolutely do so. I have written freely & honestly about my experiences because I wanted other people to receive the support I received. I do not give out source details.
I am completely overwhelmed by the influx of new anti-SN posts, whether it be from ignorance or pro-lifers or reporters. I wanted to combat that in some way, rather than contribute to any downfall of this site or source or method. It came from a good place, good intent, possibly poor execution (gallows humour, sorry).
But my apologies. I'll leave to mods for now as I have to go for now. Feel free to report the message or thread if there's no immediate action - I mean that sincerely, not as a weird antagonising hostile bullshit maneouvre - I just don't think I have the right words to express myself right now.

It broke my heart that if I'd joined this forum more recently, all I would have seen was negativity or misinformation on every level for no reason. I wouldn't have had anywhere else to go. I haven't yet CTB'd, that's fairly obvious, but until the first P in PPH changes from Peaceful, there's not a lot people can say that I'd believe over Exit. We should be providing more options to each other, INCLUDING recovery or supporting change of mind when mid-GBT. I don't know why SN is getting the tall poppy syndrome treatment but it's shit. Best of luck to you with your method or your recovery.

And as per above, I don't know how to move to private, I'll wait until tomorrow to pursue if mods don't act in due course, I've volunteered to have the whole lot removed. Anyone that wants to report any of the posts or the whole thread, go nuts. Not being sarcastic, just struggling with words.

Can anyone else not cry?,2680629,NoPoint2Life,"Sep 23, 2024 at 5:48 PM","I see threads about the last time we cried, but I physically am unable to. I know medication can make it harder to cry, so I would think it was that but the really strange thing was for about six months before I even started medication. I could not cry either. Then I got stoic, tried to ctb without shedding a single tear. Then that changed, and I cried all last summer after starting medication before attempting ctb again and it was such a different experience. Now I don't think I have shed a tear in about a year since I was in a group IOP. I used to sob at everything on tv. This feels so strange. I feel like I wouldn't even be able to cry if both of my parents died right now. Which would Make me totally embarrassed and feel more like a freak than I already do.",,,,,,,,,,

SN and GERD,2680099,sevennn,"Sep 23, 2024 at 11:12 AM","will anyone be attempting SN with GERD or any other digestive issue? if so, are you scared of the vomiting/stomach pain. and other symptoms. are you considering this as a method at all? i fear i have no other option",,,,,,,,,,
SN and GERD,2680222,Endisclose,"Sep 23, 2024 at 12:45 PM","Yes. I have the same concerns too. I am going through a terrible nightmare right now with a severe case of laryngopharyngeal reflux with horrible throat pain for the last 6 months now. I may have just hit upon some light at the end of the tunnel these last few days, but not sure, will have to see in the coming days.

I have had fears having been afflicted with GERD for quite sometime if vomitting could be a point of concern with SN as the LES is more relaxed/ open in people with GERD compared to normal people. I plan to use SN as well with possibly meto as my AE of choice.

I have apprehensions on the one hand of the SN being able to spill out of the stomach up into the oesophagus and out of the mouth with the loose LES enabling it to happen. But I also read that meto helps the LES get tighter a little and that the way meto works is by shutting down the part of the brain responsible for receiving the vomitting signal.

So theoretically the loose LES shouldn't matter if this part of meto works - as it is supposed to. The only thing that should matter with a loose LES is probably posture.

Generally for gerd, as far as I've read, lying on one's left side with the legs bent and a pillow between one's knees and the elbow tucked forward such that it is in front of the chest and the left palm underneath the head i.e., below the left ear is recommended as the best position for sleeping as the LES would be on top thus letting gravity help keep the contents of the stomach down.

But ironically for SN, the duodenal opening would also be towards the top thus making it necessary for the SN to pass upward against gravity so to speak in order to pass into the small intestine. I wondered how this could ever happen and tried taking a bit of water and sleeping on my left side and to my surprise the water went down without any issues like burping or it coming up into the oesophagus. But I am still a bit apprehensive of things possibly being different with SN.

The other sleeping position for GERD that's recommended is with one's back resting on a wedge pillow, maybe use of another pillow on top of the wedge pillow to rest the head (preferably a cervical pillow as it could hold the neck in place and prevent sliding down).

This is my preferred position as it would enable both gravity to work in my favour and also the contents of the stomach are more likely to pass through the duodenal opening into the small intestine more easily. I feel sleeping or turning to the right as is recommended generally in this forum for SN is a no-no for people with GERD as the LES would be facing downwards and the contents of the stomach are likely to spill out.",2680099,,,,,,,,,

Advice on not prematurely using sn,2679910,Degen,"Sep 23, 2024 at 8:52 AM","I ordered it, don't know when it'll come but likely soon. For me I want to use my sn in a year or more as I want to try to recover in the meantime, I just wanted sn now as it's availability keeps decreasing. However, I just don't see myself not using it compulsively at all. I can tell if I have it I'll likely ctb within a couple days, as I don't have a fear of death and am pretty actively suicidal currently. My mood shifts too much for me to wait. I guess dying prematurely wouldn't be a bad thing, but it's not ideal.

BPD is exhausting.,2680537,Fangarina,"Sep 23, 2024 at 4:28 PM","newby here - taking the opportunity to vent since I can't really say it out loud to my friends/ family - luckily for them they don't understand how I feel but the double edge of that is I can't tell them either.

I have BPD. I have been 'living' with it since a young teenager. Major childhood trauma I guess is the cause. Many failed attempts, SH, destructive behaviour….
And now as a 37yo adult I am even more done with it than ever before.
I am exhausted mentally, I feel physically drained because of the energy I have to use just to stay alive.
All I hear is how I'm an anomaly- that in spite of my MH I have a good career, so many amazing friends who care deeply and how my SU thoughts are selfish because what about all the people I will leave behind grieving me.

It angers me. Why should I continue to live in pain just because it will upset others. Why is their grief trumping mine? Why should I continue to be here to make their lives easier? They will get over it in time but I will never get over this constant mental anguish I am in.

I have told them so many times I won't be here by my 40th birthday.
They know how I feel, they know how I struggle but do they check in on me? Do they spend time with me? Do they just be there for the sake of it? No.
But my loss to them would be huge.
I posted on my insta story, a meme saying I am ready for a serial killer to come get me. So many laugh reactions.
Guys I'm not even kidding.

I am done.
I have a book to with my methods and plans all written in. I won't be here, ideally by the end of this year.
But I'm trying to make sure my plans are fail safe. After so many failed attempts I can't fail again.

In an ideal world I'd fall asleep and never wake up but I know the chances of that are slim. I'm ok with pain even just for a few mins if it is a sure way to be gone.

I'm in the UK, so certain things are impossible here. And I see all these memorial posts about people who have successfully completed and I get jealous. Like how have they sussed it out and I can't??

SN from DMC & Bartovation - low purity?,2668478,Andrews,"Sep 13, 2024 at 7:55 AM","How reliable are those test strips from Bartovation?
This is what I've got - it's closer to 5 ppm, than 10. (nitrite is the upper square on the strip)
Followed the testing protocol from SN bible with distilled water.


The SN from DMC was sealed, some parts were rock hard. Couldn't crush them with my fingers.
""SN 99.6%"" hand written on sachet.
Room temp for a month was high, around 28-33 Celsius.
Not sure if those aspects matter in terms of purity preservation.

Found this post with 2 people that had the same problem as myself:
Testing DMC SN in Spring Water
I tried testing SN from DMC in bottled spring water (don't have access to distilled). I tested the spring water first and no nitrites. But when I tested the solution I prepared following vizzy's guide, I'm getting readings closer to 5ppm instead of the expected 10ppm. I've read that spring water...
sanctioned-suicide.net

I keep reading on this forum that DMC is reliable. But wasn't able to find posts of people that used / tested it.
Can't browse much because of eye sensitivity to screens.

So I'm not sure if SN isn't pure or the strips are faulty :(
This is pretty distressing and would appreciate any input.

As @maynoname said, I tested mine from DMC.
I followed the Bible / Vizzy instructions for distilled water & did the 1 litre method. I used API strips because that was available locally. I dipped one strip & got the darkest colour match that looked identical to what it should (the 10 end of the spectrum on API packaging & the pics on SaSu) & dipped another in plain water to compare.

I had a bunch of interactions with L, like A LOT & I could be wrong, but I believe that he is legit & DMC is legit. That said, I guess there can be faulty batches but I assume they test that. I don't know. Are all the failed tests from the same brand of aquarium tests? Are they all strip? Maybe there's another common denominator. Maybe if people still have easy access to their DMC because they've just tested,, maybe they can try a drop test or whatever it is? Or just another brand?

If anyone has success with testing, I would love to be told - I need this to to be real - I need the SN to CTB, I need to know I wasn't scammed but also, a big one, I hate the idea I've misled people to DMC if it's been a waste of their time, money & hope.

I think the prudent thing to do would be to have anyone who has DMC SN right now to test it.

This thread has thoroughly convinced me to test the SN when I get it, so when I do that I'll make a post so I can add to the information pile.

If DMC is ripping people off, that is not only dangerous but incredibly scummy. he's already profiteering off the fact that there's practically no other sources that ship to everyday people. but if he's trying to make a quick buck by shipping sub-par SN as well, then he should be avoided at all costs.

So, one side of the coin, if it's a scam, I want everyone informed & protected. Completely.

I don't have any access to distilled water at the moment or the time to research using other types of water - but what I do have is a very small quantity of my SN from DMC that has been stored really poorly - it's secure & can't be accidentally found, but not stored in the best way - it was leftover from my first test when I had to abandon abruptly from someone coming home unexpectedly. I hadn't planned to use it but never disposed of it, it was to be put in a third cup.

Because if they've been stored in poor conditions & haven't degraded & still come up legit, then maybe a bit of relief for everyone.

Sorry . I'm feeling a bit calmer already. Idk why it happened really. It's never been that intense and sudden before.

Another cryptic message,2673051,QueenInsomnia,"Sep 17, 2024 at 1:26 PM","I haven't really gotten a chance to play much with ChatGPT's new advanced reasoning model, so I thought I'd put this through as a riddle to see what it would come up with. It thought about it for 46 seconds and then came up with this answer:

-------------------------------
The riddle you've presented is:

""When the trees fall, where the trees lie, turn right and it'll be your time""

Let's break it down and explore possible interpretations to find an answer.

Interpretation 1: Logarithm
When the trees fall: When trees are cut down, they become logs.
Where the trees lie: This reinforces the idea of logs lying on the ground.
Turn right: Could represent the letter 'R', as 'right' starts with 'R'.
And it'll be your time: This hints at something related to 'time'.
Putting it all together:

Log + R + Time = Logarithm

Interpretation 2: Compass Directions and Time Zones
When the trees fall, where the trees lie: Could refer to the timberline or tree line, the edge of the habitat at which trees can grow.
Turn right: In map orientation, turning right (from north) points you east.
It'll be your time: Moving eastward, you enter new time zones, hence ""it'll be your time.""
Interpretation 3: Biblical Reference and Turning East
When the trees fall, where the trees lie: Echoes Ecclesiastes 11:3—""If a tree falls to the south or to the north, in the place where it falls, there it will lie.""
Turn right: Again suggests turning east.
It'll be your time: East is where the sun rises, symbolizing the start of a new day or time.
Conclusion

While multiple interpretations are possible, the first seems the most coherent and directly connected to the clues given.

Answer: The riddle refers to a ""logarithm.""

Personally, though, I think I like the third interpretation the best.",2670650,,,,,,,,,

Are you a incel?,2679497,lamargue,"Sep 22, 2024 at 11:43 PM","the initial step consists of being able to meet the demands of attraction. this is dependent upon the space in which you pursue relationships; spaces which are local to you, and as such are regulated locally. you can only meet women when given the opportunity to by the communities which are accessible to you. not all people have this; and even if they have access to these communities, there is no guarantee that incels are able to compete within these spaces. it may not even be solely about physical attraction. at the very most, it requires some degree of social competency which can meet the expectations of sexual competition; you only develop or accentuate socially desirable attributes due to social response, and these modifications are regulated by communities which have the capacity to gatekeep and private sex from those who are socially incompatible. the sort of modification that i make to my behaviour in order to increase the probability of finding a partner is not dependent on the idea of the qualities that i need to develop and embody in my mind, since material attributions of your character are formed by independent observers. looks makes the initial step easier to overcome, since at the very least it provides you with room to make appropriate modifications to your behaviour in the future

incels are actually quite a minority of men it seems to me. their presence is usually concentrated in incel specific forums, but in reality not many men are willing to self-identify as an incel, partly because it is an admission of total defeat. their presence only enters into the currency of current thought when people weaponize the term to subsume individuals whose qualities overlap with their idea of inceldom, which in itself leads to further privation of social rewards and disengagement from communities. so i consider incels to be an, albeit rare, breed of individuals who likely have done everything within their power, since self-identifying as one is inherently self-defeating. the locus of their views viewed as problematic is just a consequence on their insistence upon brotherhood, which offers its own rewards. people like to think that self-identification is some sort of contraindicator to entering into contractual relationships, which i don't think to be true, due to the fact that identification and conflation of attributes which are seen as causative of your status as an incel can only be spoken about if they are material attributions; if not, then they are only alleged qualities which arise from the former problem of the association of lonely/incapable men with incels (those who are viewed as being unable to obtain sex as a consequence of internalized misogyny, or some other vacuous nonargument)

it's not as easy as 'just work out, get a haircut, take a shower, etc.,' which don't necessarily offer anything constructive toward improvement. so me reasoning that they have done everything in their power is equivalent to me believing that they exist",2679474,,,,,,,,,

it sucks less because I want sex and more because of virgin shaming and not having a community

I can't be honest about my dating/sex life if asked as I'll be seen as a weird, possibly violent loser. I don't think people are aware of how big the stigma actually is or how harmful it can be. Like, I'm bisexual and in most contexts I'm more comfortable sharing that than admitting I'm a virgin. obviously gay bashing is more physically harmful but being seen as a weirdo hurts, especially when you already feel like one

And as I'm bisexual and not particularly misogynistic, I'm not welcome with most proper incels. they'd probably call me a volcel (choosing to be celibate) since I barely tried (I asked out an asexual and someone already taken before deciding against going further). Which, again, sucks, because there's still a stigma (and some self doubt, in part caused by stigma) that says I'm not actually choosing to be single and celibate.

Again regarding community- it's hard to find a place where I wouldn't have to worry about my virginity being used as ammunition if I got in an argument or something, I wouldn't be seen as weird or less-than for it, which is also not misogynistic.

that's part of why I like it here. Very diverse viewpoints on all sorts of things and people from all walks of life, pretty much everyone's weird and mentally ill like me, and there's not much in the way of out groups. It's just sort of safe, as paradoxical as that is considering it's all about death. If you're generally nice and respectful to others you'll generally be treated nicely and respectfully.

suicide is obviously a choice. you don't choose to be miserable, but you have a choice whether or not to end it. that's why there are plenty of miserable people who continue to live. nothing wrong with that either. i'm not sure where you got the idea that suicidal ideation predestines you towards suicide, because that's just wrong. and i say that incels have the right to die because for them to even consider something as radical as suicide must indicate that their problems are by no means trivial. moreover, who is to say that there isn't overlap between mental illness and inceldom? for the reasons i explained before and in another thread, their problems are valid. obviously an incel doesn't have more reason than, say, someone who is chronically ill, but that's a problem for euthanasia and not suicide. you misunderstand that suicide preserves your autonomy, and that, practically speaking, you aren't predetermined to commit suicide

Are you a incel?,2679599,sugarb,"Sep 23, 2024 at 1:27 AM","I did find someone once. She was a lot more mentally ill than I am and so insecure she'd take literally anyone who'd stay with her, and I did that. but that's all I could do for her. I tried loving and taking care of her and I couldn't retain those feelings. I put in effort. I wasn't able to keep her as a focus in my life so we've drifted

It's extremely hard to find someone you actually love and stay in love with, that you would suffer for and genuinely want as your companion in life. It's significantly harder when you're mentally ill, even harder when you try to keep them. If I had someone I actually wanted to stay for I wouldn't be here, planning to blow my head off with a shotgun.

It's not as simple an issue as you think it is, please stop trivializing it. I know this wasn't directed at me, I just got a bit emotional and wanted to try and tell you that it's not so cut and dry",2679553,,,,,,,,,
Are you a incel?,2679610,Roseate,"Sep 23, 2024 at 1:41 AM","I never said it was simple. I know love doesn't solve it all. I've seen these loves hurt way more. And if you had someone, it still wouldn't make a difference. Maybe you'd stay for them, right? You'd try even though you're tired and you'd live for them, not for you but people leave! It's what they do. Maybe you're giving them too much or maybe they found better or maybe they're just tired of you and so they walk away. We're all born alone and we're all meant to go alone. If anything you're the one making it sound cut and dry. Are you trying to convince me if you had someone you'd stay or yourself? I think whether you had someone or not, you'd still be there with the shotgun. Plenty of people who killed themselves had someone and they still did it. You're not any different.

Never said it wasn't harder, that's been my entire point. That ""love"" doesn't fix or change anything. It won't make you suddenly want to live. It won't make you not suicidal. It's the same result because this isn't the movies or the books. ""Love"" doesn't fix everything. It barely scratch the surface. That was specifically for those that think there problems would be solved if they could just have sex or be in a relationship.",2679599,,,,,,,,,

Are you a incel?,2679655,Roseate,"Sep 23, 2024 at 3:02 AM","Then it's insecurity and a lack of self love. If you love yourself you won't depend on someone love to be happy. It shows that you never were loved as a child or you were neglected or mistreated as a child so you look to other people for love. It's not healthy or normal. It shouldn't be normalized. That's problematic and it's hard for people like you to ever truly be in a healthy relationship, I bet you also depend on their love for your own feelings, right? If they don't give you love, will you be sad or angry or does it affect your moods? Sounds like you need therapy and to learn to truly love yourself. People take advantage of people like you and they enjoy it because it's easy and no one should have that much control over you. Also if that sounds judge mental, that is not my intention at all but it isn't healthy tho. You should think about seeing someone for that, for your peace of mind. I've never felt suicidal because I wasn't loved and it didn't really change my depression, it was easier to hide it and easier to use people to not feel it (distract myself) but it was always there, love or not. I was always depressed and suicidal. Also, not everyone wants toxic abusive relationships and no one wants to heavily deal with someone emotions, it becomes toxic when you depend on someone so much for your own emotional well beings and normal people definitely can't handle that, and depressed people don't have the energy for that. It's not rhetoric. It's just some of us have seen all the toxic relationships we can deal with and it's not cute when you've seen it all your life. It's not cute when you're an adult in a toxic relationship. It's not cute at some point because it gets old and tiring and annoying and exhausting and just childish.",2679648,,,,,,,,,
Are you a incel?,2679687,hopemeetshopeless,"Sep 23, 2024 at 4:08 AM","TLDR: I suck and am too shallow to be with anyone that would be willing to date or love me, so I deserve to be and die alone.

I voted no, but the answer is I ""kinda am"". As in: I could get laid or have a girlfriend if I really wanted to. I guess I am just kind of extremely picky in partners and have a type and if someone isn't that type I genuinely have 0 interest in them whatsoever. Some would say that I'm shallow. I guess in a certain context or from a certain angle that I could admit I am. I treat everyone with respect. But I couldn't have sex with or date someone I'm not attracted to. There are other things that matter. And I don't expect do date supermodels or anything delusional. Idk. I just know what I like. Then on top of that I don't approach women, ever. Every woman I've ever been with showed interest and flirted with me first (not bragging I can count on less than 2 hands the women I've been with which is not a lot). So combine being kinda picky with high standards in certain aspects (while I'm not great looking, just ok, when I was working low income, shitty car, barely took care of myself) so they aren't missing out on anything is my point and I understand that.
It's not quite that simple though. I also have severe anxiety and the mental health issues don't help anything. no one wants to date a depressed person. well not this depressed person.",2679687,,,,,,,,,
Are you a incel?,2679697,lamargue,"Sep 23, 2024 at 4:21 AM","i don't understand why you feel the need to project your own experiences onto others who are suffering, coupling that with an armada of assumptions which you need to further deflate their problems. fundamentally the needs of men and women seem to be vastly different here (i am assuming that you are a woman).
you would think that those who are incapable of entering into any sort of commitment purely because they believe that it will lead to something toxic would be sufficient reason for death, no? what do you expect them to do once they have failed on all fronts? change something which isn't dependent on themselves? try endlessly to masquerade as socially capable people when they are anything but? ""well, you simply haven't tried enough!"" it's equivalent to telling the suicidal to simply pull up their bootstraps and work harder to be happy.

relationships are social proofs, and if you are incapable of forming them, this indicates an innate failure of some sort; and the need to form relationships is a biological imperative, so it isn't simply just a construct, but an inescapable fact of the civilian values which we are all complicit in, whether we like it or not.

the problems of men and women are very different. there is almost no reconciliation on this topic aside from inane vitriol heading under the banner of common sense or empathy; ablative conjecture that picks apart and deflates issues with pet-theories and pseudo-reasoning",2679655,,,,,,,,,

Goodbye - SN,2595325,rj3542,"Jul 13, 2024 at 7:20 PM","I'm set for SN tonight. I'll post my protocol below with some other things I did to make it more comfortable. I'm really grateful for these forums and chat Hope there will be something that is helpful to others to have a peaceful release from suffering.

Questions I've been thinking about that everyone should ask themselves:
How determined am I? (Very, been in the process for months and contemplating for 35 years.)
What happens if I fail? (Backup is nitrogen)
Will I call for help? (Absolutely not, can't handle going to inpatient psych again)
What will I focus on as I'm dying, ie spiritually, to help guide me? (Going someplace peaceful and calm with no suffering)

Protocol
5p - 6 hours before start fasting,.set up bedroom, get trashbag in case I vomit, put lozenges and gum by bed

Set up all med dosages in cups marked with time, set out SN and scale

9p - 2 hours before stop fluids; add electric blanket to bed and warm up bed in case I get cold

9p - 2 hours before 60mg Pepcid (debatable but is a regular med and will reduce reflux) 400 mg.propranol

10p - 1 hr before: 50mg tramadol for pain reliever

10:15 45 min before 3x30 mg meto + 8 mg Zofran
Consider additional 400mg propranolol if haven't noticed anything from earlier dose

Log out of SS, erase browser history,

10:30 - 30 mins before Crush benzos, dissolve in little water (2 tabs valium, 4 tabs Xanax, 16 tabs Ativan)

10:45 - 15 mins drink benzos, hold in mouth for quicker absorption - idea is for it to hit me when SN does

10:50 - 10 mins before measure out 25 + 25 +24 grams SN and 3 cups 100 ml water each

10:55 - 5 mins before: mix SN in water, use lozenge to numb throat

11:00 - drink glass 1 SN drink in 2-3 gulp; lozenge to remove taste and reduce gagging
If vomiting occurs, drink 2nd cup
If vomiting occurs again, drink 3rd cup

Please wish me luck for a peaceful transition",,,,,,,,,,

Didn't expect it to hit me so quickly. I'm retrospect, it would be better taken with the meto closer to time for SN. I'd also take it more slowly since it's so make pills.

I feel like a burden on everyone
Everyone wants me gone
I feel like dead weight every single day
My Family will be much happier without me
They won't be miserable anymore.
They won't have to shout at me anymore for being too lazy or being daft.
My younger sibling will be happy, she hates me even though i try my hardest.

I have Autism and special Educational needs/learning difficulties which makes things harder for me to pick up. unfortunately
I failed all of my GCSEs but re-took english and passed but failed maths which is a core skill needed to function for basic life and I'm terrible at it.
no matter how many times people closest to me try to help
I always fuck up.
I am so stupid its unbelievable how I am still alive.
I lack social skills too.
I always get fidgety and restless when faced with people and they think I'm weird without saying anything. How am I meant to get and hold a job If I can't even do basic things like give proper eye contact? Hold a proper conversation without awkwardly going silent?
UNDERSTANDING WHAT MY MANAGER WANTS ME TO GET DONE IN ONE GO WITHOUT FORGETTING.
I always forget and I hate it.
I'm so Flawed in every way possible and I can't live like this anymore.


I love making things and drawing. But I'm so bad at that too and I feel so
De-motivated to do shite.

""Everyone is way ahead of you and you're just trying to catch up"" someone close to me has told me multiple times.

I used to cut to punish myself for getting something wrong but now it's to stop my suicidal thoughts as a result of this
my arm is badly Scarred.

I'm struggling to sleep because of my constant thoughts. I know I should be grateful because there are people in a even worst situation than me that would kill to be in my place.
I want to kill myself badly
I already tried 3 times.
I feel like my fourth time will work.
I made sure this time
And I checked for any errors, made sure that everything will run smoothly. There is a 95% chance this will work.
If plan A. goes wrong and my stuff to CTB gets taken then plan B. is to decapitate myself at my local train
station.

I am far too damaged to be saved now.
4 years of mental torture, I feel like scum of the earth
People tried.
My parents tried.

I think I just want to give up. I've tried hard to recover and to feel better, but I feel miserable and sad all the time still. No matter what I do, how much work I put in, how much I try to stay positive, and so on, I just keep feeling like what is the point and is this all there is? I've gone through so much and done a lot, but I just don't feel any better or any happier. I lose everything and everyone I care about and all the improvements and changes I work towards and that I have made makes me feel no different about life. All the loss I keep dealing with just feels like life is just confirming to me that yes there is nothing for me, and there's no point to anything or anyone anymore, because I just lose all the few things and few people I care about no matter what I do. I think of the few handful things that I haven't tried yet, but I don't see a point in trying to do those things anymore because I know I will feel nothing but suicidal and sad no matter what as that's what I feel regardless of what I do now anyway so it's just yet another waste of money, effort and hard work.

This is the way I've always felt, I'm not meant for something as cruel, futile and torturous as having the ability to exist, human existence has always been such a burden to me, it's a terrible and harmful burden that causes nothing but me pain. It's always been a struggle existing as a conscious being destined to suffer endlessly with no limit as to how much agony I can feel, it's just not for me, I never should have existed at all and more than anything I wish I never did.

Only the peace that non-existence can bring appeals to me, I wish to die but only never existing is true perfection, it'd be such a relief for me to die as this existence I was never meant for just torments me and I find it so hellish how painless suicide methods aren't accessible for me. if I could die painlessly I'd be long gone from this existence I was never meant for, only death can bring me peace. In my case I wouldn't want to exist under any circumstance as what I have a problem with is existence itself, I'm just not meant for it and I find it tragic how I have to exist when instead I could be at peace for all eternity, my existence is just meaningless suffering all for no reason and no purpose, I'm not meant to suffer, I'm only meant for the peace of eternal nothingness.",,,,,,,,,,

I find the existence of life to be the most terrible, horrific tragedy and more than anything I wish I never had anything to do with it. To be conscious and aware in a world filled with pain and suffering is a curse to me, it's something so terrible, it just feels like a mistake that torments me.

Why does life have to exist when nobody can be harmed by the peace of eternal nothingness, I find it so tragic to exist as a conscious being destined to suffer, deteriorate and decay with no limit as to how bad the agony can get, it really is all just meaningless suffering and I don't want to suffer in any way, rather I just wish for the eternity of non-existence, I wish all could be erased and forgotten about for me.

To die is always preferable to me than suffering in this cruel, pointless existence where chance so senselessly determines everything, I find it so tragic how existing beings have to suffer as a result of this abomination, I wish I could just fall into an eternal, dreamless sleep preventing all future pointless torment in an existence that caused me nothing but pain, it's tragic how existing beings are tortured every second, so many of them dying slowly and painfully. No matter what I'll always see existence as something so terrible, I just want some peace.",,,,,,,,,,

It wouldn't be smart for a shepherd to let their sheep escape for example.

3) I only find comfort in death.

No matter what I only find comfort in death, I only find comfort in the thought of an dreamless eternal sleep where all is finally erased and forgotten about. All I wish for is this cruel, meaningless existence to painlessly disappear into nothingness, I wish for the peace that only death can bring. To die would solve everything for me, it'd bring me peace from an existence that only ever caused me to suffer, it'd bring me peace from all the torment this hellish and harmful existence causes.

Non-existence is always preferable to me than being conscious and aware, I see no point or value to suffering in an existence so futile, I don't want to suffer in anyway rather I just wish to be at true permanent peace for all eternity. I wish to be unconscious, I wish to sleep, it sounds so peaceful to simply rest, to die is all I've wished for, I've always and only found comfort in death, only wanting to die is all that feels right to me personally, I wish there's the option to just never wake again.",,,,,,,,,,

General thread for my vents about wanting to die,2601733,pthnrdnojvsc,"Jul 19, 2024 at 11:18 AM","To me the supposedly good or pleasurable things are addictions and or bait that keep me here to put up with all the 1000's of horrible things in life . examples of bad things unbearable pain, lies , scams, evil, suffering , unbearable suffering , constant threat of extreme torture, diseases , old age, homelessness , being hungry all the time, work , chores , humiliations, boredom , oppression, being brought here to be a puppet slave prisoner etc.... It's all bad and evil. All good and bad things part of the same evil . I can't separate the good from the bad or extreme torture that are both part of life and this evil world.

So nothing forever is not anything bad but very good because it's the opposite of what life is.

I think after Death is non-existence forever. To me that is the best thing by a trillion times

There is no need for existence of any kind

Nothing matters. What will matter in 200 years? In a trillion years? Nothing

Nothing matters except avoiding extreme pain extreme suffering

I think nothing is objectively good least of all evil Life.

Extreme pain is objectively bad

Non-existence forever is more beautiful than anyone can imagine

It goes much deeper than what I wrote above. I would never want to exist under any circumstances.

All I wish for is a painless suicide pill that brings peace and freedom from all the endless suffering this existence causes. It'd be such a relief to simply be able to die in peace with this existence finally forgotten about. It'd comfort me knowing I could die with no risks and complications involved and the fact that I'm denied such a release is what I find so extremely and immensely cruel, it's hellish how I cannot have a death just like never waking again, it causes so much pain how suicide isn't straightforward.

To be able to die painlessly would solve everything for me as all I find comfort in is non-existence, I'd always prefer to not exist and I don't believe that I should have to suffer in an existence I wish to be eternally free from.",,,,,,,,,,

I hope to sleep, in fact it really would be so incredibly ideal to fall into an eternal, dreamless sleep, all I wish for is a painless death just like never waking again. Being conscious and aware only ever causes me to suffer and I don't want to suffer ever again, rather all I wish for is to simply be unaware.

Existence is just too cruel and painful for me which is why I hope to sleep, I'm only suited for the peace of eternal nothingness. I see sleeping as the best way to pass the time but of course only eternal sleep can bring me any true relief, I'd prefer to die no matter what but only see never existing in the first place as true perfection. The kind of tired I feel is one that only permanent sleep can solve, I'm so tired of suffering in this existence, I'm tired of the pointless, meaningless pain that existence causes and only when I'm dead will I no longer suffer.",,,,,,,,,,

The only thing is that I personally don't find any comfort in death; it's not going to be a relief since you'd be unaware anyway. It's not that it won't stop suffering, but that it won't matter after you no longer exist. It's so frustrating and unnecessarily sadistic to put us in an existence where suffering is inevitable in every possible way. Even getting out of this nonsense, we won't even know that we are at peace, which is so disgustingly absurd.",,,,,,,,,,

back to non-existence this time forever . it's like going back in time to the year 1859 when Darwin wrote the theory of evolution i didn't exist then and had no problems then

non-existence forever no pain no suffering no problems no bad memories ever

I didn't have any problems before i was born for all of 13.8 bilion years. the problems began for me when they birthed me in to this evil world as a fragile decaying small animal whose brain is capable of suffering unending constant unbearable pain.

I don't want any part of this evil prison world and evil life . this horrible imposition undone, this abomination called life undone, from my point of view it's as if this whole evil world doesn't exist and never did and niether did i 30 trillion monstrous cells and a brain that can suffer unending constant unbearable pain for no reason but an evil imposition

What did i do all my life only what they programmed me to do since i was born a child ,mostly form 0 to 7 but all my life. are any of those garbage addictions meaningful or important that i did like watching youtube videos, sports, news , media , social media , movies , TV , etc ? no that's all meaningless garbage. all i did was suffer in this evil prison hell.

Here's the good news though: The pain cannot last long. If you do it properly (rope on the uppermost part of the neck (NEVER below the adam's apple) and the knot at the nape of your neck) you will pass out within 15-20 seconds.

,2657973,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 4, 2024 at 3:28 PM","Well, I can't think of any dangers of doing this, but I'm not a medical professional and I'm only aware of the medical effects of the methods I've researched. But the way SWB's fainting method works doesn't appear to cause any brain damage if done outside of water. You basically eliminate all the CO2 from your bloodstream by hyperventilating, and then while holding your breath, your oxygen supply runs out before the amount of CO2 buildup activates your hypercapnic response, thus you pass out. But as soon as you pass out, your body will begin breathing again and you wake up shortly after, so no brain cell damage there. But this is extremely difficult to pull off, so if you're gonna be trying it in water for real, you're likely gonna fail over and over again. I recall a guy hyperventilating for up to 10 minutes (according to him) and getting underwater, only for him to never lose consciousness before he needed to take a breath. He tried this numerous times, to no avail. If you do manage to pass out underwater, depending on how much water you're submerged in, you have no way of knowing what your body will do while you're unconscious and you may resurface your face and get some air in. It's all very much ""in theory"" rather than anything concrete and surefire. This is why I suggest not doing it, similar to partial hanging. It'll likely only end up in frustration and wasted effort.

My biggest concern would be someone starting to breathe while still underwater and aspirating before coming back up to the surface. The most common outcome in the method is people sitting themselves up out of the water while unconscious thanks to unconscious SI. I don't know how common it is for people to get hurt when attempting this, but I can see many potential risks, such as aspiration, if you're in a bathtub possibly hitting your head on something. If you do start to succeed but someone intervenes you risk hypoxic brain injury.

Their responses were rather vague, so I don't consider their stories as a serious evidence of anything.

As for partial hanging, regaining consciousness was indeed described frequently. Theoretically, waking up can be caused by cerebral vasodilation due to a delayed reaction on low O2 and high CO2 levels in the blood. But this effect has nothing to do with instincts, it's rather a specific physiological compensation mechanism which obviously can maintain consciousness only until the O2 level reaches another critical threshold.

,2672472,dela,"Sep 16, 2024 at 9:43 PM","I have recently finished sourcing everything I need for SN. I had planned to CTB earlier but ended up having to delay things. I think I'll take this chance to share my SN plan and maybe clear out some doubts, so here it is:


Time (before SN drink)
Action
8-10 hours
Start fasting
1 hour
Pain killers: 1500mg paracetamol + 400mg ibuprofen
40 mins
Antiemetics: 30mg metoclopramide + 8mg ondansetron
35 mins
β-blocker: 400mg propranolol
30 mins
Antacid: 200mg cimetidine
15 mins
Sedative: 7mg clonazepam
0 mins
25g SN


I have some questions (mostly about benzos and antacids):

Are my benzo dosage and timing ok? Clonazepam has a slow onset time (30-60mins), but I'm taking a large amount. I don't want to risk blacking out and failing. I only ever took 0.5mg as a test. I felt sleepy at around 25 mins, and very sleepy at 80 mins. Unfortunately I don't have access to a large quantity so I can't do much more testing.

Is clonazepam good for SN? I saw numerous threads mentioning it but it's surely not the most common benzo. Alprazolam and diazepam seem to be more popular. I have only been able to obtain clonazepam. Are other benzos preferable for some reason?

Are antacids necessary? It seems there is a lot of controversy around this. They were once recommended by PPH but were removed from their protocol. Some sources claim it has little effect and others say it will make you conscious for longer (1, 2). That's why I chose a small dose (only 200mg, as opposed to the 800mg recommended by PPH). Since I'm taking benzos to (hopefully) get sedated, are antacids really going to have any negative effect on how long I stay conscious? Does a low dosage like 200mg of cimetidine even make any difference on comfort or SN absorption?

Most sources recommend fasting and not drinking anything but water during the protocol execution. SN supposedly tastes fine (just a bit salty), but I'm not sure I will like it and I want the last taste that I will ever feel to be something good. Some sources recommend mouthwash or gum. I plan to chew on some gummies and (probably) spit them after taking the SN drink. Is this going to have any negative side effect? Am I more likely to vomit because of this?

Any feedback is welcome. Thanks for your time!",,,,,,,,,,
,2672781,nasigoreng99,"Sep 17, 2024 at 8:04 AM","Its just my personal opinion after reading around SaSu:
1. 7mg clonazepam is equivalent to 1/3 dosage of oxazepam which is recommended by PPH. And 15 mins is quite a long timing as you fasted and you crushed the clonazepam. There could be risk of you falling asleep before taking SN. Another risk is vomiting in sleep. If i were you i might take less than 7mg, just to have the benefit of benzo to calm you down and reduce anxiety rather than knocking you out and fail.
2. Every benzo has different onset. You might need to research about this. And also everyone has different tolerance to benzo.
3. Based on latest PPH, antacids is no longer needed. But if you had gastric problem, you can take simple OTC antacid rather than cimetidine. Because the OTC antacid will have less benign effect but also help reducing stomach pain due to gastric issue.
4. Gum is best idea. As many people will induce dry retching when taste something bad. But i will take gum after the SN just to kill the bad taste.

,2673433,dela,"Sep 17, 2024 at 7:22 PM","Thanks for you reply!


I was a bit skeptical about my benzo setup. I haven't found much discussion on clonazepam dosage. PPH recommends 600mg of oxazepam or 500mg of diazepam. According to https://www.benzo.org.uk/bzequiv.htm, that's either 15mg or 25mg of clonazepam, but other conversion tools disagree. PPH doesn't mention a specific dose for clonazepam, and it seems there's some inaccuracy when converting. Since my tolerance is quite low (I never used benzos except for testing), I thought 7mg would be enough.

I like your suggestion of a smaller dose just to reduce anxiety. Seems like the safer option. I'm thinking about taking a small dose (0.5 - 1mg) 10 minutes before SN (to reduce anxiety), and a larger dose (5 - 7mg) just after SN (as the PPH recommends, to speed up loss of consciousness). Since clonazepam has a slow onset, I think this setup still guarantees I will have time for a second glass if vomiting occurs.


Yeah, perhaps is better to leave cimetidine off. I only thought of including an antacid to reduce stomach discomfort. On a separate note, it's funny you mention an OTC antacid as an alternative. Where I live (Brazil), basically every drug I listed except for benzos (meto, propranolol, cimetidine) are OTC. I got mine from a food/market delivery app (similar to DoorDash or Uber Eats), without any prescriptions.

I just realized PPH recommends propranolol at the same time as SN, not the antiemetics. I guess I'll change that too.",2672781,2672781,,,,,,,,

Overall mortality in cases of aluminium phosphide poisoning varies between 70–100%. It is higher in those who consume more than two tablets and none of the patients who had ingested more than 3 tablets survived

Fatal aluminium phosphide poisoning
Aluminium phosphide (AlP) is a cheap solid fumigant and a highly toxic pesticide which is commonly used for grain preservation. AlP has currently aroused interest with a rising number of cases in the past four decades due to increased use for agricultural ...

Firstly, it is very painful, causes internal bleeding, and has corrosive properties, so it will rupture your entire intestines and digestive system. Secondly, it causes suffocation. This could make you seek help and then live disabled or with damage to an important vital organ. As for complementary medicines, I don't think they will do much.",2317981,,,,,,,,,
,2318201,Intoxicated,"Jan 16, 2024 at 9:08 AM","I can imagine how badly it can hurt in the stomach, since AlP violently reacts with water. I'd probably consider inhaling H3P similarly to H2S as an alternative to using my own stomach as the reaction chamber for AlP + H2O, although this wouldn't be easy either since the mixture of phosphane and diphosphane produced via hydrolysis of AlP is pyrophoric and can ignite at room temperatures. H2S poisoning appears to be more simple and reliable.
If ingestion of high doses of AlP is as deadly as I think, any help is likely to be unsuccessful at saving the life.",2318066,2318066,,,,,,,,

Outwardly my life is so successful, minus some health problems. I've had to take a ""temporary"" (aka until I CTB) leave of absence at work due to my health deteriorating (secretly caused by my mental health, but people don't know that) but other than that my life is picture perfect. I was good at my job and loved it. I'm still working to get my degree and somehow making perfect grades despite not doing any studying. I have a few friends left though I don't ever go out with any of them and rarely text. I have a few amazing family members that make up for my shitty ones. I have a very friendly, playful cat, a decent apartment, a good car. I have creative hobbies that I'm always told I'm amazing at and should sell for profit. I have so many things going for me.

But none of that matters. I don't feel joy or excitement about it. I get an A on an exam I didn't even study for and I don't give a shit. I get told I did amazing at work and I feel nothing. I don't do my hobbies anymore because I feel nothing from them, they drain me more than anything. I stopped texting people back because I don't have the energy for relationships. I could get an award for doing something amazing and I would still want to fucking die. I would still hate myself. I would still come home and self harm. I would still spend my bathroom breaks researching suicide. I would still spend my days off laying in bed doing nothing because I don't have the energy to exist. What the fuck does it matter if I'm successful? If I'm high functioning? If it looks like I have it all together? I still loathe myself. I'm still going to kill myself.

Like I used to be similar to you but the mental illness one, now I'm.just content with graduating college. And one of the reasons for my depression was I simply could not fathom having to work till I died. Like having to actually put in effort to pay my bills or like having to choose a career that my parents will be OK with that I don't like or deal with the uncertainty of a job I like but the pay isn't always guaranteed.

The combination of uncertainty plus lack of wanting to put in the effort to love made me want to kill myself wven though I had a pretty good life.

My advice is to see a doctor to check if this is a medical issue or talk to a therapist or examin yourself to see if it's a mentality issue.

Since junior high I think of CTB, but i thought i would grow up of it, now after I experience some adulthood and tried many things join the army then left and went to the police(I can't believe I was a fed, I was actively assisting arrests of people like me who posted vent posts on forums and social media, I was sure I was doing the right thing, sorry.) tried to work at the private sector went to college and got a job in the industry quite easily after graduating(most of my college friends are still working at their part-time student jobs)...


Everything seems to work according to plan, I'm actually succeeding my targets in life tho even now after all of this journey I still cannot enjoy life and live happily, im a depressed degenerate dull and empty person got severe metal issues and hardcore addictions, drugs, porn, cigarettes you named it... I have to say those addictions did help me run away for a few years, but now they made matters worse and although I think I would CTB anyway those addictions really helped me cross the line... like I'm unable to go to sleep most of the times if I'm not smoking /playing with myself beforehand....


Anyway my country is in an ongoing conflict so I got drafted as a reserve for the army...




I'm going to be drafted in November doing one week in a military prison and one week at home for 3 months. I live in a place where it is pretty hard to get your hands on a firearm unless you are law enforcement of some sort, so I'm going to have an M16 even while I'm home, I thought about going to some lake at the far north near the border where people were evacuated from I'll be completely alone I'll relax and prepare myself for the right moment.

Anyway I need your help knowledge and resources, how do I make this through successfully? Like how to properly hold the firearm where do I aim to increase my chances of making it out? Is a firearm more reliable than SN? I believe so but if I'm wrong please inform me, I never heard about SN before joining this forum...

In the cartoon Futrama there was an episode featuring suicide phone booths:


Or the movie Logan's Run where people expire at 30 and ""renew"" but actually get levitated and zapped.

In real life, an artist made a scale model for a euthanasia roller coaster where the G-forces kill a person.

The Sarco pod is regularly used as the prime example of how the elites want us all dead on alt media. It's stylish and futuristic looks really convey a sense of motion for those wanting to blast out of this life.

One idea I had is organizations that work like reverse mortgage companies. You basically sign all your shit over to them, if you have debt perhaps a calculation can be made on what your death will save society in terms of long term health care and the government can subsidize them.

You can live out a set amount of time in ""suicide camp"" where you can do bucket list activities like zip lining and visiting Disney World. Part of the package can include a planned peaceful exit or a sudden 'accident"" planned by the organization. Sort of like the movie ""The Game"" but for good. Would you sign up for this?

Voluntary gladiator death matches. Cancer patients and depressed people can fight it out and money can be made like with the UFC or boxing. Their families can get a portion of the earnings. Like the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie 'The Running Man"".

I can't really explain the feeling, but going out and getting hit in the face by the sunlight, or just waking up when the sun is shining through the window - It is the absolute WORST. I feel this horrible anxiety and depression, like the whole world is so good and happy except me. I deeply hate sun and I really wonder why. Does anyone know anything about this?
I have moments when I look into the sunny sky and all I feel is pure disgust.

,2680358,TheGoodGuy,"Sep 23, 2024 at 2:19 PM","This sums it up for me, it reminds me of how much fun I would have outside in the sunny weather as a child with all of my friends which is a huge contrast to how it is now where I am stuck inside an apartment most of the day. To me it´s like on a sunny day especially in the summer I feel almost drawn outside like the weather is just calling for me to go outside and have some adventures again which I really want to but I have nothing to do all the fun things I did outside when I was younger I can´t anymore I can´t climb a tree I am too old for that and lack the childlike mind, the same with playing Star Wars, Dragonball etc. I lack the childlike imagination and lastly I lack friends, I need friends to go outside and have fun in the sunny weather that draw me outside but I can´t I want to but I can´t.

So I know I am missing out, I know people are out enjoying life with their social circles and it´s really hard knowing I missed out on my 20´s where people are having all these adventures as young adults have.

The last part looks like it could almost have been written by me, I love night time everything is so quiet and the night is just so melancholic which is beautiful to me and there is also a form of serenity over it. I too love going for walks also usually around 2am or later sometimes. The daytime with sunny weather is more in your face that I am not experiencing life like everyone else whereas the night everyone is asleep and the world is quiet and in lack of better words not taunting you about not having these social experiences like everyone else have.

The bad weather also makes me feel cozy, it also makes it easier on my eyes because I have sensory problems so the dark rainy days is a welcome sight for me it also makes it a lot more comfortable to be on the computer since there is no interference with the light on the screen so I can´t even play video games in the day time because the sunlight is such a distraction to me even with the curtains closed since there still is a ton of light coming through.

But with all this said I don´t always hate sunny weather I love to go on walks in special places on just the right day my favorite being a sunny autumn day with cool weather it fills me with melancholy which I think of a sort of beautiful sadness",2679768,2679805,,,,,,,,

Even simple things like going out to the store makes me nervous. To this day, I get really anxious whenever I go past a school and see several students hanging around; I'm always thinking that they are going to make fun of me.

But I am still human in nature and I miss this connection. I tell myself I am an introvert but, upon reflection, maybe I was forced into that position because many of my human interactions were unpleasant, so I learned that being alone didn't hurt as much.

I can definitely understand how this affected your social skills.

I really relate to you. I deal with a lot of hyper vigilance myself as well due to abuse and bullying in early childhood, adolescence, and psychiatric trauma from adolescence to now.

I grew up an only child in a really small family. It has been only my parents and my grandmother since I was 4, until I got my two dogs when I was older. I was always an outcast for lots of reasons and was always isolated. I was always around adults.

So yeah I have always been really isolated. I don't even talk to people online. The most I do is comment on posts whether that be forums or on people's art online. I don't do discord or voice chat when gaming. Just too much anxiety and distrust with people. Also just listening to the people on voice chat reminds me of school and I am like yeah, no thanks.

I would definitely advise you get a scale for measuring the SN, they're probably like 10 dollars in any given department store. I really wouldn't rely on volume, way too many variables. What really matters is the weight. Think of how finely granulated salt is a much higher weight per volume than coarse sea salt, so you have to use less spoons of it for the same strength. We don't really have much of a reference point for the granule size of SN and how much it may vary, the only reliable way to measure is by weight in my opinion. That one is really crucial.",,,,,,,,,,

Looks good to me. The only thing I'd change is the AEs. Dramamine is not effective at all for SN (see my previous comment), and Hydroxyzine only very weakly affects the right receptor that's needed for SN. If you can't get better AEs, you can of course use these ones for some peace of mind. But dopamine antagonist AEs are what's advised. You may also want a painkiller for the possible headache.

if you still want Meto, there are online pharmacies that ship without a prescription. but this can be risky as there are scam websites and sites that leak your info leading to credit/debit card fraud. so it's hard to find one that is trustworthy. but you also mention you have a small amount of money at your disposal, and getting Meto might be a bit pricey (certainly was for me, about half the cost of the SN).",2679396,,,,,,,,,

heartache unresolved…
All questions unanswered,
with death, shall be solved.

We already teeter,
this sheer cliff so high.

I think it's impossible not to upset loved ones when a person ctb. Unless they have been in the same place we are, they don't understand the desire to ctb and nothing you say or do will change that.

The longer answer involves an option that is a lot easier said than done... You tell your family of your plans. You communicate to them about your intentions, you explain your reasons, and you do what you need to do to get them on board with it (or as much as they can be), bearing in mind that a passive acceptance is probably the most that loved ones could offer any of us under current laws.

I think you and I -- and anybody else reading this -- know the gravity and difficulty of what this option would entail.

But it is the longer answer to your question.

It's grossly unfair to you that you're in this position. It's a failure of our society and our governments that we don't have assisted dying services in place that could allow us to make decisions with proper medical and family support.

I miss my childhood,2680479,ijustwishtodie,"Sep 23, 2024 at 3:48 PM","My childhood has been absolutely awful due to having abusive parents as well as constantly getting bullied at school but, despite that, I still miss my childhood because, even though it sucked massively, it's still eternally better when compared to adulthood for me.

I had one thing in childhood that I don't have in adulthood: freedom. Okay, not complete freedom as I was still under my parents' restrictions but I didn't have to deal with responsibilities and challenges and hard work. The only thing I had to deal with was school which was a breeze for me. Whereas, in adulthood, I have to deal with university where the content gets exponentially harder meaning that the only way I can do well is to put in effort.

However, I'm naturally lazy and I don't have much energy on my plate to do things so I put as little effort as possible. I managed to get away with it so far but I can't anymore due to it being too challenging. The only way I can progress is if I were to have a passion in what I'm learning but the issue is that I don't have a passion in anything and that I only chose what I chose because it's the easiest thing to do according to my neurotype and is satisfactory enough of what my parents want from me. I never had any passion for anything in life and I'm only doing things because I'm forced to. During childhood, whilst I still did get forced to go through school despite me not wanting to go to school, I could at least be lazy and spend a lot of my time relaxing.

However, adulthood doesn't allow you to have any opportunity to relax. Every single waking moment of it is spent on work, work, work because that's how humans have designed it to be. Humans have designed life to be where it's a perpetual uphill challenge from birth to death. Even aside from work, there's responsibilities and chores that people have to do. I don't understand how anybody can manage to deal with so much. I easily get overwhelmed and feel dizzy from merely washing the dishes. It's like I'm a different species from everybody else but I don't envy them for it as I don't want to be like them.

Instead, I want to be dead so that I don't have to deal with any human bullshit for the rest of eternity. My first preference is to have never been born at all so that I wouldn't ever have to get burdened with human existence. My second preference is dying right now so that my suffering ends here forever. My third preference is staying as a child so that I don't have to deal with responsibilities and wage slavery. Even though my childhood sucked, it's far more preferable to adulthood due to all the demands that adulthood has. I hope that I die asap because life isn't meant for me nor will it ever be meant for me. I believe that I should have died at 18 and that any years spent after that is a mistake",,,,,,,,,,

They can provide a secure, temporary home for you and help you develop a more long term plan.

Captagon VS Survival Instinct,2680334,Darkover,"Sep 23, 2024 at 1:59 PM","Captagon and Its Use in Conflict
In recent years, Captagon has gained notoriety as a drug used by fighters in conflict zones, particularly in the Middle East. Reports suggest that it is used by militant groups to boost endurance, suppress fear, reduce fatigue, and increase alertness. The drug's effects on reducing fear and enhancing aggression make it particularly appealing in combat scenarios, allowing users to act with reduced regard for their own safety—essentially dulling or altering the survival instinct.

Effects of Captagon and Amphetamines on Survival Instinct
The psychological effects of Captagon, largely due to its amphetamine content, can significantly impair normal risk assessment and increase impulsive behavior. The heightened sense of confidence, reduced fatigue, and blunted fear response can diminish a person's natural aversion to danger, making them more willing to take extreme actions that they might otherwise avoid.

Amphetamines, such as Adderall or methamphetamine, have similar effects because they also act as central nervous system stimulants. They increase the levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine and norepinephrine in the brain, leading to enhanced focus, energy, and reduced fatigue. These stimulants can also suppress appetite and the need for sleep, making them appealing in situations that require prolonged alertness. However, like Captagon, amphetamines can reduce fear and inhibit normal cautionary behavior, potentially overriding the survival instinct, especially when used in high doses or stressful situations.",,,,,,,,,,

Do you think it makes a difference to how people think of suicide? Are people more pro-choice in those countries?

I feel like people are sheeple to a large extent. We are influenced by what is officially accepted.

Take other issues. Women's rights, racism, homophobia. Have we become more tolerant as equal opportunities have become legally enforced? Seems crazy to me that you could be jailed for being gay. Even worse that some countries still do that. But, do you feel that- as a population, people will accept things when they know they have to live with them?

Do you think general attitudes towards suicide would change if assisted suicide was legalised?,2662371,offbalance,"Sep 8, 2024 at 5:08 AM","US person here.
I feel like when attitudes change more toward seeing mental illness as legitimate and sometimes unsolvable will you see more people here supporting euthanasia. I think at least a part of it is that it's just plain uncomfortable for people to think about such unsolvable cases and they want to believe it's largely solvable. Like: Maybe the person isn't ""trying hard enough"", or has tried every medication, etc. There are people who have truly tried everything and are unfixable, I don't even think a lot of people would argue against euthanasia in those cases. Especially not the more liberal party here. But for the suicidals who haven't tried everything, I think they don't trust those suicidals enough when they say they feel unfixable. Why would that suicidal person try something that they know won't work? I understand both sides in this situation, because you can't know for sure something will work unless you've tried it. Maybe that medication will help you focus on the positive more, even if you think life is more objectively bad than good, which I think a lot of this forum does.

I think a lot of people would support euthanasia for those who have tried everything, or are undeniably incurable, they just don't see that number of people being large enough for the issue to gain a lot of traction and it's uncomfortable to think about the unsolvable cases so that might play a part.",,,,,,,,,,
Do you think general attitudes towards suicide would change if assisted suicide was legalised?,2662391,Epikur,"Sep 8, 2024 at 5:33 AM","I´m from Germany.
Euthanasia or assisted suicide respectively has been de-facto legalized since the constitutional court toppled a law in 2020 that until then forbade any action by organisations or doctors. That decision was very well accepted by a vast majority. Churchmen went bananas, but that was to be expected.
We have organisations like the ""society for human dying"" who assist you as a member. Most interestingly, you do not need to have a dismal diagnosis. The organisation publishes its statistics every year. The service has been engrossed about 300 times a year. No rise for the past years. Only a few of these assistances were without a diagnosis. So, in opposition to those who forebode an explosion of assisted suicides, nothing happened actually. The number of registered suicides in Germany is at 10,000 each year, with rising tendency, on the other hand.

The reason why hardly any suicidal person asks for this service that there are some hurdles, naturally. You have to be a member of that association for at least half a year. And of course they´ll run an interview (or two I think) prior to any action. I suspect them of talking people out of their cbt ideas when there´s no severe illness. But, and that is new, they now openly discuss about to accept also mental illnesses as a reason to ask for assistance. Especially chronic depression is being more and more accepted as a disease that will lead to death in one way or the other.

So far the development is positive in that direction.",,,,,,,,,,

Too sensitive for this world,2680458,KuriGohan&Kamehameha,"Sep 23, 2024 at 3:35 PM","I'm sure others here have experienced similar feelings too, but it's quite difficult to put into words. Perhaps it's due to being autistic, or dealing with a litany of difficult circumstances from a very early age, but I've always felt as if I am too sensitive/affected by the hurt of everything, or as others would say, lacking in resilience.

When I was very young, around 3 or 4 years old, I began to fear death and the afterlife or lack thereof extensively, as I was raised in an extremely religious household and often exposed to graphic depictions of hell/purgatory/and all of that nonsense. Before I even started primary school, I was thinking about everyone I knew dying someday and frequently crying about it and having nightmares. Being molested messed my brain up even more.

Because of my autism, as I've mentioned many times before, I was bullied from the moment I was intermingling with other people. I was expected to be tough and take it, but my childhood up till around age 12/13 was spent in almost complete solitude and subjected to non-stop ostracism and mocking from other children. Because I was quite naive and vulnerable, people would take advantage of that. My home life was also terrible, and experiencing the death of my father when I was still in primary school as well as being abandoned by my mother as a baby further rattled my mind.

Throughout my life, I've been dealt blow after blow and expected to just.. move on. Yet, emotionally, I feel so battered and weak. It's hard to socialise or exist in this world when you're carrying so much baggage. Whenever I try to sleep, it's like I often am getting my own personal horror flick of terrible things that have happened in my life, from the rape and abuse, to neglect, bullying, violence, harassment, witnessing death, sickness, loneliness, fear, and the whole spectrum of awfulness that accompanies the human condition.

As I've aged though, this has only gotten worse. Knowing the best days are behind me makes it harder to cope with what's to come in the future. I feel too sensitive to carry the burden of even more emotional and physical pain. I see so much wickedness in the world and it is hard to turn a blind eye to it. Many times it's not even the wickedness of human actions but nature itself. I'm extremely lonely and isolated and the loneliness gnaws at me constantly like a dull ache. I am always yearning for my younger days again where I was not so alone, because at least my family members were alive.

No matter how much help I sought out, no one really ever understood this problem. I'd just get told to seek out distractions time and time again, to become more stoic, or to do yoga and meditate, when this pain runs deep. Life has really worn me out. I see people with youthful optimism and vigor and knowing those days are long behind me. The things that have happened have aged me so much and are burdens I'll have to bear the rest of my life. I hate being so sensitive and I wish that I simply didn't care anymore, but I've always been wired this way and it makes me want to die.

I remember spring my grandmother had an accident and I was left alone to deal with it while she was screaming in pain and I didn't know if she would be alright. I called anyone she knew and begged people for help and they didn't do anything. I was left alone for weeks to cry, to feel afraid, and to not know if my last relative was going to live or die. Especially since I have completed university, I have lived an extremely isolated life. No one cares about me and I think if I died tomorrow no one would notice, but I am left to sit with this terrible situation and told to refer myself to talkworks CBT which doesn't work for me.

Whenever I graduated university all the support and community I had was instantaneously cut off and I was told it's just part of life and I need to ""make my own path"" when a person like me doesn't have anything. The intense disappointment resulting from this jarring change was once again viewed as sensitivity. I've quickly realised that people I saw daily, or weekly, for years couldn't have cared less about me. People return to their families, or their roots, but when you have never had stability, you just get thrown to the wolves and expected to cope when you are lacking such fundamental support.

I always feel so vulnerable and weak, and it makes me want to die. Not just emotionally, but physically I am so sensitive to pain and sometimes my pain has flared up to such a degree that my back will become stiff and I can hardly move, sometimes I am so angry because the pain from my spinal problems overrides everything and it is all I can focus on because I want the pain to stop but have already been told by doctors I am not getting any referrals or anything except paracetamol. I'm expected to decline, and be happy about it, otherwise I'm overemotional and mentally ill.

A person like me just seems so unfit for this world. Sometimes, the deep emotional pain from all the traumatic shit I've experienced in my two and a half decades on this earth usurps the agony I felt waking up from a major surgery with no pain relief except paracetamol, and that was some of the absolute worst pain I have ever felt in my life. But eventually, there was a remedy for it. I know there is never going to be a salve for how I feel right now because I have been so sensitive since I was a toddler, and I have been suicidal since I was around 13-14 years old.

The concept of recovery is mutually exclusive with suffering for almost my entire life on one way or another. People have often told me in the past that they pity me or that I have a very bad life, but I am always expected to deal with it, put on a mask, and parade around as if I'm not a disabled, lonesome, family-less, friend-less, ugly, loser woman.",,,,,,,,,,

After Death I won't exist forever so I can't miss anything.

But even while alive there is nothing in this evil world or evil life worth missing . No One can convince me that there is anything that I have to like or do I or to think that it is important or meaningful.

Nothing matters . Nothing matters to me except avoiding extreme pain and my suicide asap getting to beautiful non-existence asap

The so called pleasurable garbage are just meaningless addictions , bait that trap you here and fool you into staying in this prison .

Then something extremely horrible happens to you and then the meaningless crap addiction is exposed and you have no interest in indulging in it as the constant unbearable pain won't let you focus on anything except stopping the unbearable pain and getting out of the nightmare .but then it will be too late to do anything except suffer and the meaningless ""fun"" addiction won't stop the pain won't solve the nightmare problem. The ""fun"" thing will then be exposed as bait that landed u in that trap

Of course money is important to me but only because with money I can commit suicide and avoid pain such as starving thirst homelessness. But the only reason I need money or anything is because I'm still alive so Suicide / Death / non-existence solves all problems and you don't need anything if you're dead not even money sleep food nothing

I have known of this site for 2 years, and have been lurking heavily for 6 months.

I have thought about it extensively and have decided it's my time to leave this earth. I have found the DMC source, I'm just praying the SN arrives without any hiccup.

Benzos are not an issue for me to source here in the UK, being a heavy Benzo user for 4 years. Only got clean to ensure I was thinking rationally about my decision; but still dealing with the long term ramifications in that there is a fair chance my brain will never return to normal. Gambling addict too, clean from that but cannot undo the pain I have caused others. Oh and I abused steroids from 19 years old till my mid twenties, and I'm likely to need to inject Testoterone for the rest of my life.

There is a lot of pain and suffering in the world, and I am deeply ashamed to say I have contributed to the hurt in the ones I care about. I cannot live with the guilt and regret, knowing I can never undo it or put it right. I also know that if I stay alive I am only going to suck more people into this and end up hurting them too.

I don't know if I am somewhat unique to people here in that I am a perpetrator rather than a victim of the suffering in life. I don't know if anyone else is the same?


I do not have the balls (literally due to steroid abuse lol) for other methods. I have stood at beachy head, sure of my decision only to back out. Perhaps if I went on a rainy day rather than a sunny one the beautiful view wouldn't fill me with hope and I would do it? Beachy head would be my most preferable way to go out, there is just something so beautifully melancholic about the place. But unfortunately I can't do that, so SN it is.

I still need to get an antiemetic, and a test kit. Still work to do.",,,,,,,,,,

Nobody warns you that simple TRT isn't a fix and can cause other complications with the kidneys.

How do I explain at bank why I need a will at 18 y.o.?,2680396,Forever Sleep,"Sep 23, 2024 at 2:46 PM",I doubt they'll even ask to be honest. I think I was 19 or 20 when I made my first will. You can always say that a family member or friend you knew died young and it made you want to get your affairs in order- just in case. But basically- you're paying them for a service. I'm not sure they'll bother to question it.,,,,,,,,,,

The dark web was a bit less tedious than I thought, the hardest part was finding a vendor that had the least negative feedback and decent prices. Which did take a bit of research to be fair. But the rest was super easy once I learned, which didn't take too long. The most important thing to learn once you install Tails is the PGP encryption which I learned in a matter of minutes.

I want to say this is surreal to be getting closer to CTB but it also just feels like nothing really… it's both I guess. It's odd.",,,,,,,,,,

Also dont get addicted bro, and maybe try them alone first to see how strong they are, most are fake RC benzos/ Fent / mixed with alot of different shit.

The ones i had were waaaay to strong and addicting after the first dose, they hijacked my mind and i ended up taking them for 10 days straight. By the 10th day i tried To CTB by doing a big dose and alcohol with it because i was so out of it. I didnt plan it or anything they just lower inhibitions alot, I got brain damage from combining it with alcohol just a heads up
Oh and if you think life cant get worst? trust me benzo addiction and having benzo brain damamge (also known as BIND) benzo induced neurological disorder. Trust me those pills can make life a HELL of alot WORST.

Most of the reviews are Fake and made by bots, but they will still send the drugs for the most part, they want to get you hooked. Like i said earlier they mix so much random Research chemical benzos and other drugs and fillers to keep people coming back.

Do not use for fun, Dont use it for more than the one time tester or if you do dont do it more than once a month. You may not even want to test it alone becuz its very addicting. It may change ur mind from CTB temporarily and you may decide you just want to pop pills daily.",2672357,2671367,,,,,,,,

Still, it's probably preferable to just ctb rather than have someone murder you. Having someone attempt to murder you is terrifying and you have no clue as to how long they'll drag things out before finally putting you out of your misery. Let alone do you know what they might plan to do to you before or after you die.",2677615,,,,,,,,,

Conflicted feelings over parents,2680160,losingsteam3141,"Sep 23, 2024 at 12:16 PM","I know my parents love and support me unconditionally and that they tried their best to raise me, but I can't help but feel they made me like this and set me on a likely path to end my life. My situations I am in now stem from my childhood and teen years. My mother projected her own problems and insecurities onto me. She talked badly on my friends and their families that lead me to become antagonistic and lose many of them. She would always compare me with my friends and make everything a competition between us. My father is completely antisocial with no friends after high school and seemed to want to escape with my mother away from their home country to the US, isolating me from any meaningful family.


I am an only child and with no other sort of family close to me, grew up alone. I clearly had some problems growing up and suspect I have high-functioning autism, but being immigrant parents, they dismissed any signs they saw, simply giving me a ""shy"" label. My parents didn't see the importance of having some type of community around me, and seemed content on just having me focus on academics and musical instruments (which I hated). Luckily my mother realized and put me in soccer in the third grade (age 9) , so from then on I had some sort of team experience, but the lack of socialization and belonging was just too much and spread to all aspects of my life. Now it feels like all my problems have been building up leading up to a situation I am in now, where any sort of career is in jeopardy. With hundreds of thousands in debt, I won't be able to pay it back without this career and then I truly know my life is over.

Conflicted feelings over parents,2680244,daley,"Sep 23, 2024 at 1:01 PM","Does your career choice involve a lot of social interaction?

I am terribly shy myself. I was in academia where you have to be quite social, interacting with other researches
to collaborate on publishing papers. Because of my lack of social skills I could
not progress. So I left.

Then I started to work a regular job that did not require much social skills. Through the years
I managed to build some social skills to the degree
that I can pass as normal. I was even able to give lectures. This took me some time and training though.

I am not sure how fruitful it is to blame parents. Objectively, they might have done things wrong,
but there is not much you can do about that. Resenting them only makes you feel a bit better
by making them the villains, but it doesn't change anything. I resented my father for many years

(Sure there are some incel websites, but people there are batshit insane and misogynistic). When you try to find guidance on how to find girlfriend you either get somebody taking advantage of you, telling you that you are lazy looser and need to go to sigma grindset and trying to sell you their stupid course. Or you get people to tell you that relationships aren't important and you shouldn't base your self worth on it (if it was so easy tho, your brain is designed to do so).

Loneliness sucks, sexlessness sucks and it can really fuck up someone's psyche. And you feel like you are missing out becuse everyone is advertising how great sex and love is. Literally every song is about one or the other. And if you try to complain a bit, they label you an incel, which is like a third most hated thing ever right after pedophiles and hitler, so you are done for.

In my case I'm asperger with adhd and I find talking to girls incredibly difficult, I tried to get help, I've spent all highschool trying to improve social skills and I tried to find some type of therapy that could help, but got nothing. Because who cares about it anyways, I should just accept that I don't deserve anyone and try to contribute to the society with all my effort so that people who do deserve it can have even better life, I should also stop complaining ang smile i guess. Why should I have a girlfriend, after all I'm a lesser being compared to neurotypicals, because unlike them half of my brain is not dedicated to status signaling. I guess my fauly genes should die with me.

When you can communicate without words, just by a look at the person. When they can guess what you might say, and say it for you. When you can predict what they might want and get it for them. When you can both find the same thing funny. When you're in danger and before you can react, they've already destroyed the threat.

,2657211,EvisceratedJester,"Sep 4, 2024 at 12:35 AM","I feel like part of the issue that people forget about the fact that sex is not just seen as some activitiy, it's an expectation. Sex is seen as something that men and boys must try to lose as soon as possible and woman and girls must avoid yet, at the same time, they must submit (lest they be a ""prude""). When people say things like ""I've has sex before and it wasn't anything amazing"", they completely miss this point. When someone complains about never having sex before, it's because they feel like they have been left behind and are failing to meet societal expectations, whether they are conscious of it or not.

Along with that, the whole ""I've has sex before and it wasn't anything amazing"" or that it ""didn't fill the void inside you"" or anything else along those lines, reminds me of back in grade 12, when we found out that we were not going to have prom because of the pandemic. I didn't care but a lot of my peers did. One of my teachers made an interesting point, which was that prom was overrated but that she can only say this as someone who has been to prom before. If you've never had been to prom before then there isn't any way for you to know this first-hand. Talking about how overrated sex is to someone who has never had sex before isn't going to do shit. They will still want to have sex because they want to experience it. They won't just be like ""yeah man, you are so right. Sex is overrated"", because they have never had any experience with it before. Saying something is overrated and not as good as others make it out to be only works in retrospect. If you have never experienced said thing before and this is something that feel like it is expected of you and is presented as a major milestone that we are all supposed to experience, then you will likely still want it.",2657153,,,,,,,,,

It can be difficult at first, especially if you have autism or social anxiety, but it gets better with practice. Go to more activities where there are women and you can talk to them. Do not try to find love or lose your virginity at first, if it happens great, but just try to make friends and get some practice talking to women.

,2657323,ForgottenAgain,"Sep 4, 2024 at 3:55 AM","I understand what you feel. Before losing my virginity I also felt like I was behind, felt undesired and less than others. At the same time, I was terrified of what I would feel from penetration, the ""pain of the first time"".

It turned out that it isn't the first time, it's the first times plural. It was a very emotional, stressful and physically painful experience. When it finally happened, at the nth time, I felt like a huge burden was lifted off my shoulders but I would find later on sex to be very underwhelming, frustrating and heartbreaking due to partner's ED. Not his fault ofc and continued together, but it's a battle that has lasted years at this point.

Like @EvisceratedJester said, you will always crave sex (or romance) no matter what others say, simply because you can't relate emotionally to others experiences. You haven't experienced it yet, you'll want to try it to know for yourself.

The communities and support for it suck. I don't think I have many pointers to help but one thing I'll say: if you're a romantic, paying for sex may do you more harm than good. At some point I thought about paying for a cuddling companion. I saw that existed, men that you can pay to snuggle and potentially have sex with. Just thinking of that made me cry my eyes out several times. I know I'd become emotionally involved with the person and try to make him fall in love with me.

What worked for me to eventually get sex was working with guys at university on projects, get to know them, start playing games together, etc. Similar thing at my first job. I didn't have expectations of sex, I just wanted to get the work done. My first boyfriend I even found him annoying at first, then I started enjoying hearing him talk so much. I found endearing how he would get so nervous and serious. I took the lead on asking whether he was in love with me, he actually rejected me until on the next day I told him I was in love with him and then he reciprocated.

He was a virgin like me and had had negative experiences with women. He thought I was angry that he liked me. He was really not good at social interactions, but I found that cute.

I rambled a bit, I'm sorry. I expect my post to sound more of the same ""go out and talk to people!"" which is so annoying when one is frustrated and wants a simple and fool proof solution, but I don't think that exists. Relationships take so much time and if you're earning for emotional connection, there's very hardly a shortcut...

That being said, if I have understood correctly, you are in high school or have recently left. While it is common for boys your age to be very anxious about ""virginity"", the reality is that most boys your age have not had sex.

You still have life ahead of you: get a part-time job, go to university, join clubs, go to bars, get a full-time job… these will all provide you with opportunities to practice socialising and hopefully meet someone you are compatible with.

Kenneth,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to follow up on the invoice for the Sodium Nitrite. I have not received any communication or invoice from you, and I wanted to check if everything is okay.

I understand that you may have a busy schedule.

Additionally, I wanted to address the recent article that has been written about you. While I understand that this may be a difficult situation, I want to assure you that my inquiry about the invoice is unrelated to any external factors. My only concern is the timely delivery of the product.

Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing back from you soon.

Best regards

I will let everyone know if I get a response.
Update:
Response to my email:
Hi, there, [name],

The Times' article has made doing business impossible. As a result, I've decided to refrain from selling SN for the foreseeable future.

Nonetheless, [another website] products remain available if you're interested.

So I took about 10 bottles of eye drops seeing that people have been murdered with them.

I felt dizzy and weak maybe after 30mins-1 hour. Then stuff got blurry. I started to just feel really sick (not nauseous, that typical OD blur) and wrong and hallucinating a bit. It was hard to walk without feeling extremely light headed and dizzy and I had to sit down if I tried at any point.

At one point during all of it, I couldn't even stay awake. I kept falling to the bed, being thrown into a dream immediately, than taken out of it as if in a loop. This point is where I thought death would be. When I opened my eyes I saw faces from ordinary bedroom items.

I thought I was going to die but I did not. It took about a day and a bit to recover.

Surely a larger quantity could do it. I mixed it into Dr.Pepper and it didn't really have a taste to it. I could drink a Dr.Pepper after and not have flashbacks.

Overall, not a great method. I didn't throw up or anything. And I do think that more eyedrops could kill you - it's just the price and drinking all that substance.",,,,,,,,,,

Recently I had to send in some of my psychiatric records to get a particular tax credit for disabled people. Stupidly I couldn't resist reading them, even though I knew it would trigger me. Turns out my bitch of an ex-psychiatrist misrepresented what I said about medical gaslighting to make me look delusional and petulant--like I had no idea what gaslighting even was but was happy to complain about it. She had asked me to tell her about a medical appointment she knew I'd had related to one of many issues I had developed as a result of her prescriptions. I told her that the specialist promised a treatment outcome that she could not factually guarantee. Given the details, which I won't disclose, I had good reason to believe that a specialist would witness patient outcomes and have to know better. So I called this gaslighting and was very angry and upset. I figured she might have been lying to try and placate me. In my medial records, this psychiatrist made it out as if I was complaining that being offered any treatment at all was ""gaslighting"" because I was in denial that treatment was even possible. I went out of my way to ensure that I was extremely clear in my point when I was talking to her at the time, too, because I had been so misrepresented and misinterpeted by doctors over and over again. I have to suspect malice. This is what I get for opening up to these fucking people. (My records also include some ""she doesn't open up enough"" comments, and I was threatened with termination if I didn't open up more. Should have let her fire me; I'd be way better off.)

,2680143,uglyugly,"Sep 23, 2024 at 12:01 PM","I hate, hate, hate the entire medical establishment in the USA. I know there are some good doctors out there, but they are the exception and virtually impossible to find. Unless I break a bone and it is sticking out, I'm not going anywhere near them because the chances of me finding a decent one is not good. I haven't been near one for over 20 years and I think that was one time. Previous, I stopped going when I was 13-14 because the bastard was molesting me.

I hate the arrogance, self righteousness, and the belief that they have more control over your body than you do. I have found them to be controlling, condescending, and generally have treated me with disdain. I've had one be so patronizing I damn near punched him. The see you for 10 minutes, don't listen, and have a hard time pretending to give a damn. They can't or won't think outside the box, for example, refusing to admit that there are many natural anti viral herbs. But, part of that is the AMA, who won't let a doctor suggest anything other than the going narrative. Doctors are in bed with big pharma, which is another bone of contention, because pharma does NOTHING to cure anyone. For example, a person can never be ""cured"" of cancer - they can only go into remission as far as the medical establishment see it, and are demonized if the person wants to do something other than the unholy trinity of burn, cut an poison for cancer. The goal of pharma and doctors is to ""manage symptoms"", all while making life long customers. Pharma puts out deadly drugs that are exceptionally destructive (read up on Ozempic) and then give you more drugs to fix the side effects of those drugs. Doctors have zero knowledge of nutrition and why food is such a critical thing to keep you healthy. The number of ""vaccines"" given to children is horrific now, so much higher than when I was young, and most - if not all - are absolutely unneeded. No one knows how to be sick and stay home for a few days to recover any more. Doctors have stupid, useless, expensive tests that only find problems to give you more drugs. It is not profitable, therefore not allowed, to cure or heal (anything other than cuts or broken bones) or maintain good health, so it does not happen. These idiots are always looking to slice someone open - instead of trying to heal the gallbladder, for example, cut it out! Their idea is you don't need it, which is bullshit if you want to properly digest fats. Screw the entire medical system IMO. They are good at putting people back together after accidents, but that is it.

I (mostly) won't get on a soapbox about the virus panic of the last 4 years, but that bullshit was the nail in the coffin for me. The insanity, lying, controlling, manipulating, gaslighting, and incompetence during that whole time (never mind the murdering people on vents and on rendesivir, including a coworker) means I will never, ever trust anyone in US medicine ever again and that includes doctors, hospitals, insurance companies, the AMA, CDC, NIH, ""health officials"", ""experts"", the media, or anyone else who parroted the narrative and/or participated in what will someday be seen as the greatest scam of the early 21st century. Just my opinion and am not looking to start a debate here, just stating why what little trust I MAY have once had is gone, buried and can't be resurrected.

Don't get me started on psychiatrists, either. (Absolutely no offense to anyone seeing one and I'm not trying to change anyone's mind.) Just lock someone up, drug the fuck out of them (for life), and do NOTHING to look at diet, exercise, or anything else a person might try to feel better and improve their lives. The arrogance in that field is even worse than with doctors.",,,,,,,,,,
,112559,Kooz,"Oct 28, 2018 at 9:21 PM","Hey everyone,

Been talking to a lot of people in the chat and trying to explain this method, and one user wanted me to make a post about it, so here goes everything.

We're going after a classic idea of using a blood choke, except, it will be against ourselves. In the privacy of our own homes. In a fully relaxed state.

This method is fully capable and will kill you very fast. I know this because it's what we were taught in the Marine Corps.

First, you're going to want some Gorilla tape OR a tree ratchet.

Second, get two Sackhole/Cornhole bags.

Now, depending on what you're using, you'll want to lie on the ground and put the bags on these two exact areas on your neck (In blue).



The reason we're lying on the ground is that we want to be able not to have to fuss over putting the bags on us and making sure they don't fall out of place before we use the ratchet or the tape. You're putting the bags on these two areas to go after the internal carotid arteries.

Start cinching the ratchet closed or wrap the tape around your neck once. Is everything feeling good? I'm glad. If not, then uncinch it a little and place the bags. You want to make sure that you're not compressing the windpipe as that could cause you to freak out a little.

We want this to be painless and fast.

After you're comfortable, sit down if you want to or stand up. Do whatever you want honestly. Start wrapping the tape around your neck more and a little tighter or start closing the ratchet more.

In about 5-20 seconds you will pass out. After that, it's pretty much game over unless you somehow hit the ratchet release. That's why I said we could also use tape as well. With the gorilla tape, it will make sure that you don't inadvertently try to tear the tap off... because it will be strong as hell around your neck.

After you pass out, it will only take a few minutes, and you will be brain dead from the complete lack of blood flow to your brain.

I think I've explained this pretty well and I hope you guys understand the method. If not, please don't hesitate and I'm sure that I can help you out or someone else in the community can help you out.",,,,,,,,,,

For a better idea of how to use it, watch this:



The best way to think about it is that the ratchet is going around your neck (with your padding), instead of the desk.


I can't speak for anyone else, but the method is pretty much painless. The biggest thing that might happen is that you'll feel your head ""expand"" a little more and feel the pressure around your neck. I've been blood choked multiple times in the Marines, and the only thing that I ever felt was the other person pressing against my neck with their arms. Then I started passing out, and I would have to tap out, or I would have been knocked out completely.

Something very important, if anyone is still kind of confused, then this video is PERFECT at what you're trying to execute. Except we're going for a little more padding to allow us to cover more ground, effectively cutting off MORE of the carotid arteries.




I would say that you would want to have the ratchet on the back of your neck, so the strap is in the front. So imagine that the cornhole bags or whatever is on your neck for padding has the strap directly in the middle of it. Then you can start tightening the ratchet behind your neck.


This is another thing that you can do if you want to, I won't CTB with a bag on my head though. With the blood choke, I want to pass out and have the brain have no blood at all. I want to be able to breathe perfectly fine while I start passing out and then just go from there.

Though, I will say this, cutting off oxygen and then suffocating from there will be more efficient as you're cutting off both the blood to your brain AND the Oxygen.


This will completely depend on the person honestly. With the ratchet method, you DO NOT even have to apply that much pressure (As stated in the video above). You can tighten it more though if you want to make sure that you know it's barely going to budge. You're still cutting off the blood flow to your brain though. You just want to make sure that the ratchet is tight enough to your liking and keeping the bags in place.

The reason I recommended both as stated before is that it will come down to personal preference. If the tape bothers your skin too much, go with the ratchet, or vise versa.


As stated before, you just want to go with just enough or just a little over so that you start cutting off the circulation. It completely comes down to personal preference. With the ratchet or tape though, you have MORE pressure being put against the bags which will allow more pressure against the arteries.


It will just take practice to find your sweet spot. I hope that I described everything as much as possible in this update.


Exactly, or if you want to think of it differently, it's the specific parts of the arm in the linked video above.


You could I guess. The way I think you're talking about it, I would personally tie it to the door and then the other part of it around my neck. Then I would be on my knees and make sure the line is straight. After that, I would lean forward.

The HUGE problem with doing that though is if it's not applying enough pressure and your body goes limp, then the padding could come loose and then you have no pressure against the arteries so it could be a failed attempt.

,113485,Kooz,"Oct 29, 2018 at 4:31 PM","Yep! You just want to make sure that it's long enough with some extra slack to go around your neck.


I would do it lying on your back. Cinch it a little so that you're comfortable with the position of the padding and the ratchet itself. If the handle is getting too much in the way on the back, then sit up a little and try to cinch it from there... but do it slowly. That way you can make sure the padding is exactly where you want to. After that, you can go sit down if you want to and continue to cinch.

If you're doing it with tape, I would just recommend giving yourself enough space so that you can easily go around your neck a couple of times.

You could start the tape off one side of your neck and apply it there, then go over one bag, then the other. After you feel like they're in the proper place, then go to your favorite chair or couch and wrap the tape around a few more times, but just a little tighter.

If it takes more than 20 seconds to even feel anything, then there are a few possibilities.

1. Either you don't have the tape or ratchet tight enough.
2. The padding is in the wrong place.
3. You're blacked out and no longer having to worry about a god damn thing.",113476,113479,,,,,,,,

,2665519,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 10, 2024 at 1:46 PM","I've been cooking up my SN plan while I wait to get paid so I can purchase Meto and Propranolol. But I'd like some feedback on my plan just to double check if it's all good. Plus I am unsure of the P dosage, usage, and effects which I'll explain below.

Here's my SN plan:


Fast for 12 or so hours (last meal finished before 12am the night before)

10:00 Cease consumption of water for 2 hours before SN (drinking water to swallow meds though)

10:30 1hr 30m before, take 40mg (40mg X1) of Propranolol

11:00 1hr before take 975mg (325mg X3) of Tylenol

11:20 40 minutes before, take stat dose of 30mg (10mg X3) Metoclopramide and another 40mg of Propranolol

Sometime after taking Meto and P, mix 2 glasses with 50ml of water and 25g of SN each, then wait remaining time

12:00 after roughly ~40 minutes, drink SN


Does the timing of all of this look good? Would you change anything? Additional question, after vomiting (which is likely to happen), should I immediately take my backup glass? or should I wait a short while to give my stomach a brief respite?


As for Propranolol, I have several questions:

First off, I read in a medical journal study that was testing P dosages for POTS sufferers that peak concentrations in the blood stream occur at ~90 minutes after ingestion, with onset effects beginning at ~60 minutes after ingestion (though I've read elsewhere that the onset effects begin at 30 minutes, so I'm not sure). The low effective dose in the study was 20mg, so I'm quadrupling it for myself since I'm dealing with SN here and that can make your heart go bonkers. I know the old dosage suggested by the PPH and forum members used to be anywhere from 400mg to 620mg, but this is an extremely high dose and apparently this is inadvisable due to risk of atrial fibrillation, heart arrhythmia, and other unforeseen side effects. Additionally, if one fails with SN and they've taken a high dosage of P, they can have permanent heart issues. And for heart rate reduction, a therapeutic dose for anxiety is enough (10-30mg) for a measurable reduction in heart rate, and higher and higher doses possibly have diminishing returns with increased side effects and risks. So a lower dosage is better it seems, and as such I think 80mg is probably my best bet, as opposed to several hundred mg. Besides, I'm not trying to completely eliminate tachycardia. I just don't want to endure potentially 200 fucking beats per minute till I pass out, so if I can get that down to something like 120-140, I'm cool with that. When I had a lung collapse, my heart rate almost reached 190 at one point and generally hovered between the 170's and the 180's (same trigger mechanism as SN: substantially reduced oxygen saturation, triggering the brain to increase heart rate to compensate). It was so uncomfortable and disconcerting. A lot of people say tachycardia is nothing to worry about and won't add any distress, but absolutely not in my case. I do not want to experience that again. So I'd like to avoid that in my final moments since SN has more than enough discomforting effects. While Propranolol is now seen as a luxury item, it's almost a necessity for me.

My questions here are:

Is 80mg total a good dose in your opinion? Should I up it a bit to to get my desired heart rate range? Or is 80mg too high for a first time dose (never took the med before)? It's higher than a therapeutic dose (since we're talking about SN here and I'll definitely need something a bit stronger than that), but it's lower than some of the dosages other members have used years ago which ranged from 120-320mg (and going further back, as previously stated, 400-620mg!).

How about the timing of ingestion? A user here on SS reported peak effects of Propranolol at around 47 minutes, while medical studies show the effects kick in fully at around 60-90 minutes, so I'm not sure here. This is why I've spaced out the dose, taking 40mg 90min prior so it for sure reaches peak concentration by the time I take my SN, and another 40mg 40 min before SN that should begin taking some additional effect by then; in theory, the concentration will continue to increase while I'm enduring the symptoms of SN, so it may help as I'm going through it. Does this sounds like a good plan? Anyone have any additional information about the effective timing of this drug?

Is it alright taking the second Propran at the same time as the Meto? I've researched both drugs, and they have no interactions. But will taking these two drugs at the same time inhibit their abilities to saturate my blood stream quick enough? They'll have about 40 minutes to enter the bloodstream and concentrate.

Anyone taking Propranolol for a medical issue that could offer some insight into dosage and subsequent effects? Any words of advice?

Anyone else using P in their SN plan have any feedback here? What's your dosage and timing for P and the reasoning behind it?

I don't have any experience with propranalol or benzos so I'm leaning towards forgoing them than have them ruin my plan and render me unable to drink my second or even first cup. Maybe i will take just a few (normal dose), only enough to calm my inevitable anxiety if i manage to get them but other than that I'm only counting on the sn itself. So if you don't have experience with them and you couldn't find a sure enough data on it, I would be careful not to let it affect my plan. Remember the main actor here is the SN itself.",,,,,,,,,,

This is also a good concern, and partially why I'm going with a low dose of P so it doesn't affect me too harshly. If I hear from others that it may not be worth taking, then I'll forgo it as well. But as I mentioned, I'd really like to have it since tachycardia is probably going to be the most distressing symptom for me. But if it fucks up my plan, then I suppose it's better to fight through the discomfort than fail or have some sort of side effect from the medication screw me over.

There are reports of people found with their second cup still full, but it wouldn't hurt to do your best. I am more relaxed about the propranalol because my resting heart beat normally reaches tachycardia, usually 130 and above, I'm used to the feeling, just uncomfortable. Could be why I'm not much worried about propranalol, I'm sure it wouldn't hurt to have it though. How much will it help against the heart beat sn causes? Not sure.",2666593,,,,,,,,,

I will take 80mg just for mental thingy and the rest as per PPH, mixed with SN. I think with a empty stomach it gets quickly in the system I think.

If we were to go by PPH he has said the deaths were peaceful with that protocol. So I will trust him on that.

,2663522,Forever Sleep,"Sep 9, 2024 at 2:33 AM","I suspect we will see assisted suicide being available to terminally ill, maybe chronically ill people one day. I can even see it becoming available for the more debilitating cases of mental illness. I wonder if it will ever be accessible to relatively 'healthy' people who simply want out. I suspect not but, sometimes I wonder what would have to change for that to change.

I think it would have to be something huge that shakes capitalism/ consumerism at its core. That makes life so miserable for everyone- including the ruling classes and parents that, they start to see the sense in letting troublesome/ burdensome people escape.

Sometimes I think about AI. Let's say AI comes in in a big way and swallows up a lot of jobs. The ruling classes will presumably still be ok. They have the money to buy and develop all that stuff. Presumably, they still earn their money by selling stuff to others. What about the people who can't find jobs now though? They can no longer pay for it- which I imagine would lead to extreme poverty, rebellion etc. In which case- maybe they will start to let people leave early. Maybe they're willing to support a percentage of people with welfare but, it surely won't extend to masses of people. Maybe an extreme global warming disaster or attack by aliens could also make life difficult for everyone.

It's kind of depressing really. Trying to figure out a situation in which it would benefit and make sense to them to start letting people leave humanely. I suppose the scary part is, it could start to resemble a holocaust of sorts. It wouldn't exactly be targetting a group of 'undesirables' but, their lives would perhaps be allowed to become so shit that they'll be queuing up to leave.

I suspect another problem we're bound to run up against soon is an increasingly aging population thanks to the wonders of modern medicine. More and more people taking out of the money pot at the end of their lives and maybe not enough coming in at the other end. I don't know much about economics. Does anyone here? What do the statistics look like? Are enough young and middle aged people earning enough and paying their taxes to support their grandparents? I'm sure the money men in our governments would probably welcome a culling of our old folk.

What do you think? Do you even waste time thinking about this sort of thing when it all seems so unlikely and so far off? If it ever happens. Likely not in our lifetimes. Seems like we will either have to wait till our lives have become so terrible that even doctors think we're a lost cause or, we take matters into our own hands.",,,,,,,,,,
,2663527,Darkover,"Sep 9, 2024 at 2:43 AM","it would require a deep reevaluation of how society views life, death, suffering, and autonomy, as well as ensuring there are structures in place to protect vulnerable individuals from coercion or abuse.
A large portion of society would need to view assisted suicide as a legitimate and compassionate choice, especially for those suffering from incurable illness, chronic pain, or extreme mental suffering

As for the aging population, you're absolutely right—this is a problem many economies are facing. In countries with high life expectancy and low birth rates, fewer young workers are available to support older generations through taxes and social welfare systems. If healthcare and pension costs for the elderly balloon, governments may struggle to fund these programs. Some experts are already warning about potential intergenerational conflicts, where the young might resent the financial burden of supporting a growing number of elderly people. This could influence future debates about the rights of older individuals to choose assisted suicide, especially if economic resources become strained.",,,,,,,,,,
,2663543,schrei_nach_liebe,"Sep 9, 2024 at 3:10 AM","I think religion needs to be abandoned, which is pretty unlikely here in the US, and many other places. You've got so many lobbyists too. You brought up AI, I think of AI and the death of the internet insofar as being a place where you can somewhat identify content and find things you're looking for, now if you try to use a search engine they're all basically broken because of all the vapid slop being mindlessly generated for clicks by AI. I'm also thinking about the inevitable next financial crash. I think if things continue to head down this road people might start thinking like me that there really isn't any sanctity in human life, human life is an unfortunate accident of nature, there's no point to being here, we're going to continue to get less and less out of life compared to what we put in.

Something lots of people don't realize is that medicine is not chiefly controlled by the government here, but rather boards of nursing and other boards for MDs, who are probably controlled by insurance and pharmaceutical corporations directly or indirectly. Those boards are pretty opaque to citizens and the parasites in the government and on Wall Street. It doesn't matter whether we vote for incompetent crooked socialists (I'm talking about the politicians) or libertarians. Religion is the first uncrossable red line. Socialized medicine just isn't possible here, the country just isn't set up that way. I'm in healthcare, and I'm from a socialized medicine country, it just can't work. The quality of healthcare in America is atrocious and I feel wrong calling it healthcare without putting ""healthcare"" in quotes. But I know the healthcare everywhere else is appreciably worse and even less accessible in spite of everyone having the right to it and it being of maybe lower cost, but usually not in total. I think out of all the systems I've seen and actually used, the German healthcare system is probably the only framework that could feasibly be implemented here, but that's still a hell of a stretch. The US would be better off being dissolved and broken up into independent countries, there's just too much to muddy the water with how large the government and how opposite people's values are, and how the individual states are set up, and so many other things.",,,,,,,,,,

At the end of the day, some people are just more resilient than us and will tolerate hardship way more than we can. I believe that people in third world countries go through way more suffering and hardship than the average first worlder but you don't really see many third worlders wanting to kill themselves.

,2663708,Alexei_Kirillov,"Sep 9, 2024 at 7:32 AM","I think there would have to be a major cultural shift in the extent to which we value individual life (or maybe more accurately, in the criteria that we deem makes a life ""worth living,"" which right now is boiled down to simply ""existence,"" regardless of things like quality of life). Two thousand years of Christianity hammering home the point that every soul has irreplaceable and equal value is not so easily undone, no matter how secular your society becomes. In fact, this viewpoint seems to just be getting more and more entrenched because we've forgotten where it came from, and that it is in no way ""self-evident,"" that, like other beliefs, it was manufactured to serve a purpose.

And admittedly, upholding the value of each individual life has served the Western world very well up until now, but there comes a time when one has to critically examine their beliefs and decide whether or not they still hold water. I'm sure many people would perform such an evaluation and still come out the other side believing in the sanctity of life, but many others wouldn't, and once a critical mass of people recognize that belief for what it is (ie. as a product of faith, not something objective/self-evident/proven), it would no longer hold enough cultural sway to impede MAID policies.",,,,,,,,,,
,2663860,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 9, 2024 at 10:07 AM","I think first, religion has to either go the way of the dinosaur (an impossibility, given humans natural tendency toward religious thinking even in atheist worldviews), or modified to be less life-affirming. Many religions are the center piece of what drives the average person's view that life has value and must be protracted at any cost, as well as the idea that your life is not yours to do with as you wish. Religion can also be what prevents others from committing suicide, as scriptures and words of priests will tell you that a hell awaits you (Catholicism, Christianity, Islam, to name a few examples). So religious people will do all they can to prevent you from turning your back on God with such a poignant life renouncing act.

Second, cultures need to become much more comfortable around death. Western society, of which I have personal experience with (I can't speak on other cultures), treats death and by extension suicide as boogeymen. Sometimes even the mere mention of these things can be like mentioning Voldemort's name, though with the rise in dark humor this has lessened a bit. People joke about suicide all the time, which opens the door to talking about it more in a serious context. Death is seen as this far off event that isn't worth considering or pondering on; some go as far as to think they won't die, for technology will save them and they'll live forever (some of the more extreme techno-optimists). I happen to agree with ExistentialGoof (a Right to Die advocate on Reddit, X, and his blog schopenhaueronmars.com), people are afraid of others making these decisions for themselves for multiple reasons: One, your suicide would cause them to seriously question and examine their own reasons for living, and they may be worried that they'll consider suicide a valid option (and since suicide is such a boogeyman concept to be ran from, this is obviously bad for them). Two, your act of suicide directly rejects and denounces everything they feel is good. Schopenhauer mentioned this, albeit in the religious context but it's still highly relevant, ""May it not be this—that the voluntary surrender of life is a bad compliment for him who said that all things were very good? If this is so, it offers another instance of the crass optimism of these religions—denouncing suicide to escape being denounced by it."" So your act of suicide is essentially an insult to everything they hold dear, and in order to avoid it they'd rather denounce the denouncement of it to escape being denounced. Three, people are generally too attached to others like family, friends, and pets (though most people are gracious enough to their pets to euthanize them when the suffering becomes too great, fortunately!). I happen to have an idealistic and unrealistic view of love, where if you love someone you should love them enough to let them go. Your concerns shouldn't be about you, as is often the case between two parties when one of them is suicidal (""oh, but what about me?"" ""how do you think this makes me feel?"" we've all heard that bullshit, you know how it goes), but about the other individual who wants to die. If you listen to them and take into account the suffering they experience, you should be entirely accepting and allowing of them taking their leave. You don't have to like it, but actively interfering by getting them involuntarily held, confiscating their methods, and supervising them is not the way to go about things if we are to treat each other as ends themselves rather than mere means to an end. I would never request that my last friend and remaining family stay so I can avoid some soul searching. It is THEIR lives, and I don't dictate what they do with them. I love them, but I would never want to violate their bodily autonomy and right to self-determination. I don't get super attached since this would be a threat to that ideal. Again, as I said, I have idealistic standards of what love should be.

Third, Society would need a restructure, or at least a modification to how it currently functions. Right now, there are numerous reasons besides the religious one as to why people do not recognize the Right to Die. Tax revenue, consumer spending, service use, procreation, productivity, etc. I don't know if this is necessarily possible either, but society would need to move away from essentially treating their population as chattel slaves, and more as free-willing participants.

I'm beginning to lose my train of thought here and my brain is running on steam, so I'm gonna leave it here. Sorry about that. But a lot would need to change for a Right to Die for all to be implemented. It is a multifaceted issue with much nuance.",,,,,,,,,,

UK: Citizens' jury backs assisted dying law change,2667803,Jojogu,"Sep 12, 2024 at 6:17 PM","The first ""citizens' jury"" on assisted dying in England has backed a change in the law to allow people who are terminally ill to end their life.

A jury of 28 people concluded it should be an option for those judged to have capacity to make their own decisions.

While it has no legal powers, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, which set up the jury, said it represented a crucial new piece of evidence in the debate as it allowed the public to consider the issues more deeply than they could in surveys.

However, campaigners questioned the validity of the exercise, as a majority of those recruited were already in favour of changing the law.

Dr Gordon Macdonald, of the Care Not Killing campaign group, said: ""A jury in a court of law must be rigorously impartial with no strong views about the case they are judging.

""So, what could have been a serious contribution to this important debate seemingly fails the impartiality test.""

However, Nuffield Council on Bioethics director Danielle Hamm said that in such a ""highly complex, sensitive and ethically charged"" debate as assisted dying, a citizens' jury allowed more in-depth consideration to be given to the issue, as well as exploring the reasons for people forming their views.

The council said it had set up the jury because of the growing interest in the issue.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer supports a change in the law in England and has committed to holding a vote on it.

A bill proposing changing the law in Scotland is due to be debated in the autumn.

Meanwhile, politicians in Jersey and the Isle of Man have already backed plans to introduce assisted dying.

Thinking deeply

The jury spent eight weeks listening to experts and campaigners and reviewing evidence.

It was drawn up to be representative of the general public, both in terms of demographics and age as well as attitudes to assisted dying. This meant a majority - 17 - of those who took part were in favour of assisted dying at the start, in line with polling.

Alongside asking them whether they wanted to see a change in the law, the jury was also asked why.

Of the 28 who voted, 20 ended up backing assisted dying at the end, with seven against it. One person remained undecided. Members of the jury changed their views both ways.

The jury supported both physician-assisted suicide, where the health professional prescribes lethal drugs for eligible patients to take themselves, and voluntary euthanasia, where a health professional administers the drugs to the patient.

The most common reasons for backing a change were to stop people living in pain at the end of their lives, giving people the knowledge they can die with dignity, and the importance of allowing people options and choice.

However, concerns were expressed that a new right to assisted dying could lead to it being misused if the right safeguarding was not put in place and could lead to a loss of funding for end-of-life care.

Ashok, 53, a social worker who took part in the citizen's jury, said he was ""on the fence"" when the process started, but had been convinced by the evidence put forward to vote in favour of changing the law.

""You need safeguards to protect the vulnerable and stop abuse. But when we heard the evidence and considered the experience of those who have suffered at the end of their life I felt it was time to give people options.

""The jury was really challenging, it was upsetting at points, but it made us really think about the issue deeply.""

Assisted dying is already allowed in some US states, Australia and parts of Europe.

Sarah Wootton, chief executive of campaign group Dignity in Dying, said the results showed the ""clear strength of public opinion"".

""It's clear that when people are given time to look at this issue in-depth, examine all the evidence and hear different perspectives on the debate, they continue to overwhelmingly support change.

""It is inarguable that the public wants this reform to happen.""

Carotid triangle | Triangles of the neck | Head and Neck
Topographical regions known as triangles of the neck, their borders and contents.
anatomy.app

You'll note that they overlap one another. So the jugulars (blue vessels) go first, then the carotids (big red vessels behind the sternocleidomastoid muscle). This is why speed and force is advised for partial, since if you pussyfoot it and go gently/slowly you'll just get the exploding head feeling from only occluding the jugulars or occluding the carotids too late. With full, everything gets closed immediately - jugulars, carotids, trachea, possibly even enough force to hit your vagus nerve and you'll go into cardiac arrest (one of the possible ways full suspension can kill you).

Hanging already provides speedy unconsciousness anyways, as most videos I've seen the individual hanging themselves loses consciousness in 5-13 seconds. Compare this to something like SN, where you gotta wait around for up to 20 minutes enduring multiple symptoms and some suffering before you pass out. So I wouldn't concern yourself with trying to speed the process up, as it's already pretty damn quick. The main problem is SI, but that's a concern for all methods really.",,,,,,,,,,

I can't speak first-hand on the subject, but others have, or at least talked about, inserting ""things"" between the rope and where it contacts the parts of the neck where the carotids are, like cornhole bags, or rolled up socks, or other effective items, so that ""theoretically"" the pressure from the rope only exerts force on the carotids and keeps it off the trachea. I have no idea how effective it is. There was also talk about using a ""ring"" of some sort, and ""looping"" the rope around it in such a way, that it would keep the rope off the trachea. The ring would be positioned in the middle of the neck where the trachea is located, with the rope extending around the neck from either side. There are no diagrams for it, though. Don't even know what diameter ring would be sufficient. If I could draw it, somehow, I'd give my impression of how I *think* it's supposed to look like, but not sure how to do that. From how I understand it, though, the part of the rope that's in front of the trachea would be on the OUTSIDE of the ring, with each end of the rope looped around the ring and then running around the neck as normal to the rear where a regular slip knot would be made. No idea how plausible it is.",2677941,,,,,,,,,
How to block carotid and not jugular in full suspension?,2678991,locked*n*loaded,"Sep 22, 2024 at 3:47 PM","This is what I think the source (whom I will source later in this post) for this ""ring"" idea means when they talk about using a ring and wrapping the rope around each side of it, so that there is ""slack"" of the rope in the middle of the ring where it would normally contact the trachea. But, because of the slack and how the rope is looped onto the ring, the rope between the sides of the ring doesn't make contact with the neck. Here is a representative photo of what I think the idea looks like. Keep in mind this is only representative, as I had to use a shower curtain hoop and a very small diameter piece of rope to showcase the looping of the rope.



Surely a larger ring, perhaps made out of metal, and a larger rope would need to be used. But, you can see that with the rope positioned on the ""outside"" of the ring, the rope in between either side of the ring would not make contact with the neck.

Why not re-create that? Those guys manage to get your carotids pinched, reliably, and without touching the airway, and put people out everytime. And we all know that being put to sleep is just a stage. That if those carotids were to be continued to be pinched the person would die very quickly.

Go to any jiu-jitsu gym. They put beginners to sleep all the time, just to show them what it feels like. The student calmly lays down and allows himself to be put in a sleeper or chokehold. There's no struggle, no panic, no freak out, he just drifts off to ""sleep"".

I suppose it could work if you could manage to figure out a way to keep it securely attached to your neck as you convulse and posture, but again, that's more work. and mind you, you wouldn't die any faster than by rope. it's still about 6 minutes before your heart is stopped, and 30 minutes till brain death (sometimes sooner, but 30 mins is the safe amount of time).

FIRST EVER SN DOCUMENTATION,541994,Lotus1818,"Jan 12, 2020 at 5:44 AM","Dear everyone,

This thread will be about the documentation of the cbt of user @Moonicide (29 years old) Who took her life on Jan 12th at 00:30 EST.

She was a dear friend of mine that I met on this forum. She loved this forum and it's users. The forum helped her allot during her last days. And the support she got during her goodbye thread was almost overwhelming for her. It made her really happy. Her last wish was to document her death to thank everyone on the forum and to educate people who are uncertain about this method. As far as we know nobody has done a full documentation about this method. I will go through everything that I saw and give my honest opinion about the method.

I will cover everything before she took the sn and after taking the sn. After the documentation I will do a Q and A and do some afterthoughts. If anyone has a question please feel free to write me a pm or leave a comment here. I will try to reply to as many people as possible. But I will also be taking a break from this forum after witnessing all this.

Moonie's goodbye thread
Please read through her goodbye thread to get all the information needed about the medicine she took and how her regime looked like. Also please check Stan's Guide On SN If you have any questions about this method.

Before taking the SN
00:06 ""I'm feeling pretty okay. Hungry as fuck. Stomach is making noises. A little bit drowsy. Perhaps because of the not sleep. But maybe because of the pills. But i'm calm.""

00:10 Started making the sn drink. Moonie is suprised how much a table spoon (+/-25gram) is.

00:15 ""Doesn't smell like anything."" used luke warm water. Clear white liquid. I dont see any clumps.

00:17 The liquid started to get more clear and clear

00:21 ""I'm feeling okay and calm. I'm looking at the forum.""

After taking the SN
00:31 Moonie took SN in a chair with a straw ""oh fuck its really bad""
""it tastes like really salty seawater. It's burning my thoat."" She says the straw helps allot.

00:32 Making SN dosage 2. And she took a mint to mask the taste of the SN.

00:33 Moonie says her throat still burns. And gives it a 3.5/10 on the pain scale. ""not really that bad."" She says her stomach burns.

00:34 ""i need to lay down.""

00:35 She says her heart is beating fast. Throat burns It's salty. Getting really warm. She says there is no pain. But I feel heavy stomach burns.

00:36 Moonie puked once (I couldnt see how much. But she puked 2 times)

00:37 Second puke. And she is breathing very heavy. Almost trying to gasp for air.

00:38 She took her headset off. I couldnt talk to her anymore. But I could still listen to her.

00:39 Her eyes are closed and she is breathing very heavy.

00:40 Breathing slowes down. laying on her side

00:41 She coughs a bit and says fuck 3 times in a low voice. (perhaps theres some pain/ discomfort?) (this could also be the last time she was consious)

00:42 Really slow breathing. Almost looks like normal breathing

00:43 Still consious, legs spasms. She makes some grunting sounds.

00:44 eyes are open for a brief second (this could perhaps be a possible small seizure?) she closed her eyes immediately after that though.

00:45 Hands on stomach, Groans. load groans sounds like snoring. kinda like chocking

00:46 throws up a little bit. while laying on her stomach.

00:47 trying to gasp for air. making loud snoring sounds.

00:48 less snoring / gapsing for air sounds.

00:49 I think she's asleep

00:50 Def sleeping.

00:52 still same breathing. It is getting slower though

00:55 breathing becomes really slow

00:56 even slower

00:58 last breath

01:05 nothing changed. shes still laying
01:15 nothing changed. shes still laying
01:30 nothing changed. shes still laying
01:40 nothing changed. shes still laying
01:44 nothing changed. shes still laying. closed videocall.

Q And A

Was this method peacefull?
First what is peacefull? Is it immediately falling asleep and not moving? If we compare this to N then this method is partially peacefull In my opinion. There was allot of groaning and gasping for air. However in the grand scheme of things. This method is quick and she was laying on her bed very beautifully. Completely at peace. Again this is different for everyone. So don't think this documentation is how it is for everyone. But the reason why people choose this method is because of how ""easy"" it is to get all the stuff to CTB. And because of how cheap it is. To me it's stil strange that you can puchase this stuff online.

Did it look painfull?
During her time being consious she told me it wasn't really painfull. Her throat burned and she felt like her stomach was really heavy. But it wasn't unbearable pain or anything. I think you could compare it to feeling sick in the stomach? Ofcourse there's some pain. But overall its not unbearable.

How long did it take untill she was unconsious?
If I look at my notes. She took the SN at 00:31 and at 00:41 she was still consious and saying ""fuck fuck fuck"" in a really low voice. To me it sounded like she said this because there was some slight discomfort. And at 00:50 I was sure she was unconsious. So for her it took around 10-20 min untill she was unconsious.

Did it look like she was suffering?
I'm gonna be honest here. At first glance it did look she was suffering. There was allot of groaning and load noises. Allot of gasping for air. It kinda looked liked she was chocking. But this was very brief. It mostly looked like she was unconsious and her body was desperatly trying to get more air in her system. Which makes sense if you know how this method works. Ofcourse your body will try to get more air by inhaling very heavily. But this obviously does not work because the SN is depriving your body of oxygen

One thing I am unsure of is was she consious during all this? In general I was really suprised how fast this stuff worked. Only a few min after taking the SN she needed to lay down. And she def looked very peacefull after about 15-20min. i am sure she was consious up untill 00:41. So that means it took about 10-20min for her to fall unconsious.

Edit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_rattle A forum user noted that this was what i was seeing/hearing. After reading this. I think the method is even more peacefull then I orignally thought.

How did she look after you closed the videocall?
She had some make-up on. So I didn't see her skin or lips turn blue. Perhas it was the quality of the webcam. But her skin color looked normal. This could have changed after I ended the call.

Afterthoughts
A few notes we need to consider is that allot of methods are messy. If we look at jumping infront of a train, jumping off a building or shooting yourself. Then it's gonna be messy. I think in general this method is pretty quick and relatively peacefull. Suicide will always be a bit messy. And using this method atleast your body will be in one piece. If possible I would suggest getting N. But I think everyone knows that by this point.

You're reading this because getting N is not an option. And allot of people seem to be using this method. Originally I wanted to hang myself. After founding this forum and learning about SN. I wanted it to be my choice of CTB. After witnissing Moonie's CTB. I would still use this method. Unless I can magically get N. I think this method isn't the best. But if you look at how easy it is to all the stuff and how fast it is. Then this is def a method to consider.

Moonie if you're reading this. Thank you so much for being my friend during your last days. I had allot of fun with you. And I will remember forever. As promised I will set up the wishing balloon tonight and watch it fly to the moon.

Kind regards Lotus1818,",,,,,,,,,,

Does anyone else feel like CTB is there only way out of a bad situation?,2652027,mrtime87,"Aug 30, 2024 at 6:54 PM","As the title asks, anyone else feel like CTB is their only way out of a hopeless situation.

For me, I made some bad decisions on my 20s that have led me to a life of hardship and destitution with deteriorating health.

I'm now 38 and sleeping on the floor in my mother's hoarder house with cats.

What kills is knowing this is all my fault but as winter approaches I have no where to go.

My mom is getting her own apartment and without that last life support I have nothing, not even the local homeless shelter.

Frostbite scares me and does hypothermia, but there is no way to improve my situation due to my health.

I cannot sit and be complacent anymore but without a gun I don't know how to kill myself.

I hace no car and survive on a disability check. There truly is nothing to look for are to on my life other than worsening pain and misery, and if I survive this winter, have to go thru the same process over and over.


I wish I wasn't born and now that I can't kill myself don't know what to do. I can barely go out in public and show my face and it's all because I fucked up 17 years ago.

No motivational speech will help and I can't even change my behavior or improve my situation.

It's like waiting to die in a plane crash knowing theres nothing I can do to die mor peacefully or painlessly.

I keep thinking about a gun but have a felony in Ohio. I tried argon but that blew up in my face. I was devastated the plan failed because i was sure it would be painless and the quick.

All I have left are kitchen knif s and rope to hang myself with no whr to do it and no will to do so as well.

I hate my life and who I am as a person but even religion cant help.

My life literally was a laying on a mattress pad on the floor and going to doctors visits. Once in a while I'll play a game on my phone, but that's it l, and winter comes in 3 months.

I don't want to die but I don't want to live, and if I am going to die, don't want it to be outside in the cold.

Why does the government make it so hard to obtain something like nembutal which could be peaceful, and instead force us to take drastic action like shooting ourselves?

And all thie because I refused to get medical help in my 20s. This truly is all my fault.

I can relate to feeling that CTB is the only way out. I attempted a couple months ago, I live alone and cut myself off from everyone in my life. In my mind, it felt like continuing to live and trying to better my situation was a constant mistake. ""When was I going to learn and realize that being alive just might be a mistake for me?"" I thought along those lines. I planned and deliberated on it for a month before the attempt, but have a long history of ideation and mental health hospitalizations in my 30 years of being alive.

Coming away from the attempt, I won't say that I'm optimistic or hopeful or ""recovered."" But I'm trying to not be alone, I'm a new member here and this feels like a good space to listen and learn from what other people are experiencing in their lives.

I was homeless about 5 years ago. It happened very abruptly in a place completely unfamiliar to me. When I realized that was going to be my situation, I reached out to the local homeless shelters and they were able to help me. Even when one place was full, they would reach out to other shelters and service workers to see what help they could find as an alternative.

You mentioned the local homeless shelter might not be able to help, but would anyone there be connected to other resources that may be able to help with housing, maybe even providing means of transportation to get there?

Wishing you well and all the best, this community is here for you.",,,,,,,,,,
Does anyone else feel like CTB is there only way out of a bad situation?,2652077,mrtime87,"Aug 30, 2024 at 7:33 PM","It's not the shelter but more my health getting me kicked out.

I neglected getting help in my 20s because I honestly thought I would be fine, and like an idiot never saw a dentist or doctor. I honestly had that bad of a superiority complex, that I didn't need to see a doctor because I'll never get sick.

Last winter I developed a rash that the shelter thought was scabies and I had to leave. My health has gotten worse since then and I know I won't be able to stay.

It's pretty dire but like I said it's all my fault. I have a personality disorder that causes me to think I'll never get sick or need help. This sounds bad, but I was honestly that dumb of a human. I really am that stupid.

My mother ate to stay positive but doesn't understand the feeling that my health wont get better, but just worse and worse.

Knowing I'll die won't even help because of how bad death can be.

I've slept on sidewalks in California and in grass in Ohio, in rain and even slight snow. I was psychotic during these periods and honestly that is my fault as well.

I truly believe I am a defect, someone who could have had a good life if I just listened to people. Grandiosity sucks but I struggle with not being right all the time, and then feel dumb when I'm wrong.

I lay on the floor and just think about how I am so stupid. My life is ruined because of this and like I said it's just the waiting for a plane to crash knowing I cant change my circumstances. I know we can't the past, but sometimes we can't change the future either.

For some reason the majority of the population will not fucking acknowledge that unlivable, unsolvable problems exist. Instead, the person being tortured gets called a liar and everyone's insecurities fears judgements and flaws projected onto them.

If people can just blame the victim, then there's no real systemic problem and nothing has to change.

For those in dire and risky situations, this mindset is ruinous and devastating.

Dismissing another human being's reality also enables further trauma mistreatment and harm.

When Earth is full of abuse and you're already suffering beyond the possible physical limits how the fuck can people act like tangible solutions even exist?

There are levels of suffering and dysfunction that the majority won't and doesn't even want to acknowledge is possible. They have no clue how bad it can truly get especially if they were blessed with supportive, healthy family and or money, two major and main luxuries which people who are so disadvantaged and at risk of physical issues never had and will never have.

When you don't start out on an even playing field (resources, genetic quality), there's no logical possible way that that person can maintain or even achieve the same quality of life as the disadvantaged person.

Frankly I didn't used to understand or know why some people didn't have a choice and in a way I wish I never did but I also wish I had seen through all the smokescreens and bullshit earlier so I could have gotten out while still 100% physically capable.

Suffering can exceed beyond one's wildest nightmares and it can always get worse. What's more, when it's already bad, it's even easier for it to worsen more and more and more than it was before.

People who claim it can always get better are incredibly stupid to me because that statement and argument is reliant on countless unpredictable factors in the most extreme cases of struggle and pain.

It can always get better if it never gets to a certain low.

But for some of us, we're fucking fucked and need to get out as soon as possible.


I can't speak to every struggle so will just add that the above statements are primarily referring to physical intractable pain and unlivable levels of human suffering.",,,,,,,,,,

Exit bag and inert gas megathread,142573,TiredHorse,"Nov 28, 2018 at 11:20 PM","Exit Bag and Inert Gas Basics —A very, very long post, I know, but I feel like I've fielded a lot of questions about this, so I figured I'd spell out everything I know. Others on the forum should please add to this thread whatever reliable technical information they feel is appropriate for someone attempting this method to have.

The idea behind using an exit bag with inert gas is to create an atmosphere around your head that is both free of life-sustaining O2 and can carry away the exhaled CO2 that would activate your hypercapnic alarm.

The Gas:

You will need to keep the inert gas flowing at 15 liters per minute (Lpm) for 40 minutes to be confident of ending your life —in other words, you'll need a minimum of 600 liters of inert gas. In the past this would have been helium (He), but due to the uncertain availability of genuinely pure He, the best current options are nitrogen (N2) and argon (Ar). Both are reliably available in pure form (no air contamination) from stores that supply welders. N2 is also available from some brewery supply houses, but the purity of the gas should be confirmed to your satisfaction. Both N2 and Ar should work to ctb and are similar enough in their properties to be treated identically for use with an exit bag.

Pressurized gas cylinder sizes are not standardized across the industry, nor internationally, and it can be difficult, if not impossible, to tell how much gas they contain from a photograph on a website.

In the US, a 20 cubic foot (cf) cylinder is the smallest you should use for ctb; a 40cf will allow some margin for flinching, practicing, etc. ""A 20cf"" and ""a 40cf"", or ""a 20"" and ""a 40"" is nomenclature US welding supply houses will recognize, so asking for either should get you the desired product. A 20cf cylinder is quite small for industrial use; I've had clerks tell me, ""well, we have a 40, but we'll need to special order a 20."" It's up to you what you do in that situation. Personally, I have a 40cf cylinder. It has allowed me to flinch and abort my attempt three times now, and I don't need to worry about refilling it. I bought my N2 at AirGas, a national company here in the US. They do not demand any sort of professional certification for purchasing inert gas, and no more than the usual forms of ID depending on payment method.

I know nothing of gas cylinders outside the US, so if you are using other than US-typical cylinders, you'll need to call and ask to make sure whatever tank you're contemplating holds 600L of compressed gas. Hopefully knowledgeable forum members will add cylinder sizing information to this knowledge base.

Cover story: N2 and Ar are both used for welding. N2 is used in beer brewing. In my day job, I use both N2 and Ar to flood partial cans of expensive paint, to displace the O2 in the cans and prevent the paint from skinning over and going bad. It's a cost saving measure. The clerks I've bought gas from have never heard of that trick, which has meant they don't know enough to interrogate me on my motives or to try and quiz me on my welding knowledge. They have merely said, ""huh! That's a new one!""

The store clerk may ask how you're carrying the pressurized cylinder ""back to your shop,"" since pressurized cylinders can be very hazardous to transport (the valve is vulnerable to damage in an accident). I haven't had any trouble when I have told the clerk, ""in the back footwell of my car, and very carefully padded!"" What they really want to know is that you are aware that a pressurized cylinder is a missile waiting to explode if anything damages it, and that you know enough to not let that happen.",,,,,,,,,,
Exit bag and inert gas megathread,142575,TiredHorse,"Nov 28, 2018 at 11:20 PM","The Regulator:

A regulator screws on to the cylinder and does two things: 1) it reduces the pressure in the cylinder to a useable level, otherwise the 2000psi tank pressure would just blow the exit bag off your head as soon as you opened the valve, and 2) it controls the rate of gas flow into the exit bag —specifically, it should release it at 15Lpm, which is the minimum adequate to carry away exhaled CO2 and fool your lungs into believing there's enough air.

The good news is that while gas cylinder sizes are not globally standardized, the cylinder valve threads are —and both N2 and Ar cylinders have the same threads (other gasses have different threads), so a regulator that fits on one cylinder will fit equally well on another.

You don't need to worry about being sure to choose a regulator that will reduce the pressure: they all do that. The flowmeter is the critical element of the regulator for our purposes.

Some regulators come with a ""click adjust"" flowmeter that is very simple, allowing you to dial in 15Lpm without needing to think about it. To the best of my knowledge, these are medical grade regulators; generally very good quality, but often a bit more expensive. Others here may know more about them, and where to acquire them, than I do.

A typical welding regulator will have two gauges: the tank pressure gauge (unimportant to us) and the flowmeter gauge.

A welding regulator's flowmeter gauge will be marked in either cubic feet per hour (Cfh), Lpm, or both. Some welding systems require a fairly low flow of inert gas, much lower than our necessary 15Lpm, and this low flow is most easily measured in Cfh. If you see a gauge marked only in Cfh, it probably will not work for our purpose. Look at the highest Cfh setting on the flowmeter and do the math, to be certain. If the gauge reads in Lpm, a glance should tell you whether the regulator provides the necessary 15Lpm flow.

Harbor Freight Tools offers a cheap CO2/Ar regulator (it also works for N2) with a flowmeter that shows flow in both Cfh and Lpm and goes high enough for our purposes. This is what I have.

The Hose:

The hose needs to be long enough to reach from the gas cylinder beside you, up into the exit bag on your head. I have found it easiest to lead the hose up my back and into the bag at the very back of my neck. It seems to disrupt the fit of the bag less right there.

Some regulators come with a hose that threads directly into the regulator body. Some regulators come with a hose-barb, onto which a length of soft tubing can be pressed. Some regulators come with neither.

For the first situation, just thread the hose into the regulator, tighten it with a wrench, and it's ready.

(Regardless of what type of threaded fitting is used, you do need to wrench-tighten this fitting: a lot of gas can leak out at this connection. If it is a brass fitting, you should not need teflon tape on the threads; the soft metal deforms enough when tightened to provide an adequately gas-tight connection.)

For the second situation, take the hose-barb to a hardware / home improvement store and purchase tubing that fits onto the barb. Once home from the hardware store, thread the barb into the regulator body, tighten with a wrench, and press the tube onto the barb. It should be a snug fit; if you're worried it's too loose, use a small hose clamp / jubilee clip to secure it in place. If it's a little too tight to get the hose into place, soak the end of the tube in very hot water to soften it and press it onto the barb. I used clear vinyl tubing. Aquarium tubing should work. Surgical tubing may not; I don't know for sure.

For the third situation, you'll need a hose-barb fitting (typically brass) that threads into the regulator body. Take the entire regulator to the hardware store and ask someone to help you fit it with a hose barb. Then proceed as for the second situation.

Cover story: as with purchasing the gas cylinder, you're using N2 for brewing, or Ar for filling partial paint cans. Why Ar? because it's heavier than air and settles down onto the paint surface inside the can. For extra confidence that they won't ask inconvenient questions, you're doing it for your father, or your brother, and you don't know why they want it for their paint locker, they just said to get a hose barb and six feet of tubing…

The Exit Bag:

There are several videos on YouTube detailing construction of exit bags. I strongly recommend watching them. That's how I learned.

The short version of what you want is a turkey roasting bag —available in the supermarket, in with the zip-locks and cling wrap— with an elastic drawcord worked into a turned hem, and a cord-lock to adjust the drawcord's tension.

I used 3/8"" elastic cord. I purchased both it and the cord lock at a sewing and crafts store (JoAnn's).

To construct the turned hem you'll need micropore (surgical) tape, available at a pharmacy in the first aid section. It's the right tape to use because it will reliably stick to the material of the bag itself. Sometimes it isn't labeled as ""micropore."" Ask a clerk if you can't find it.

Cover story: you were asked to re-stock the family first aid kit with micropore tape and you don't recognize any of the brands available.

Using an elastic drawcord is important: it needs to fit snugly around your neck, but not seal tightly. It must still be flexible enough for the flow of inert gas, lightly pressurizing the exit bag, to push past the elastic and flush away the CO2 you're exhaling. Don't use a non-elastic drawcord or do something like duct tape the bag to your neck; you don't want to create a seal, just a restriction.",,,,,,,,,,
Exit bag and inert gas megathread,142576,TiredHorse,"Nov 28, 2018 at 11:21 PM","To Use:

If I found all this on the internet, I'm sure you can, but maybe these will address a few of the questions I've encountered here.

Start by sitting upright in a chair. My understanding is that you should not be lying down, and that you want to be confident you won't fall over when you black out, as any final twitching with your head rumpling the bag against whatever you are lying on might displace the bag enough to allow the inert gas to escape.

I have heard fears of convulsions with this method, but I have also heard —more plausibly— that accounts of convulsions are more accurately associated with sedated-suffocation (a predecessor to this inert gas technique) rather than to inert gas asphyxiation. However, a few final twitches are possible as the electrical activity in the brain fades, and it would be tragic to have the attempt ruined by not taking the simple precaution of being sitting up and stable.

To feel confident that any post-mortem twitching will not knock the cylinder over and jerk the tube out of the exit bag, secure the cylinder to the leg of your chair. I use a piece of webbing; duct tape or a length of cord would work.

If you wear glasses, as I do, remove them. They will be a hindrance when you need to pull the gas-filled bag down over your face, and will allow space for air to remain in the bag.

To pre-fit the drawcord, pull the bag down over your head and face. Tighten the elastic drawcord around your neck so that it's snug, but not cinched tight. You should be able to fit your fingers under it.

Lift the bag up off your face so that the drawcord is now around your temples and just above your eyebrows, below your ears and around the back of your neck, like a shower cap. After adjusting the drawcord to your neck, it will feel tight around your head; this is good.

Scrunch ALL the air out of the bag. The more air you can remove, the faster the inert gas will take effect. If you ignore this step, your attempt will likely fail.

At this point the end of the hose should be inside the bag. I have long hair, so I secure the end of the hose at the back of my head with a hair elastic. Others have taped the end of the hose securely to the inside of the bag with more micropore tape.

If you have long hair, like I do, make sure it is bundled up inside the exit bag, not sticking out under the drawcord.

With the regulator closed, open the valve of the cylinder. There will be a sharp hiss as the regulator fills.

Open the regulator and adjust the flow of gas to 15Lpm. The gas flowing through the tube was surprisingly loud to me, and a bit distracting. Someone here kindly recommended earplugs, which I may do on my next attempt. Or I may listen to music; I doubt earbud wires will displace the drawcord.

The bag will gradually inflate above your head. It will take a minute or two to reach full inflation.

As the bag is inflating, take deep breaths, exhaling fully, to purge as much CO2 as possible from the depths of your lungs.

When the bag is inflated and you're ready, exhale as completely as possible and hold your lungs empty. Slide the bag down over your face and settle the elastic comfortably around your neck. Finally, inhale as deeply as possible; breathe slowly and deeply.",,,,,,,,,,
Exit bag and inert gas megathread,142577,TiredHorse,"Nov 28, 2018 at 11:22 PM","My experience was that I soon began to feel tingling in my hands, as if they were falling asleep. A short moment later I began to get dizzy, and my vision went grey around the edges. Each of the three times I have attempted this method, that's as far as I got before I flinched and removed the bag.

I did not experience any pain whatsoever, and no real discomfort aside from the mild tingling in my hands.

I do not believe I have suffered any ill effects from three aborted attempts. I had a bit of a cough for a couple days after my third attempt, but I can't say for sure whether that was attributable to the N2. It concerns me only in that this method demands that you be able to breathe freely in order for it to be effective, and I don't want to have ruined my chances to use it later, when I have summoned my courage.

My greatest difficulty is that I have been very stressed during my attempts, and could not keep my breathing steady and deep. This undoubtedly lengthened the amount of time it should have taken for me to black out.

In the stress of the situation, I experienced time dilation —in other words, I can't tell you how long it took for me to feel dizzy; it might have been five seconds, it might have been a minute and a half. It wasn't very long —but it was long enough for me to flinch.

From my experience, this is as painless, comfortable, and potentially peaceful a way to ctb as it is rumored to be. The only drawbacks that I can see are that it requires a lot of equipment —cylinder, regulator, hose, bag— and that there is a surprising amount of time for your survival instinct to kick in, or for second thoughts.

As I wrote at the beginning, I hope other forum members can fill in some of the blanks I have left —specifically, I have seen a lot of questions about tank sizes outside the US that I cannot answer.

I don't wish anyone good luck at catching the bus. I wish we could all find our way to a joyous and satisfying life that would make death an unfortunate reality rather than a longed-for relief. But all of us here know that the Fates aren't always that kind, and so I wish you all the most peaceful relief from your pain that you can find, and if that peace is brought by Death, I hope Death comes gently.",,,,,,,,,,

Exit bag and inert gas megathread,142995,TiredHorse,"Nov 29, 2018 at 11:07 AM","Generally speaking, you won't damage the valve by handling the tank normally. Valves get damaged when you drop the tank off the back of a truck, or --and this is where the gas stores get worried-- when you're in a traffic accident and the tank gets thrown around your vehicle. The gas stores worry about you putting the tank in the back of your car, unsecured, and then on the way home there's an accident, the valve is damaged, and the tank takes off like a rocket. (There are many YouTube videos about compressed gas cylinder incidents if you want to see dramatic examples of what can happen.)

I mentioned the possibility of gas cylinder damage only because the stores have often asked me questions akin to, ""you do know to be careful and to secure that tank properly, right?"" and because I've had friends tell me of gas stores requiring a waiver be signed that the purchaser knows the tanks need to be carried safely.

Exit bag and inert gas megathread,144258,TiredHorse,"Nov 30, 2018 at 1:20 PM","I agree with Shewaitsforme: you would have a difficult time reducing the available O2 in such a large, gas-permeable space. Technically yes, you could do it, but it would take a lot of N2 and careful preparation of the car.

Don't confuse inert gas asphyxiation (IGA) with CO poisoning. They work through completely different mechanisms.

With IGA you are displacing O2 from your environment, thus depriving your body of necessary O2, while flushing away the CO2 that would trigger your body's hypercapnic alarm and cause involuntary self-preservation. To effectively displace the O2, you need a controlled environment from which the O2 can first be flushed and then excluded. So first you need to get rid of all the air, then you need to keep out any further air, then you need to flush away your exhaled CO2. The smaller the space, and the more readily the space is sealed, the easier this is to accomplish.

When you put an exit bag over your head, you are creating a low-O2 environment. The CO2 is flushed away by the constant flow of inert gas, preventing alarm, and you are allowing your body to use up whatever O2 it has in its bloodstream while not providing it any more.

Short version: The O2 in your body runs out and isn't replaced.

With CO poisoning, you aren't displacing air/O2 from the environment; you are introducing into the environment a molecule (CO) which binds more readily to your blood than O2 does. You're providing your haemoglobin with an easier alternative than O2; your body grabs the CO and ignores the O2. Since your blood can only carry so many gas molecules at a time, with the CO taking up all the room in your bloodstream your body is starved of O2.

When you climb into your car with a barbecue that's putting out CO, there's still plenty of O2 in the car's environment. You're not excluding the O2 as you need to do with IGA --replacing the air with a completely different gas-- you're adding to the existing air a new substance (CO) that your body prefers to O2. This preferential-molecule process makes it much simpler to manage the environment on a large scale. You don't need to get rid of the O2, you just need to provide enough CO to take up all the space for O2 in your bloodstream.

Short version: The O2 available to your body is ignored in favor of CO.",143950,,,,,,,,,

The tongue is very sensitive, and you can't keep it clean to prevent infection. You can damage nerves, you would have trouble talking, eating and drinking, brushing your teeth. Damage could have lasting consequences. Stay away from the tongue. You may think, it doesn't matter anyway, gonna ctb. Okay, but keep in mind it's impossible to predict what will really happen.

Anyone else here with no friends?,2660626,BoulderSoWhat,"Sep 6, 2024 at 6:26 PM","Cut myself off from my family over a year ago. My one friend from my home area I stopped communicating with. He was actually a good friend, but my mental turmoil and turbulence made it hard for me to feel like I could enjoy the moment when we would catch up and go to concerts and stuff. He deserved better, I hope he's well.

I attempted ctb beginning of June. I guess survival instinct kicked in and my body reacted against my attempt, but my mind never faltered in being certain it was what I wanted. Anyway, I voluntarily called 911 and went inpatient afterwards. When I left, I reconnected with a coworker from my previous job and pretty much said, ""hey, I'm very sorry to contact you out of the blue, but could I talk to you about some pretty intense stuff I just went through?"" Met up with them, talked and it was actually really good. They're a very supportive person that I've been keeping in touch with ever since and there is a friendship there.

But in terms of friends like people who I regularly see and hang out with outside of work whether in real life or online, no I don't have anyone like that.

I've actually been going to a local NAMI group once a month and there's some familiar faces I'm starting to see there. So I guess, there's supportive people that I'm finding in the aftermath of everything. I just started a new job this week and the workplace is surprisingly non-toxic lol. I actually really like and am impressed with the place.

Why are we drawn to suicide?,2679932,itswhatits,"Sep 23, 2024 at 9:16 AM","I think maybe we're drawn to suicide because it's simple. Me, I got so many different things wrong with my life, it feels impossible to even get started on fixing it. I work on one thing, I feel guilty for not working on another. I clean my room, why aren't I talking to friends? I talk to friends, why aren't I looking for a better job? I look for a better job, why aren't I learning how to drive? and so on, and so forth. It strangles you, makes any progress you make feel worthless, so why not just cut the problems off at the source?

Still, though, I'm not satisfied by suicide as an answer for me. On some level, I still like life, and I still want to live a life that makes me happy, and that makes other people happy to be a part of. I just don't know what the answer to that question is for me. I want something that's as radical of a break from my current life as suicide would be. I want to just fuck off out of the trap of modern life and find something absolutely new to do with this flesh, this blood, this mind. I used to have this fantasy, back when I was working in the garden center at Wal-Mart, of leaving everything behind and riding my bike for miles and miles, going through all 50 US states.

At some point I know I will die by my hands alone.,2665059,Madison98,"Sep 10, 2024 at 4:26 AM","I'll keep it simple. I'm a survivor of child sexual assault. Got molested repeatedly by a neighbour between the ages of 5-8. I have CPTSD but not just from that, school was a horrible place for me. I am on the spectrum and at the time teachers didn't know how to deal with someone like me so instead of changing the environment to cater for me they abused me, in an attempt to help me adapt to the environment I was in. Yes I agree this helped me some as I am very high functioning now as a 27 year old but I developed horrendous social anxiety and severe depression from a very young age, I am confident these manifested as a result of this trauma. I live now not remembering a day without anxiety or depression.

Even worse still I always knew I was transgender. I remember when I was as young as six I used to pray to god each night hoping that I wake up as a girl. This of course never became true and since I feared social judgement from such a young age, I never came out or received gender affirming treatment before my male puberty really kicked in. So now, even though I have come out I will most likely never have the body of a women. Maybe surgeries will help but the chances that I'll ever pass are uncertain.

I don't have any identity, I've spent my whole young adult life desperately searching for some kind of meaning, to have something to cling onto and give me motivation to live. And even with two daughters with whom I love very much, I'm still losing the will to live.

I'm not sure how much strength I have left to keep on with my transition, apart of me wants to wait and see what happens and maybe I will be surprise and find a life worth living on the other side. The problem is I'm so god damn tired now. Referencing Tolkien's work.. ""I feel like butter spread over too much bread"". And every day that goes by the sweat call of all this ending is enveloping me. It's almost like I'm already dead and my soul is halfway out but my body still clinging on to life reminding me of what I will never be.

What triggers me the most is seeing photos of children playing, young adults hanging out, at parties ect. I spent most of my childhood scared of the world so I never went out and experienced living. Seeing those photos are heavy reminder of what I never had.

My life can be understood as a building halfway through construction but the foundations weren't correctly laid. As time moves forward and the weight of life starts to push down on those foundations everything inevitably comes crashing down. Even if I become a women, I'll be a women that never had a childhood as a girl. An identity missing its core.

I'm ordering SN, I have found a source. Hopefully it gets through customs without getting flagged. I don't think I could deal with a welfare check. It will just end with me going to hospital again and that never helps.

For those who have taken the time to read this, thank you for hearing my truth. You're the only ones I trust with this before the end.

One might object that a person could commit suicide with her/his own hands, without needing assistance from others, but society sees suicides as mentally ill people who need medical assistance. And above all, the acquaintances of those who commit suicide do NOT want to deal with suicide aftermaths.

In short, society accepts that a person's life may be miserable or painful beyond the limit of human endurance, but does not accept that a person takes her/his life because her/his life is shit.

""The road to Hell is paved with good intentions."" in this case, the pro-life intentions. And since in democracy the majority wins, suicide will never be legal unless the majority opens their eyes and start thinking ""It's not my life, they can CTB if they want, I have no right to judge them or impose my point of view through Law.""",,,,,,,,,,

It seems logical to me but why not to most people :

1. Horrible things can happen that could put anyone in a state of unbearable pain beyond human endurance or extreme torture. : i don't know who won't agree that this is true. does anyone here? what would the normies say?

2. people would then need to be able to escape extreme torture. Yes or no? why shouldn't everyone have the right to move away from pain suffering and even more extreme pain and extreme suffering? everyone should. it's the most important right.

3. so companies and people shouldn't be restricted from selling methods that people can use to escape torture. for example companies could sell Nembutal, suicide kits, suicide booths, cyanide capsules etc . so if we lived in a free world and not prison as we do then I could purchase Nembutal for around $20 since i'm over 18. I could have nembutal and cyanide capsules in case things go really bad .
This is not the case . they made all these guaranteed suicide methods into crimes so we are prisoners.

4. they took away our right to escape extreme torture , unbearable pain, extreme suffering for no fucking reason except to control us and make us and keep us slaves an prisoners.
They made all guaranteed suicide methods into crimes . as they are about to ban SN in the evil U.S.

Die Methode die ich für mich gefunden habe (Exit Bag mit Stickstoff) eignet sich NICHT, wenn man etwas haben möchte, dass man mal eben so schnell umsetzten kann. Man muss wirklich klar bei Verstand sein, sich mit den technischen Gegebenheiten auseinandergesetzt haben und die entsprechenden Dinge kaufen (kosten insgesamt etwas über 300 Euro).

Da es eine ausführliche Beschreibung auf deutsch gibt, hänge ich diese einfach mal hier als pdf an.

Ich übernehme keinerlei Verantwortung für die Richtigkeit der Beschreibung(en) und bin nicht verantwortlich für die, die die Absicht haben es nachahmen zu wollen. Auch ich habe die Informationen aus Quellen sammeln müssen und verlasse mich auf das was dort steht, jedoch - jeder und jede ist selbst dafür verantwortlich was er tut !!!

Da ich auch medizinische Berichte über Erfolge mit dieser Methode gelesen habe, gehe ich davon aus, dass es ein relativ sicherer und sanfter Tod ist sofern man sich an die technischen Gegebenheiten und Schritte die beschrieben werden auch strikt hält.

Ich habe mich für reinen Stickstoff (über 99,99% Reinheit) statt Helium entschieden, da es immer mehr Hersteller gibt, die Helium mit anderen Gasen mischen und die Methode dann nicht funktioniert!",,,,,,,,,,

Das Problem ist echt die richtige Konzentration zu erreichen. Ich hatte die damals hoch genug um bewusstlos zu werden aber nicht bewusstlos zu bleiben. War dann ein Zustand den ich meinem wünsche. Auch ist es recht aufwändig- man muss erstmam draußen einen Grill anzünden den man rein bringt oder einen Stromgenerator haben bei dem man weiß dass er für die Raumgröße genügend CO produziert ohne dass die Konzentration wieder abfällt, weil etwas Schwund ist fast immer.

Kohlenmonoxid ist im Grunde wie Exit Bag - man bedient sich Hypoxie/Anoxie - also dem Verlust von Sauerstoffversorgung für den Körper. Bei Kohlenmonoxid geht es nur eben langsamer. Das CO muss ins Blut und Blutkörperchen vom Sauerstofftransport abblocken.
Und da man eben nicht weiß wie hoch die Konzentration ist kann das schon mal dauern und einem ist übel, schwindelig...
Bei reinem Stickstoff hat man gleich sofort keinen Sauerstoff mehr und ist nach 15 bis 40 Sekunden bewusstlos. Während der 15 bis 40 Sekunden hat man bei sauberer Ausführung (siehe pdf) auch keine erstickungsgefühle. Stickstoff ist ein Gas das wir ohnehin die ganze Zeit einatmen weil unsere Luft die wir in diesem Moment atmen zu 79% aus Stickstoff und nur zu 21% aus Sauerstoff besteht. Das pure stickstoff bewirkt lediglich dass die 21% Sauerstoff eliminiert werden wozu man eben die Tüte braucht um einen Raum zu schaffen indem das möglich ist. Da der Körper auf die CO2 rückatmung nicht jedoch auf sauerstoffverlust mit erstickungsgefühlen reagiert bleibt das erstickungsgefpjl aus - man kann ja das CO2 weiter ausatmen bis die Atmung irgendwann mit dem Tod aussetzt wobei man aber längst bewusstlos ist.

Also die Kohlenmonoxid Methode geht bestimmt auch irgendwie und es hat auch bei vielen geklappt. Ich bin einer von denen bei denen es schief ging und deswegen weiß ich wie schwierig es ist die Konzentration einzuschätzen. eben Beim Exit Bag mit purem Gas und dem in deranleitung beschriebenen flowmeter für die durchlaufgeschwindigkeit kann man alles von Anfang an richtig einstellen.",1083267,,,,,,,,,

Zwar reicht bei CO ein luftanteil von nur 1-1,5% aber das muss man erstmal so schnell hergestellt bekommen und halten können.
Wenn man das nicht hinbekommt leidet man sehr unter den Symptomen des Sauerstoffmangels ohne Bewusstlosigkeit. Wenn die Konzentration wieder abfällt kann es sein dass man mit Hirnschäden und amputationen überlebt.
Und man hat immer die Situation dass man einen Raum braucht in dessen nebenräumen niemand anders ist - auch nicht über oder unter einem weil man die sonst gefährdet. Idealerweise geht es nur in einer abgeschiedenen einsamen Hütte die man erstmal haben muss oder ein luftdicht/gasdicht abgeschottetes Zelt für das man in der derzeitigen Lage Probleme bekommt wenn man es aufstellt und draußen grillt .

Also mit exit bag ist es einfach alles viel genauer messbar und ich denke, dass wenn ich mich an alles halte was dafür wichtig ist auch klappen sollte.
Auch muss ich nicht vor der Durchführung noch reisen und Aufwand mit Grill veranstalten. Ich bereite vorher alles so vor und bin mit allem dann so vertraut dass ich es jederzeit hervorholen und umsetzen kann es ich meine dass der richtige Zeitpunkt gekommen ist.



P.s.: wenn ich beim exit bag auf Reinheit und die richtige Menge und den richtigen Flow achte, wofür ich den regulator habe der mir das anzeigt, dann frage ich mich was überhaupt noch schief gehen kann?

The first lady I spoke to at least sounded gentle and sympathetic. The second just sounded irritated. She tried all sorts of tactics I really didn't appreciate: 'Think of what it would do to your family.' Well erm yeah- that's why I'm still stuck here after 34 years of ideation. 'Then of course- there's the issue if mental capacity.' That frightened me to be honest. I suspect they do have the power to suggest sectioning. Then, she asked me to promise that I would call them before taking the SN. I just replied that I knew their number now if I felt the need for their support in future. But I mean- why would you call them if you knew you wanted to attempt and succeed?!!

I just found it weird to be honest. Even the first lady I spoke to said: 'Don't you think we should talk about these intrusive thoughts you've been having?' But it's like- they're not intrusive. I've had them the vast majority of my life! I find it bizarre that a 'service' that must deal with suicidal people of all varieties day in, day out had such stereotyped notions of them. Just being on here, it's obvious to me that people experience ideation in their own unique way. I don't think it helps to just assume things about people.

Also, a colleague once rang them and said they only really wanted to ascertain whether she had a plan she was able to carry out- so, whether she was at immediate risk. When they found out she wasn't, they seemed to lose interest!

I guess my view kind of depends on whether they are voluntary for a start. If they are, I do think that's such a generous thing to do. Maybe it's unfair to expect too much of them.

Really though, they are set up to prevent suicide- like the rest of society. I don't think people should be all that surprised if they take a pro-life approach or, if they do all in their power to prevent a suicide- including involving police. They aren't likely to be respecting of the choice to do it. I suppose they'll assume the person is at least of two minds about doing it- at least in that moment. Otherwise, why would they have rung them?

I wonder if they do ever refer people on to other services that might help them longer term. That to me would seem useful.",,,,,,,,,,

Sadly that was very much a one term thing. Usually it's made no difference, or made it even worse. I think the issue often is that you're actually not getting human connection when you call; in my experience you most often get someone who reads from a script and it's easy to tell if someone is doing that or if they're being genuine. The former feels quite... insulting, to be honest. Like speaking to an AI, but worse because you know it's a human. The cop thing is disturbing. They're not allowed to do that here, but I'd never, ever dare to call if they could.",2677911,,,,,,,,,

Right off the bat, one of the very first things that I was asked was if I was going to commit suicide that evening.

When I said no and just really needed someone to talk to, and I told the guy that I had no family nor friends as a support system. and he seemed as interested in helping me as please hang the phone up.

He was TERRIBLE. I REALLY needed to be able to talk to someone to sort so much out and I got the bums rush of no immediate plans of killing myself, then please go away.

I never felt so demoralized before ever.

I would NEVER EVER call one again.

That is where SaSu comes into play, as this site is far better than any damn 988 phone number here in the U.S.

I sure hope that other countries help is better than ours.

Hugs and smiles to everyone here always.

You are truly an awesome and fantastic person.

Helping others is one of the finest things that humans can do, and you are incredible.

Thank you for being you, as I wish I had been able when I really needed it to connect with you.

Have you ever talked to a suicide hotline?,2677968,ConfusedClouds,"Sep 22, 2024 at 3:11 AM","I tried, at a time where I was struggling with my actual therapist. Mainly to do with the infrequency of 50 mins once a week and thus impatience not knowing what to do if struggling while waiting for next session.

Used a text line as I freeze and lose my words speaking sometimes, but typing seems to come easier. Was super on edge and a bit panicky and twitchy and didn't know where to turn. But no direct plans. So just as I was starting to feel like the conversation was possibly going to help calm me down/I was starting to find words, she essentially said 'well thats our time up - I wish you the best - if you need us we are here 24/7, please text again'. I then got even more upset and on edge - kinda left me feeling even more trapped and alone and with nowhere to turn than nefore I tried calling/texting - even the 'crisis' resource cuts me off because my 'crisis' or my attempts at explaining my 'crisis' was not 'bad' enough - i.e. I was not about to ctb that minute.

Why is there such a gap in any options - why do you have to reach 'the point of no return' to be able to be considered for support/listened to - but by then its too late and you risk getting locked up/actions out of your control/against your will.

Seems super counter productive to tell me to start/text/call again where it would take another hour to try explaining where I am at just to be cut off again. Confirmed my incompetence in communication and left me with nowhere else to turn.",,,,,,,,,,
Have you ever talked to a suicide hotline?,2678102,JustAStory,"Sep 22, 2024 at 6:33 AM","Yes, and it was an extremely frustrating experience.

I was out of town and realized I was feeling suicidal; ran to my hotel room and called the hotline.
I was having a hard time speaking, and the lady just kept asking me to raise my voice and speak more clearly.

I ended up telling her there was no problem as I was in a safe place and with no means of harming myself and hang up.
I then recorded a voice note to myself and sent a message to a student I was advising for his MSc thesis and I believed I did a really poor work with in the last few months due to my instability.
We made a better plan for the upcoming two months and managed to do a nice job.

So, I could say, the hotline was completely useless and my next, almost subconscious thought was to plan something a bit forward in the future to bind me to a kind of ""oath"".

That was one of my lowest days, but the way it played out gave me a little time to reconsider; my immediate thought was that they have completely incompetent people on those hotlines, but I also thought the fact I called meant that I didn't really want to die; when I came back to my town I sought medical help and I recovered for a full 3 years.",,,,,,,,,,

I got told to eat a brownie, paint, go on a walk in the middle of the night as a young female, and other useless coping skills. Thrown in amongst a million meaningless platitudes like ""you're so strong for going through all of this"" and ""I'm glad you decided to reach out"" and ""that must be so hard"". I never left feeling any better, and the text lines take 15minutes-2hours to respond to your initial text and then each subsequent response is delayed by several minutes, so you're better off just calming yourself down from whatever crisis you're in at that point.

The only time I ever received actual help from one was when I texted for a panic attack where I wasn't even actually suicidal. I told them as such but they were amazing at helping me walk through how to calm down and then were able to set me up with some amazing resources for what caused my panic attack for future use.

Have you ever talked to a suicide hotline?,2678118,nihilistic_dragon,"Sep 22, 2024 at 7:17 AM","They have their place I think. For folks who are just being emotional and ""think"" they want to ctb. The hotline will talk them out. A friend of mine had an experience like that. He was just very young and emotional and stressed about school, and one night out of the blue he thought he would ctb.

For folks like most of us here they're absolutely useless. We are too determined. We've reached the point of no return.

Me personally - nobody will ever be able to argue me out of nihilism. I did try to talk to someone some years ago (not a hot line though). What ended up happening was that I smiled and lied that I wasn't ""feeling"" suicidal anymore, thanked the person, and went right back to planning my ctb :)

Congrats, you destroyed your parent's trust and you're traumatized by the ER. Nobody wins!

It's also falsely implied to be a support line, when, for the most part, if you talk for too long and you're not actively suicidial, the volunteer needs to hang you up, isolating you, because there's someone else to call.

I'll admit something here but back around 2018/2019 I did make another account, I admit it, I got warnings by the mods at the time Serge/Marquis. I'm sure Rain and other mods know this also. That's the only bad shit I've ever done on here and that's the whole truth.

Now somehow something had to have happened or someone got ahold of my information account while I was logged off. But now I got messages from a mod saying I made an alt account.

If this isn't about what happened back in 2018/2019, then it had to have been something recently related to my account.

I planned on not coming back here for numerous of reasons and I logged off for a week so far, but I came back here and logged in to finally disable my account since I never had the balls to do it before. But now that I have been accused of something I DID NOT do I'm not leaving until this gets settled or I get banned but screw this.

I've been a member of this fucking forum for 6 fucking years. Why would I jeopardize all that by making a pointless alt? And you know I don't care what the mods say or what kind of evidence they have. Cause I did not do it. I did not do it. I did not fucking do it. Period.

To the mods: Please make this public, show the evidence, cause I would love to see what evidence you have especially while I was recently logged out.

This bleeding heart's (waiting for the waves)

I suffered insomnia too, and it's the worst.

Thing with psychotropic prescription drugs is, they can deplete nutrients like amino acids, vitamins and minerals, which can be near impossible to recover from without supplementation.
They can also cause hormonal imbalances, and your average quack psychiatrist simply do not know anything about this.

I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to tell me to go fuck myself for suggesting things, but my conscience forces me to at least inform.

- AlloPregnenolone might get you sleeping more, immediately. It is a natural GABA agonist, brain protecting, stress reducing hormone.
Available at idealabsdc.com/lab . That is a gray market site. Legal for them to ship, likely illegal to buy/receive most places. DHL express shipping clears customs almost anywhere. Can't tell you how I know.

- Custom amino acid repletion is the most promising I know of for chronic insomnia like yours.
Could be other things like B vitamin deficiencies too,
""Antiepileptic drugs are one example of a medication class with a higher risk of nutrient deficiencies, possibly reducing absorption or increasing the excretion of vitamins. ""If patients are on long term Dilantin, Tegretol or Lyrica, they may need potential nutrient supplementation such as biotin, folic acid, vitamin D, or vitamin K,"" said Sandra Campbell, PharmD, and MSU Health Care Chief Pharmacist.
Nutrient depletion is an often overlooked side effect of some medications
Taking medication according to the prescribed dose, time, and frequency or medication adherence is an important part of managing overall health and chronic conditions.

Right after I realized that the next best option for the rest of my life was to CTB I figured I could do a little string budget backpacking trip involving a good bunch of developing countries in the Americas.

Call it depression, early dementia, or plain disappointment; but as I got more involved with the idea of CTB, such adventurous trip became less and less interesting for me to the point of canceling it all out.

One of the reasons for quitting this potential trip of last joy was remembing how my abusive upbringing made me make choices that got me into undesirable situations with undesirable results that ruined other trips I made in the past.

I seeked help (theraphists, books, videos), but I just could not find a way to overcome my vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities that can get you in big trouble should you stumble upon people in the streets, bus rides, boat rides, and hostels who pretend to be helpful, but just want a piece of you.

Having said that, should I win USD$20,000 playing lottery, since the cancelled trip required a budget of USD$10,000; I would definitely resume planning and doing my backpacking crusade, return home, and then CTB.

My favorite company with best ingredients and formulations is objectivenutrients. Others can work too, they are just best imo.

About treatment resistant depression:
1) When did it start?
2) Does any events make it more or less intense?
3) Do you know the number of adverse childhood experiences you have had (ACEs); in other words, can trauma or neglect be a cause?
Number and yes or no can suffice to answer if too personal, or simply skip answering.
4) Did it gradually get worse over a period of time?
5) What medications, therapy forms and perhaps lifestyle changes have been attempted?
6) Do any foods make it worse?
7) Any background with restrictive dieting, caloric deficit, malnutrition, over exercising?
8) Any other health issues, physical or mental?

Dying itself though- depends. Some people probably know very little about it- if they are lucky enough to go in their sleep or under heavy pain killers. I imagine that's like aneasthetic- if they are even awake, one moment they're here, the next they're gone.

I have a horrible feeling it can be distressful though. If we're feeling pain and fear. I doubt many suicides- asides from those using the proper drugs like N are all that peaceful. Again, probably comes down to luck and preparation. How long we're stuck here trying to die and what's happening to our body.

The actual moment of death or at least, losing consciousness I imagine will be like going under anaesthetic or falling asleep. I sort of doubt it's anything prolonged but then, who knows?

There was an unfortunate patient who happened to die whilst they were having a brain scan I read about once. The areas of the brain associated with memory apparently lit up- which would support people claiming their life flashed before their eyes. Maybe the brain is flooded with all sorts of chemicals we don't get day to day. That in my unlearned opinion could be a reason for things like NDE's.

Death is non-existence forever : all problems solved instantly and forever. no chance of pain , suffering , diseases , problems , bad memories , diseaes ,old age , none of the 1000's of horrible things in life ever getting you .

While dying u are still alive so that has nothing to do with Death. In Death there can be no pain

if a gang is torturing a human like they tortured Junko Furuta ripping skin off fingers etc. they are suffreing dying . but if the human suddendly dies from one of the blows then that human is a corpse. they can continue to cut the corpse but it will feel no pain. That's the difference while dying torture cause still alive . While Dead no pain ever.

dying can be unbearable painful as in cancer , dementia and can take years of constant pain or it can be quick 3-5 minutes go to sleep as in Nembutal. But there is a big difference between dying and Death. while dying you are still alive and so can suffer unending constant unbearable pain. some people have suffered many years with alsheimers for example. . Dying can also be 1 micro-seconds as in a shotgun blast to the head. you go instantly unconscious after pulling the trigger. years in cancer pain vs 1 micro-second no pain. i'd take the shotgun. humans have a 40% chance of cancer in their lifetime and that is just one hell. cancer is unstoppable. no one knows that a human is really 30 trillion cells and each one of those is constantly copying DNA and duplicating . the machinery evolved to be very efficient but still the law of Entropy will always win and there will be mistakes in all this copying and that leads to cancer. The law of Entropy can never be overcome


we all will die anyway . so we are all dying , all decaying , we are all terminal . so it's the utlimate hypocrasy that the evil controllers tell us that they will allow us suicide only if you have a terminal illness which they arbitraliy define as being 6 months diagonosis by one their experts which are sometimes wrong on the exact date of Death. This they allow only in a few places . but we are all terminal 6 months to Death doesn't change that you will die anyway no matter what .

The pphb says to take 800mg of taganet 30 minutes prior if this is unavailable to me would another H2 Blocker such as ranitidine work ?

Tagamet is not an antiemetic. As far as I know its only used to reduce your stomach's acidity so the SN works better.

My issue is I chose a school I can't drive too so I usually drive to a park and ride then take a bus.

It sucks cause the bus only runs certain hours a day. Everything was good but then they started construction on the road up to my bus and accidents keep occurring in my shitty ass suburb where there's only one exit. So I've missed my bus twice now Eben though I'm doing what I've always done and it's making me so upset.

Like I chose the latest bust so I don't have to wake up or leave early and now I have to do that because of the mlst useless constriction ever and the worst part is they only work on it in the morning. When I'm coming back home they're nowhere to be found but when I need to go somewhere on time they're wasting everyone's time by turning a 20 minute drive into a 30 minute one.

Today I lost 6 minutes in traffic alone for no fucking reason and missed my bus


Now. I'm so pissed I literally want to drive my car into a building and kill myself. Like I had to park the car and just type thos so I could let out my frustration. I know this is a stupid reason to kill myself but im just tired of things not going my way. And when I complain about it ppl are like why don't you just leave earlier but it's like I don't get it why should I leave 40 minutes early for a 20 minute drive!! Like that's just 20 minutes of my day wasted.

This is why I hate leaving my house. If I don't kill myself before I graduate I'm never leaving my house again. I can't stand all these quick time events.

Like why the hell does the bus only run from 6 to 8 there are more ppl in this fucking area than 9 to 5 workers",,,,,,,,,,

,2667225,Bubble4246,"Sep 12, 2024 at 6:43 AM","Hey everyone,

I'm 24 and have been living with severe BPD and depression since I was a teenager. Suicidal thoughts have been a constant part of my life. I'm not really looking for advice on my mental health. I've been in therapy for years, which has helped me grow as a person, but the deep depression and thoughts haven't gone away. Medications haven't worked for me either and I've tried pretty much everything. I've accomplished a lot in life, but the one thing I feel I have left to control is my own death. I'm tired of the never-ending cycle of extreme highs and lows, and I've come to terms with the fact that even if I ""cure"" my BPD, those cycles won't stop. I'm sick of being tricked into happiness by this cruel life.

I've been thinking a lot about death recently, and I've realized it doesn't scare me anymore. The universe doesn't care about us, and everything is random. There is no such thing as a soul. The only thing I'm truly afraid of is the process of dying itself - the fear of messing it up and ending up severely brain-damaged, trapped in a life I don't want to live.

That's why I'm posting here. I've tried to take my life before, but those attempts weren't well planned. Now, after years of thinking about it, I've developed a plan. I just need some opinions on whether it's well-thought-out, especially regarding dosages and possible complications.

Please note, I'm not sure if I'll actually go through with it. I just want to have an open, non-judgmental discussion about my plan and get some feedback. My plan is to take the following in quick succession: 150 mg Zopiclone, 75 mg Oxazepam, 20 mg Clonazepam, and finish by smoking 200 mg of Heroin. I don't have any tolerance to these drugs. The idea is that I would remain coherent long enough to smoke the heroin, and within 5-10 minutes, the effects of the benzos and heroin should kick in, making me go unconscious quickly and painlessly. Hopefully the euphoria of the heroin would make me not aware of anything else, and fall into a deep and comfortable sleep.

I'm concerned about a few things, though. Could this be painful? Is the dosage enough? Have I thought everything out correctly? Also, how high is the risk of vomiting everything out? Is there anything else I haven't thought about?

In general benzos won't get you there dependably. With opioids you will go if you take enough but you need to be somewhere you won't be found for a while as with opioids you can be revived.
There's a risk of vomiting too which may waste your attempt. I hope you start feeling better & that you find peace, whatever choices you make",,,,,,,,,,

,2668718,Bubble4246,"Sep 13, 2024 at 12:27 PM","Update: Just smoked heroin for the third time and realized I have no idea how I'm supposed to smoke 200 mg of it. The most I've done so far is 18 mg (mainly because I'm scared of overdosing before I'm ready), and that already hits super hard. It kicks in within 10-20 seconds and gets really intense after a minute or two. By the peak, around 20 minutes in, I was sweating like crazy and felt so nauseous I almost threw up. I had to focus on my breathing for ten minutes while sitting to calm down. It's a horrible experience.

I've read that it could be because I don't have any tolerance, so the negative effects are more pronounced. The probability of vomiting seems extremely high, so I'll have to experiment with promethazine and see if that helps.

I feel like even if I could load 200 mg into my vape, I'd only manage one hit before collapsing, probably only getting about 25% of the dose. My heroin might also be cut because I'm still anxious and not euphoric at all like I thought I'd be. I don't get the hype. Maybe I just don't like opiates? All the negative effects are just making my anxiety worse. Why isn't this stuff as amazing or addictive as people say? The reviews from where I got it were super positive.

Smoking or snorting is not reliable enough.

Your body is probably aborbing around 50-55% of the heroin when smoked (assuming perfect technique, which you don't have).

Snorting, your body is probably absorbing around 60% of the heroin.

IV, 100% of the heroin will enter your bloodstream (you know, what with you actively injecting it into a vein and that).
100% of the heroin will enter you bloodstream, and all at once.

_

As an addict, please never experiment with taking heroin again.

If you continue smoking it, you will begin to like it. It is impossible not to. You are literally flooding your brain with dopamine.

Flush the heroin down the toilet now, or you will, eventually, regret not doing so.
Be this in months, or years.


If this is really your chosen method to CTB, rebuy the heroin when it is your time to go.

Practice IVing without the heroin.

I want you to know that I truly appreciate everything you guys share, and I've been taking all of your advice to heart. With each passing day, I feel more certain about my decision to CTB, which is why I'm so frustrated that the heroin I obtained seems to be cut, as there's been pretty much no euphoria. I'm still holding out hope that boofing might make a difference. All I want is a euphoric and peaceful end, but so far, I've been let down. I've tried smoking higher doses (highest so far 28 mg), but the experience has been equally disappointing. The only positive is how much it speeds up time, 30 minutes can feel like 10.

I've also noticed that taking promethazine about 30-45 minutes before taking the H really helps with the nausea, which is helpful, but the high itself is far from what I expected. Weed still feels more euphoric by comparison.

Whatever happens next, I'll keep you updated. I hope to obtain a syringe within a few days to try boofing. IV is not really an option for me. I tried last year but couldn't get it to work, finding a vein and so on, and I'm very afraid of needles. I also need to consider the fact that I'll be on an extremely high dose of benzos during my attempt, so I'm on a time limit before they kick in and make it impossible for me to administer the heroin. Boofing seems like it might be the best option. I could get comfortable in bed, listen to some calming music, and pass peacefully as everything hits and I fall into a deep sleep... It sounds nice.

As I built tolerance, after a week and a half of daily consumption, the nausea went away. If you felt sick, you took too much. Despite the nausea, I liked it. But never use opioids daily.

The extreme discomfort of feeling like you need to go to the bathroom is really annoying and makes the technique hard to get through. I was expecting to boof, then relax in bed, but now I'll likely have discomfort while I CTB. Oh well... I just need to get this down and see if it works.

It also seems like I've built a tolerance to heroin, which is just great ugh. I'm not experiencing physical withdrawals or anything, just a tolerance. So, I'll probably take a week off and keep practicing boofing with just water and a little acid to get used to the feeling. I think the strategy regarding the heroin might be to boof as much of it as I can, and then afterwards smoke more to knock me out. Just gotta make sure I won't leak it out after I've smoked it.

Since I've done heroin multiple times now, and even built a little tolerance to it. I can finally say that it does feel nice, still not as nice as weed but whatever. I kinda pretended that I was drifting to sleep and death earlier when I smoked 55 mg throughout one hour. It was so incredibly nice... I can totally see myself falling into a deep sleep with a smile on my face during the actual attempt.

It seems like the citric acid I use to dissolve heroin is the only thing causing issues when I boof. I remember the first time I tried there was no discomfort, but later attempts were much worse - probably because I used way more acid. I'm going to try reducing the amount of acid and see if that helps. However, I'm taking a few days break from heroin now to reduce tolerance.

I'll keep you all updated.",,,,,,,,,,
,2677109,Bubble4246,"Sep 21, 2024 at 9:38 AM","Another small update: After a few days without heroin, I decided to try boofing it again, this time using ascorbic acid (vitamin C). I must say, the discomfort is practically gone now, and I feel the effects much better since I've learned to dissolve it properly. Ascorbic acid with a bit of heat works much better than citric acid only. I tried 40 mg this time, and while the high wasn't as intense as when I smoked 18 mg before (probably due to some tolerance now), it did last around 6+ hours. It actually wasn't even nausea inducing which makes me hopeful! I can easily dose a whole gram of this stuff and get the job done now compared to smoking.

I think this might be the way for me to achieve a heroin + benzo overdose when I decide to ctb. It gives me enough time to get comfortable in bed, relax, listen to peaceful music, and spend time with my cat. I genuinely feel happy with this discovery. I'm not sure when exactly I will ctb, but right now, it feels like it could happen sometime in early October. However, I also find comfort in knowing that it doesn't have to be today - it can always wait until tomorrow, as that's an action that can't be undone.

As always, thank you for reading, and I'll continue to keep you guys updated on my journey.",,,,,,,,,,
,2679874,Bubble4246,"Sep 23, 2024 at 8:11 AM","As time keeps moving forward, I've realized more than ever that I want to ctb. I think I've decided that this week will be my last. I'll make sure to have a nice shower, order some good food, and then go out with a well-thought-out plan. Now that I understand how to administer the heroin, I believe over a gram should be enough. Combined with a high dose of benzos, it should be painless, and I'll finally drift into the deep sleep I've longed for these past few years. I won't have to wake up and feel that sense of disappointment about facing another day. I'll update you guys with the exact details of my plan later.

I've ordered more heroin and some Xanax, which should arrive by Thursday at the latest, and that's when I'll end things. Strangely, my mood has lifted since making this decision; there's a sense of relief in knowing that I'll soon be able to rest forever, free from these endless, painful cycles of life. All that remains is to finalize some notes and leave a few things behind for the people I care about. Once that's done, I'll be ready to cross over to the other side.

Thank you all again for listening to my story. I'll keep you updated.",,,,,,,,,,

8/30/24

This Wednesday, August 28 2024, I met the team that will be overseeing my treatment. They were very kind and walked me through every step of my journey that I'm about to embark on.

The plan as of now is to have the tumor surgically removed in the next 2 months, then go through rounds of chemo until my cancer enters remission. The good news is, though my tumor has grown through the wall of my colon (as seen on my scans), it doesn't seem to have metastasized yet. They didn't give any % of survival or anything, but they told me it's very likely I will survive this. I still have a young and strong immune system. I've been prescribed some pre-op medications to try to slow the growth of my tumor and control it before it is removed. I went through some other tests, blood, stool, etc... (It was a very long visit to the hospital, to say the least). I did get tested for Lynch syndrome thanks to you guys! (I'm very thankful for all the input you guys have given me <3). I should the test results back in about 5-7 days, so I'll keep you all updated.

As for my emotional and mental state, I've definitely noticed a decline. I moved back in with my parents this week and everyone just seems so down. I understand it. If my son got cancer I wouldn't even know how to feel. They're trying to keep me happy, but it's not really working lol. I've never been ""happy"" and I doubt I ever will. There were days this week when I didn't even get out of bed until 2 pm.

My university knows of my diagnosis, and they are trying their best to cater to my new life. I'm a music education major, which is not an easy degree to earn online. My lesson teacher said she cried when I sent her an email informing her. I really do love my school. I took this week off, except for some of my online assignments. I think I'm gonna try to go for at least 3 days next week, the least I can do is try right? The meds are making me very drowsy though :(

I'm here for any suggestions or comments or anything lol. I love you guys.",,,,,,,,,,

Two cups, 25g each, surely I won't vomit enough for not enough SN to be absorbed?

SN and Benzos no issue. Will probably use a prescription painkiller too.",,,,,,,,,,
,2679679,Agon321,"Sep 23, 2024 at 3:45 AM","There are cases of people who have drunk only SN and probably succeeded.
Even a few grams of SN can be fatal, so for this reason, anyone should not test SN if they do not want to die.

Antiemetics are highly recommended, but they are not completely necessary.

It is very important in the whole process not to vomit, or to vomit as late as possible. Antiemetics are to help with this.
The more and faster SN is absorbed by the body, the better.
However, even taking antiemetics does not guarantee that the person will not vomit. It is a bit of a lottery.
Also, if the person vomit, it does not automatically mean failure.
Such a person can still die.

So it is possible to succeed without antiemetics, but CTB can be less pleasant and the probability of success decreases.
It is hard for me to say how much the chance of success is lower.

You definitely have to mentally prepare yourself for vomiting.
It is better to prepare for the worst-case scenario.
Fasting and a few glasses of SN increase the margin of error.

Make your own responsible decision.
Good luck.",,,,,,,,,,

,2669857,paredler,"Sep 14, 2024 at 1:19 PM","I am empathetic towards this kind of philosophy, and I am a pessimist and I do encourage critical thinking when it comes to dogmas and social norms in general and having children in particular. However, antinatalism, as a philosophy, has some serious holes it doesn't address, and has some contradictions I can't just put up with.

I'll start by saying that antinatalism is a retrospective philosophy. It says ""I shouldn't have been born"" but it doesn't offer any solutions to what to do once you are born. Many, if not most antinatalists, are against the right to die, which I think is not only cowardly, but also contradicting and hypocritical. I think antinatalists should shift their focus from antinatalism to right to die philosophy, because I think those who do exist and are suffering are more important than potential people.

The premise of antinatalists is that everyone hates being alive. While it's true that most people are destitute, come from abusive households, are rape victims, suffer from some kind of disability or chronic illness, suffer from some sort of PTSD, have been homeless once in their lifetime, which means their lives are objectively bad, they, for some reason, don't regret being born and are actually against the right to die because they hope for a better future. Their hope is not necessarily rational, but they still genuinly want to be here. My point is, juat because antinatalists hate their lives doesn't mean everyone else does, even if their lives are objectively bad and hating your life is the only rational response.

The third reason is the gamble argument. It's true that having a child is a gamble, but since you don't know the future of that child, natalists can rightfully conclude that the child is going to have a fine future and antinatalists can't really prove that wrong. They can only say ""you don't know your child's future, so he might as well be miserable"", but none of the sides wins the argument. Natalists would prefer to give a chance while AN's would rather avoid potential harm.

The fourth reason is antinatalists obsession with people who adopt children. According to them, a parent who gave birth to a child, despite being a supportive parents, both financially and mentally, who planned everything and thought about everything and is prepared for whatever that comes at his child's way, he's still an asshole compared to a someone who adopted his child, despite this adoptive parent can be abusive, dysfunctional, kicking the child out of home at 18 and not give a damn about his well being. Most people who adopt are racist. How do I know that? Because there are long lines of people who want to adopt a white, blonde hair blue eyed child from eastern europe, but almost zero parents who want to adopt black children from Africa. Also, there's this case of that asshole singer, Tim Lambesis, who adopted three children from ethiopia and he was very neglectful towards them.

All in all, having been to the AN subreddit, I have mostly encountered people who just screamed words and weren't interested in engaging a thoughtful discussion about the philosophy, about what works and what doesn't. Many, if not most, users on this subreddit were just NPC's who didn't have anything meaningful to add to the discussion.

I am not an antinatalist, but a conditional natalist. I think that having a child IN POVERTY is immoral, because that's a prison sentence for the child. You already know your child's future is going to be bleak, he's going to suffer a lot, he's going to be targeted for humiliation and harassment. It's irresponsible to have a child in poverty, because that child joins to the cruel journey of your own life of poverty and after you're gone he's just going to have it worse. I know too many cases of people.coming from poverty who have had terrible lives and aren't able to escape the very undesirBle fate of poverty.",,,,,,,,,,
,2669906,Forever Sleep,"Sep 14, 2024 at 2:18 PM","I'd say one of the main reasons I have antinatalist views is because we don't have a 'right to die.' If assisted suicide was permitted for more people (strictly regulated of course to make sure people aren't doing it impulsively, or while they're psychotic, or being coerced- murdered,) then, I'd possibly feel differently.

Attitudes towards suicide would have to change too. None of this- it's selfish, you can't do it to your family. No more emotional blackmail forcing people to stay here. It would need to be accepted that a person born here didn't get the choice so- they get to make that choice when they are able to understand it.

But- when is that ever going to happen?!! I doubt assisted suicide will ever be available to (relatively) healthy people who simply don't want to be here. We'll continue to be born into wage slavery and not allowed to leave until officials decide we're too old and ill to contribute anymore. Parents aren't suddenly going to be ok with their children wanting to die.

So realistically, for the worse case scenarios, we're still being born into a hostage scenario! And it's not always that easy to predict. Some people even here will openly admit their lives aren't objectively terrible but they still feel terrible enough to want to risk killing themselves. Personally, I don't think it's fair to expose a being to that risk.

Maybe once we see a world like that, ask antinatilists to reconsider their views but realistically- do you ever think we will see a world like that? Even if they all start campaigning now. All the while, babies are still being born into this.

Put it this way- would many parents be willing to obtain Nembutal for their children if they'd had enough? I doubt many would.",,,,,,,,,,

Plus, if you're unfortunate enough to get caught, there's the danger of getting a criminal record and ending up in the psyche ward. And those who supply end up going to jail. (eg. Kenneth Law who ran IC and sold SN and other suicide aides.)

Not sure why it's still ok to be brought into a situation that's so difficult to escape from. I guess the argument will be that the majority of people won't become suicidal. Not fabulous for those who do though! Personally, I still don't think it's worth exposing a non consenting being to the risk. But, I'm a pessimist!

Also- best case scenario- they do bring in assisted suicide for a larger demographic of people. I still expect the age limit will be 18+ unless there are extenuating circumstances. I actually do agree with that too. Still it means- if someone hates their life from early on, they still have 18 years to endure before they can even be considered. Or, they risk all the brutal and unreliable methods we're stuck with at the moment.

It also still won't change people's attitudes towards suicide. Families and parents will still put pressure on people to stay. Maybe it will work out in all their favour- maybe they will recover but, perhaps they won't too. Again, I wouldn't want to expose a child to that risk but that's also a personal fear that no child of mine would escape ending up unhappy (most likely.)",2671960,,,,,,,,,

,2679848,disabledlife,"Sep 23, 2024 at 7:40 AM","So basically being born into poverty is immoral (and I agree), but being born disabled (with parents who knew the risk) is moral? For what?

I think, and this is simply my opinion, a opinion of a person born incurably disabled, a progressive illness, full of suffering, worse and worse, which has no outcome but death in suffering, agony!

Being born disabled, sick, or becoming disabled, mistreated, etc., is much worse than poverty. There is trauma (case of violence, or abandonment if parents fail, for example). To be disabled, dwarf, ugly, sick, especially if it is incurable, or expensive if there are solutions, is to be condemned to a life much worse than poverty, considered a burden on society, rejected by everyone, put in an institute (or on the street if he doesn't have the means to pay!), be placed under guardianship, deprived of liberty, in addition to being deprived of autonomy, of an intellectual future, of good health, of traveling, deprived of sensory freedom, such as seeing well, visually admiring landscapes, listening to music, etc. Disability can deprive you of the freedom to find love, friends, start a family (a much worse kind of eugenics, called natural selection!) etc.

The worst thing is that if the child is aware of his suffering, especially if it is incurable, and even progressive, ending in agony, etc., it is a form of torture. Again this is my opinion. I say this because it jumps out at me, it's perfectly obvious.

Personally, I would never want to see this happen to children who have not asked for it, especially from parents who know what they are going to do.

You should know that there are countries, schools, professions, clubs, diplomas, visas, stores, etc., which are completely closed to disabled people, and that the world is essentially inaccessible to disabled people (sidewalks, access to care, transport, driving license, financial access, adapted schools, administrations, bank loans, bank accounts, financial investments, marriage, etc.). This is even the case in France for example for many prohibitions and inaccessibilities!

In addition, foreign disabled people are prohibited from traveling to Canada and Australia, because they are considered excessive burden!
You should know that there are countries, schools, jobs, clubs, diplomas, visas, stores, etc., that are totally forbidden to the disabled, and that the world is essentially inaccessible to the disabled (sidewalks, access to care, transportation, driving licenses, financial access, adapted schools, administrations, bank loans, bank accounts, financial investments, marriage, etc.). This is even the case in France for example for many prohibitions and inaccessibilities!

There are even still countries that authorize torture on disabled people, ugly, with rare diseases, albinos, too much hair, deformations, etc. Some believe in witchcraft, in 2024! There are still, in this world, disabled people chained and put in cages, by their own parents. And even, without going to extremes, many disabled people, if they are placed under guardianship, or placed in institutions, interned in psychiatric hospitals, are there for life! They are mistreated, sedated, robbed of their property, their money is stolen by their institutions, and even by their own parents! I have seen it, I have witnessed it!

Being ugly deprives you of access to careers as misses, models, etc.

Being small in height deprives you of military careers (the guards who protect the South Korean border, facing North Korea, must be at least 1m77), of security, of the possibility of driving certain vehicles, of access to sports requiring height or strength such as basketball or rugby, to name a few examples. Little ones are paid much less, are infantilized, despised, looked down upon, etc., it is a scientific observation (see the sources below, 2 examples, but there are an infinite number). Moreover, being a dwarf deprives one of the possibility of sitting at normal chairs, eating at normal tables, riding a bike, etc.

Being mentally retarded deprives one of access to professions requiring higher education, and even to certain professions that are nevertheless easy to access (example, secretary).

Being color blind deprives one of access to many artistic professions in engineering, railway, driving.

Being in a wheelchair, or even on a cane, crutch, walker, deprives one of access to most housing (stairs, narrow doors, switches that are too high, inaccessible taps, inaccessible kitchen), streets, cities, transportation, especially in less advanced or poor countries!

These professional deprivations lead to deprivations of access to social and financial status, respect from others, etc.

,2679729,Praying 4 a Miracle,"Sep 23, 2024 at 5:08 AM","It's petty clear that the majority of people on Earth (the healthy and happy) simply do not understand what real suffering is, and do not support those who are. This needs to change ASAP. These same people would never even think of allowing an animal (domestic pet, in the wild, or even livestock) to suffer needlessly, and yet they believe a human being should be forced and expected to, often for decades. It's beyond cruel, it's inhumane insanity on a worldwide scale.

Personally, I believe that every adult on Earth should have the right, and access, to safe and humane assisted suicide if THEY feel they have no other solutions. This would likely result in FEWER people committing suicide, because of the much higher level of peace-of-mind that this would create.

People would know they'd have a safe and peaceful escape hatch if it ever becomes absolutely necessary (in their mind, not doctors and those who currently have all the power) to end their suffering. Like others have said in posts on this forum, this should be our most important basic human right. This barbaric problem that so many in this world are facing will not last forever (the masses will eventually come to their senses), but we need to (dramatically) speed this up.

When I read some of the posts, it just breaks my heart that so many have to resort to all of these painful, risky, and inhumane methods to relieve their suffering, and it just does not have to be this way. I'm actually very new to this way of thinking, and have spent 57 years feeling extremely healthy and happy myself, so I know exactly how these people feel.

Many have children of their own, and would be absolutely devastated if they were to lose a loved one. My parents would be devastated, and they're both in their 80's. This does not change the fact that human beings should not be forced to suffer needlessly, and have to resort to dangerous, painful, and most often brutal methods of unassisted suicide to escape their unrelentingly pain.

A little background on my personal life is that I'm a retired engineer and business owner,
am married, and have three (currently happy and healthy) children. By most people's standards I've had a very blessed and charmed life for almost 6 decades. Now, since my health issues began just over 2 years ago, things have gone south rather quickly. I'm living proof that things can change in a heartbeat, and it can happen to anyone.

This forum is a MASSIVE support and help to those who are suffering the most in this world. It's pretty obvious that not everyone feels the same way. In my somewhat unique situation, it's more than obvious that this forum is helping people immensely, and yet so many in this world simply cannot see it, yet.

I honestly believe this is about to change however, and very quickly. As far as I can.tell, this is the ONLY forum or major website ON EARTH that is very effectively and successfully tackling what is arguably the most important and controversial issue in existence.

Yes,, suicide is a nasty business, but ignoring those in the world who are suicidal only makes things much much worse. There needs to be discussion and support. Without it, there is just ignorance and stigmatization. The proof is that suicide is the number one cause of death in people under 35 worldwide, (with men it's number one under the age of 50!). Clearly what the world is doing now is not working.

The barbaric, non-supportive, dangerous policies of forcing people to do these things on their own must stop. No one, no matter how humane assisted suicide becomes, is going to want to die prematurely if they are not truly suffering, especially after trying all other solutions possible to remedy the problem(s). There obviously should be age limits and a reasonable waiting period, to eliminate the chance of impulsive decisions, but they should be the only restrictions. Also, precautions should be taken to ensure that no one is ever coerced into making this decision (especially the elderly).

If those with thoughts of suicide feel supported and loved, the chances of them actually committing suicide go way down. This is obviously why this forum and community is doing so much good in the world. Yes, it is going to seem gory and evil to some, but it's NOT being glamorized AT ALL.

In fact, the more posts I read, the more I'm realizing just how dangerous, painful, scary, and uncomfortable it really is. It's actually a huge deterrent, and yet oddly comforting at the same time. Probably because of the feeling of support and community (we know we're not alone in this), but also because at least there is, if absolutely necessary, an escape from all of the pain and suffering.

One common dominator between most sucides is not SS or SN, but instead the person CTBing not telling anyone before they do it. But from SS we know there's that wish that people have a way to communicate how they feel and their desires.

What stops people from communicating to loved ones is how we treat MH. The threat of being locked up is obviously going prevent people doing this.

Addiotbslly how we speak to people suffering, their either treated like kids, or hotlines like the Samaritans are too protective with what they say that they don't offer anything meaningful - and feels hollow.

If similiar to what you said we made CTB accessible and non judgemental people would suddenly feel alot more capable to talk to loved ones about what they are going through and their desires. Like on SS these interactions can absolultoey save lives, and I imagine many many more than locking someone up for a few months - until they get out and CTB anyway.

I have struggled with depression in the distant past & never reached the point of suicide. Not even close. I am not at all depressed now or in the last year or however long it's been. Two years. Three??? I can't remember. I'm old. And yet, here I am, hailing a bus that I never thought I'd hail.
Life circumstances change & change quickly & often can't be reversed & that is that.
Not everyone understands that.
I've had to deal with a great deal of mental gymnastics since joining this site - I have lost many people to suicide in my life, I occasionally viewed this as selfish, I always viewed it as someone just missing that last step that could have saved them, that they just couldn't see for themselves. I tried to save people. I'm Australian & old, I thought Philip Nitschke was a crazy person back in the day, I'm not gonna lie. And then you get some particular life experiences that just change your mind. I've watched countless family members die slow, painful, agonising & inhumane deaths. I've watched animals put to sleep with such grace. I'm so grateful that the tide is turning for the terminally ill & that that's a start. I wish I could go back in time & offer that assistance to family members who I have no doubt would've made that choice for themselves if given that option. I've really struggled here on SaSu, watching such lovely beautiful people choosing the bus I'm choosing - I've wanted them to succeed, been pleased that they've succeeded, & still grieved their loss in this world & wish they'd found another way. Not everyone has another way. I don't have another way. I just wanted to share really openly all the things I believed to be true - that there's always more options, that Philip Nitschke was insane, that I'd only get here via depression - it just goes to show that life & opinions & circumstances & progress, move on.

It took about three weeks to receive (a week longer than stated it would take) and no, there wasn't a welfare check or anything involved.

To say that I am overjoyed would be an understatement and if I hadn't ate earlier in the day I would very much consider using it this minute but alas, I still have a few loose ends to tie up before I can be content with my decision to CTB coming to fruition. Apparently, according to the site it was actually delivered yesterday evening but I was far too depressed to even get myself out of bed by that stage of the day to check as I tend to sleep for prolonged periods anymore.

I am very excited to finally have a close on this joke of an existence and am more than looking forward to nothingness or whatever else shall come to pass. My life has been filled to the brim with misery at every possible intersection and I'm honestly baffled that I'm even made it to 35. Everyone I had ever given a chance took advantage of my kindness and brought me to this point and I blame myself for not wishing to stoop to their varying levels of degeneracy to cope with it all. I can CTB knowing that I was as good of a person as humanly possible and know that it wasn't my fault for being pushed to this point.

No, I was not perfect but I came remarkably close, I never purposefully hurt or took advantage of others, I was always there to give advice to those who needed it, I loved deeply and with every fiber of my being, I fulfilled every obligation and debt I had ever made/accrued, and a plethora of other things. Sure, I was guilty by association at times while younger and sometimes I chose not to get involved when I should have either out of fear or ignorance and I did lie on occasion but not without valid reasons for doing so (losing my personal agency or facing legal trouble due to such) but I can go knowing that I did the best I could weathering the storm that humanity has created and even though I will be a casualty of such due to my own volition I am content with that and can be at peace knowing I won many battles but lost the war.

Because in the end we all lose and even those who are remarkably successful in this fictitious reality will be no better off in the end and possibly far worse as there are very few innocent souls who reach the upper echelons of the society we created and are forced to adhere to or be pushed aside.

This isn't a goodbye thread by any means as I still have some time left but I can safely say that I can finally see a port up ahead after weathering a storm for decades.

I ate at 4pm and would take my SN at ~1am, a nine-hour fast. It is now 19:20. (End of post: 8pm.)

Before I die, I will make payments of £1,000 to three of my friends who:

1) my family do not know well (and so are not named in my will)
2) I have bank details for
3) I have the ability to send a message on a delay (email/Telegram)

I will send suicide notes to those three and two others (both named in my will) on a delay, to arrive early tomorrow morning. That means they'll arrive when I'm dead, so they won't need to panic to try and save me.

I will leave a physical note for my parents, informing them what I have taken, to be careful around any spills (especially for the dogs), and that if they are calling an ambulance then the antidote is methylene blue. There is a longer digital note on my laptop for them; I will also tell them the code for my laptop.

My steps:
4pm: last meal (apple and raspberry sponge)
8pm: test dose of meto. Not expecting anything.
11pm: no more drinking until it is time to begin properly.
12am: Starting preparing my drinks of SN solution, 25g in 100ml x2 . Take 45mg mirtazapine in lieu of benzos - this is a tranquil using antidepressant I am prescribed.
12:15am: 30mg meto
1am: drink SN solution

Honestly, I don't feel especially bad, and I'm starting to get fed up of this place, but I don't actually think I'll get better. I have lost interest in my travel plans which were previously the only thing keeping me going. I think killing myself is the utility-maximising decision for myself. I'm going to do it in the future so may as well do it now.

Risks:
1) I change my mind - not the worst thing in the world.
2) meto interacts with mirtazapine and I am too confused or sedated to complete plan.
3) I disturb my parents and they call an ambulance. This is the worst outcome as it probably leads to a hospitalisation.
4) I forget that I'm supposed to be fasting and eat something.
5) the classic: I vomit it all up.

Will try to update if and when I take my SN, or if I abort my attempt.",,,,,,,,,,

I need to vent: I was reading an old story recently. One of the female side characters was stolen from her parents as a baby by a fairy, then was adopted by a duke and dutchess. The protagonist revealed to her, on her birthday, that her real parents were peasants, and even invited them without telling her. She assuming this was meant to humiliate her, and because she got upset by this, she was promptly disowned by her foster parents and her real parents. And of course, she was villanized by the story and whatever trauma she might have had was never really addressed. She was always portrayed as receiving no sympathy from others (except the protagonists, a couple, who basically just led her on as their third wheel for some reason).

I related to her the most. I wish I could go anywhere or do anything without being reminded of what people really think about me, that everyone only sees me as some crazy woman who hates everything and deserves to be miserable and alone. It's hard to enjoy anything or to love myself.",,,,,,,,,,

Women’s Space Peer Support Megathread,2607524,Ash,"Jul 24, 2024 at 3:51 AM","Due to sexual violence, I never had a successful one until having a hysterectomy but that was on me, not the smear test itself. The nurses all knew my history and were absolutely amazing but I just couldn't relax except for once.... I was so tense that I, well, for want if a better description, I spat out the speculum (plastic, not metal). The nurse was so surprised she burst out laughing and was full of praise for my pelvic floor muscles so I started laughing too. We calmed down, then tried again but I started laughing at the crucial moment and, well, it happened again.

We tried again the following month but my cervix was at the wrong angle (I didn't even know that was possible) and she didn't want to hurt me and then for various reasons that led to me having the hysterectomy, my cycle became so irregular we couldn't catch it at the right time.

But the process itself isn't violent.

There are some excellent gynaecologists on YouTube who do videos of exams (with their patients' consent) so you can see for yourself what it involves in real life rather than unhelpful illustrations.

My advice is to do your research, book an appointment to speak to the nurse who does the exams but just to talk, not to have it done (go when you're on your period if you need the defence).

Talk it through, touch the instruments, do the duck face thing with the speculum etc. Then book it for real and ask for a double appointment. If your don't like the nurse, all the receptionist to book another meet n greet style appointment with a different nurse and start again. You can take a friend who can go in with you or wait outside. Or you can ask for a chaperone. And you can tell them (not ask, tell) to stop at any point. You can pause and continue or end it altogether.

They are well aware of women's discomfort and embarrassment and horror at the invasive nature of the exam and will take it at your pace. My excellent nurse told me that she's seen it all (literally) and only cares if the woman has showered or at least washed recently. But when it's her turn, she panics about grooming and knicker lines and that pimple at the base of one of the hairs: they're all human.",2607104,,,,,,,,,

Also the whole ""you have to man up"" and ""men aren't allowed to show feelings"" is an ancient problem and I really wish our society wouldn't behave like this towards men.

In a different, but also similar kind of way I can relate to how painful it feels to be discriminated, belittled or not taken serious just because of your goddamn gender.

Much of my personal trauma roots from being female.
I've experienced sexual abuse in childhood, teenage and adult years.
There has been bad discrimination by ""friends"", teachers, even my own parents, just because I was born as a girl. They would never lose a chance to let me know.

Once someone told me that I'm not human, just a bag of female cells and that's why I would deserve to be violated and abused by him if he wanted to. He said that my mind isn't capable of feeling pain or thinking thoughts like men do and that I only exist to give him pleasure.

There have been enough men in my life that hurt me deeply.

But at the same time I met intelligent, decent, kind men. People and friends that always treated me with respect and were great human beings.

I've seen it both. Dark, gruesome souls with no regard for other people. And beautiful, bright minds in both, men and women.
It would never occur to me to say that all men are bad people.

I'm sorry for the times you had to listen to me cry all night.

I'm sorry for all the panic attacks you saw me have and for the times I pushed you away and shouted at you to leave me alone when you just wanted to comfort me.

I'm sorry for waking you up from your nap to hug you and seek comfort.

I'm so sorry for making you witness your mom covered in blood and hurting herself; I'm sorry for getting angry when you tried to take the blade from my hands with your little paw.

I'm sorry for making you hear me scream that I want to die.

I'm sorry for taking so long to figure out who to leave you with when I'm no longer in this world, even knowing that there is no one in this world you could love more than me, knowing that you distrust and fear any face that isn't mine.

I'm sorry for taking longer than I should to refill your food and water bowl; I don't want you to go hungry, but sometimes I can't move from the bed.

I'm sorry for going weeks without cleaning your litter box; we both hate the smell, I know. I'm sorry for getting angry when you go outside the box, knowing it's my fault for not cleaning it more often; I just don't have the energy.

I'm sorry for not having a clean room for you; I'm sorry you have to live in a dirty place that smells like cigarette smoke, Im sorry that you have to walk on my clothes scattered on the floor.

I'm sorry for not playing with you more often; I love watching you play and would love to spend more time together; but you have too much energy.

I'm sorry for not letting you socialize more with other cats; I would love to see you get along with them.

I'm sorry for not cooking you homemade food like I said I would; I don't have money even to feed myself.

I'm sorry for not being the best mom for you; I want you to know that you will always be the sweetest kitty in the world to me; you never did anything wrong, you don't deserve all this.

I love you with all my soul and being; I wish I could be better and not have to leave you alone and scared when I'm not with you. If the day ever comes when I'm not present, I hope you can be happy and well taken care of; I hope you can forgive me.

I see you lying on my legs while I write this, and it's as if you know what I'm thinking; lately, you don't want to leave me alone for even five minutes; I know you must be worried about your mom.

My heart breaks for you; I don't know how to apologize to you anymore. I will love you for the rest of my life, my beautiful chubby kitty; thank you for being the best cat that can exist in this world and for loving me unconditionally. I love you Manchitas

Sincerely, your mum.",,,,,,,,,,

Is anybody else here unable to access a relatively peaceful method?,2673974,ijustwishtodie,"Sep 18, 2024 at 8:05 AM","I already feel like an alien when comparing myself to normal people but I also feel like an alien here as well due to how it seems like that people here have a relatively peaceful way of getting out of here... that way mainly being SN. It doesn't feel like there's anybody else here aside from FC who is unable to access a decent method but perhaps I'm wrong.

In my case, I can't access SN because I live with parents who are super strict and always like to spy on me. I'll never be able to get SN whilst I'm living with them as I can't go outside on my own without their permission nor can I order anything on my own. The issue is that I won't ever be able to escape my parents as I don't have the necessary skills to be independent nor do I have any desires to be independent as I always take the path of least resistance and being independent = more resistance due to it being more responsibilities.

Because of my parents, I can't access most suicide methods. At best, I could attempt drowning myself in a random nearly lake/river but I'd have to sneak outside late at night and even then I'm worried that won't work as my parents are super light sleepers and will most likely wake up when I try to leave the house. Additionally, even if I were to successfully escape, I wouldn't have much time as my parents wake up in the middle of the night to read an islamic prayer.

I envy people here so much as they seem like they can easily access SN. If I had access to SN, I'd be gone a long time ago. I'm not staying alive because there's anything in life that I enjoy or want to do... no, I'm only staying alive because I'm forced to as I don't have a guaranteed and peaceful way out of here.

Please tell me that I'm not the only one who's like this. Actually, no, it'd be better if I was the only one as then everybody else here can easily escape existence but surely life isn't only cruel to me, right? I'm in so much pain just thinking about this. It hurts way too much :(",,,,,,,,,,
Is anybody else here unable to access a relatively peaceful method?,2673980,Hunterer,"Sep 18, 2024 at 8:17 AM","No, life isn't just cruel to you. I also don't have access to the common methods that most people would use. I'm also not independent, I don't have money, and so I can't buy the resources I need to put the methods into practice. I also don't have the freedom to go out, because I still live with my family, and I have to explain and justify pretty much every action I take to them. My only option would be to sneak out.

Because of these problems, I've also been thinking about drowning myself in a lake or something similar, but the chances of that going wrong are very high, for several reasons. But if everything goes well, I'll have some money at the end of the month and I'll try to buy SN discreetly. I hope everything works out, both for me and for you. None of us deserves to continue suffering, for whatever reason.

In short, my situation is very similar to yours.",,,,,,,,,,

The only good thing is that I live in a country where the sale of NS is legal, but it doesn't help much, since I don't have the money or the privacy to store it in a suitable place. Not only that, but I would still have to buy the antiemetics needed to put the method into practice if I manage to buy NS. But, if I can't buy it, I have 2 options: the first is to wait until I get a larger amount to cover all the expenses of the method, and the second option is to use the drowning method, which I know will be incredibly painful.

I've considered the train method before but the loud sounds of a coming train are already unsettling and at that point, the entire method becomes terrifying. Drowning is a very uncomfortable and scary method imo.
I consider hanging time to time but I think I would mess all up if I somehow managed to make a noose. I'm also not planning to even try to get SN.",,,,,,,,,,

Introduction:
I start here simply by a ""if you're reading this I'm dead, enclosed are my final wishes""

Then there's a table of contents with the General Letter, Personalized Letter, Items of Significance, Burial, Final Wishes

General Letter: is just the basic 'I've been wanting to this for a while.' Stuff

Then I put Personalized letters: I have a section each dedicated to the people I'm disappointing so that way they don't have to deal with the vague letter. Just tying up loose ends and get more specific and all.

Items of Significance: is just a list of items i want going to certain people

Burial: Just listing any sorta wishes here, which honestly isn't much. I don't want one

Final Wishes: Here i just clear anything else up and say goodbye for real, like asking them not to sorta talk about me and shit

I've written probably 2 dozen different notes over the past 2 years, but I've never been able to write a ""traditional"" note and be satisfied with it. There's too much to say (I'd like to keep it to a single page), and I can never quite write it the way i want it to come out. So this time around, I just gave my motives plain and simple (even though those around me are already familiar with them. I'm writing them so they won't forget). Essentially just, ""My motives are:"" and then a couple bullet points with about a paragraph for each specific reason to keep it concise. To close it, I then wrote a brief piece on the Right to Die for All, since that is probably the most important issue in the world to me. I don't expect it to actually effect any change (I don't even want it to go beyond my family members), I simply want to express something near and dear to my heart as my final message. I've had this note written for the past couple weeks and I feel very satisfied with it, especially since I kept it so simple. I feel like I fucking cooked with this one for sure.

Otherwise, when I found automating to be a pain I settled for typing it out then transferring it by hand. I find myself never quite satisfied from my words and found it exhausting to word things in the proper way personally.

My long-winded ""note"" will just be kept on my desk at my residence for anyone to find and whether they read it or throw it away is up to them. As for my summarized version it will be located on my person in the right pocket of the pants my body will be donned in (likely covered in feces which is why I'll not have it in a back pocket).

My letters mainly consist of the story of my life from my years as a toddler to my expiration at 35 years of age and mentions of many events in my life and my personal perceptions of them from my feelings to how they affected my life, influenced my relationships, etc. It's fairly in depth and I made sure to take my time to make sure I missed as little as humanly possible.

The summarized version basically eschews all the ""chaff"" and showcases the primary reasons for me choosing to CTB and what led to such. It mentions how I've always loved and cared too deeply, was ""burnt"" a plethora of times due to such, and how the trauma and realization of certain factors pertaining to the human condition piling up led to me no longer finding enjoyment in life and that I had wished to end things on my own terms before everything spiraled out of control.

About how I had slowly and painstakingly went from a bright-eyed young man filled with hope, love, and optimism was taken advantage of so many times that I felt my life itself stripped away before my eyes until nothing was left but an empty shell and that to ""live"" on would be a disrespect to the person I had once been.

I didn't pull any punches either to put it lightly, I wrote some severely harsh words and didn't hold back against those who blatantly wronged me of their own volition and quite literally placed the blame on me for the hardships they caused me to go through and on the flip-side I had written many words of thankfulness to those who did their best being there for me when I needed them most and made sure to let them know how happy I was to have met them.

I still have a bit to add to my extended version but I feel as though I have to be in a truly dark place to not do myself a disservice and currently I lack such as I am admittedly ""going through the motions"" currently but I plan on picking up a bottle of whiskey fairly soon and truly letting loose.

In all honesty, I probably should have stopped writing after 30 pages as I feel I may have tarried on about certain things for far too long but whatever, if a person wishes to read through my writings on a cold and rainy day I figured I may as well just put everything out there but I feel as though my extended letter may do more harm than good because it cuts painfully deep into subjects that many don't wish to talk about, let alone acknowledge the existence of.

Regardless, it will all likely be thrown away after a few short skims or put into a box somewhere to gather dust until thrown away during some moving process years from now.

The only reason I ever even wrote anything at all was to pass the time to be completely honest.",,,,,,,,,,

I questioned if things could have been different and blamed myself for things ending this way.

I don't really feel the same anymore. I've considered just saying ""sorry"" or something like that. I've also thought about being a bit more direct than before; I could talk about life as a whole feeling needlessly painful for me.

There's just been so much wrong with this individual existence for so long and it's all so bloody complex and intertwined, and I don't want any unanswered questions, because then people would most likely make assumptions and fill in the blanks themselves and god forbid think that my death was impulsive or ""a permanent solution to a temporary problem"", because it was anything BUT that. I want to make myself as clear as possible, so I figured the best way to do that was to basically just tell my story. SUPER extra, I know – it took me over 5 years, was an absolute bitch to write (especially in my absolutely abysmal physical state, and especially considering its actual contents), and I would have greatly preferred to just keep it short and sweet and been able to neatly list out my reasons why, and I definitely tried, but again, it's just not that straightforward, and the context and backstory is just too important to me to leave out. I mainly wrote it so that the people who are left behind will have answers and something to help them understand and get some insight into why all of this was unbearable and completely unsustainable, and will hopefully also help them in some way during the grieving process, but it also kinda helped me to process this whole shit-show of an existence in a sense as well.",,,,,,,,,,

Anyone who tried cutting the carotid artery but failed?,2676924,Skal,"Sep 21, 2024 at 4:01 AM","I'm considering cutting the carotid artery. I know this is not a recommended way to off yourself and that it would cause so much pain, but for the past 5 years I've tried hanging myself over 100 times and every attempt has failed, due to my cowardice.
I've tried almost every possible way, like partial suspension, full suspension, getting drunk to the point of puking, putting handcuffs on my hands, etc., Every time I'm almost passing out, there comes this very weird sensation inside my head that I just can't stand with, and eventually I can't help but stop hanging. After failing over 100 times, I gave up the idea of hanging myself.
But I can stand with the pain. Even when I did the full suspension, I could put up with the intense pain that comes from putting my full body weight on the neck. So, pain itself is not the problem. That said, I want to minimize the pain and the risk of failing, so I'd like to hear from anyone who has tried this and failed so I can learn from their mistakes.
Thank you in advance.

(Some may point out that it takes a lot of force to get through all of the muscle and tissue and to the carotid artery. To solve this problem I'm considering using my body weight; place the blade properly in front of the carotid artery, hold the knife with both my hands and fall with my body weight on top of it.)",,,,,,,,,,

Anyone who tried cutting the carotid artery but failed?,2676952,Skal,"Sep 21, 2024 at 5:40 AM","Didn't know about this method but sounds interesting. I saw a news report that an inmate offed himself by tying several socks together to make a ring, placing the ring around his neck, putting a chopstick between his neck and ring and rotating the chopstick to tighten the ring until it cuts off the blood flow. This sounds similar to that. I might try this before going for the artery cut. Thanks for the info.

I used a pull up stand to hang myself that had places to put my foot on (like this one), so I could stop hanging whenever I wanted to. I've tried surrounding the inside of the stand with cardboard so there's no place I can put my foot, and also putting handcuffs on my hands so I can't use my hands to escape, but even with that I failed 3 times. Each time the handcuffs made me so scared I couldn't stop but start breathing while hanging. And the funny thing is, trying to breathe while hanging stopped me from passing out. I don't know why, but I couldn't pass out even though my full body weight was being put on my neck. And because my neck was choked tightly, I could barely breathe, which made me suffocate and I struggled desperately to escape. While doing so somehow I managed to put my foot on something and I survived. After that, I struggled with the intense pain from the suffocation, which was more agonizing than the hanging itself haha.
As I said above I used a pull up stand, which is why I could escape. And because I can't go out of my house this is the only way to hang myself, so I can't rely on other options where you can't escape once you step off the chair.

(I gradually increased the load on my neck, starting with both feet on the ground, then one foot, then one toe, and finally full suspension). But I assume cutting would be a different type of pain, so that's a point of concern for me.

I don't have flashbacks anymore either. The memories have faded with the huge amount of work I needed to do in the past year to graduate.

And now that the sand has settled in my life and I'm out on the other side I need to say:

All of this really sucks.
It really truly sucks.
The dreams I had that I felt abuse and depression had taken from me are now in my hands and it truly truly sucks.

So I decided to give opiates a try.

Suicide by opiate overdose was my plan. My plan was always to get a enough to kill myself with and enjoy for some months before hand. Unfortunately, opiates aren't what I had been anticipating.

I am very susceptible to motion sickness so the feeling of opiates is close to a fever dream with the fever included. It's not entirely pleasant

I've realized my dreams and found nothing in it for me. I crossed my greatest taboo and found no real pleasure.

Seriously what is this life thing if even opiates can't keep me invested.

That's my update. Thank you for reading.",,,,,,,,,,

I have used opiates off and on for 15+ years now (nearly half my life) and that is my personal experience anyways. Just a few ago I took 130mg's of morphine throughout one day and it was a perfect day but the next morning I realized that nothing had changed and I still desired to CTB. Then after that an ex reconnected with me and I was happy for a while but once I got to realizing that she was an ex for a reason my desire to CTB came back yet again.

Just because there are ups in life doesn't mean that the baseline and the downs aren't the majority of our existence.

I have a handful of days left until I receive my SN and then I plan to CTB a few weeks after that. This life is truly a sick joke and a few positives will never outweigh a life filled to the brim with negatives that turned a hopeful and happy person into a traumatized mess.",,,,,,,,,,

is anyone else suicidal because of autism,2679681,Jon Arbuckle,"Sep 23, 2024 at 3:51 AM","I truly despise being autistic, I feel like almost every fucking negative trait I have can be attributed in part to my autism.
I feel like every other person in the world has something to them that I'm just ""missing"" from myself, I somehow manage to always choose the worst possible thing to do or say when interacting with others. I'm always fucking up. all I do anymore is look back on social interactions I've had and think ""why the fuck did I say/do that? what the hell is wrong with me?""
hell, sometimes I even second guess my stupid fucking decisions on what to do, I think ""maybe this is a bad idea."" and then I DO IT ANYWAY.
I feel like trying to reduce this behavior is a fruitless endeavor because it's almost like an instinct for me to act awkward and make others uncomfortable, it's built into who I am and trying to fix it would be like putting lipstick on a pig.

The better days are making everything worse,2679665,lawlietsph,"Sep 23, 2024 at 3:16 AM","I'm sorry but I really need to get this out of my chest...
So last month, in august, I've had 2 weeks when I was seeing everything annoyingly positive and I have no idea why. Never in my 28 years have I had a truly happy day or anything, sadness and melancholy is my personality and I've accepted it long time ago.
But on this 2 weeks, somehow my brain started to work differently.
I've had thoughts that I've never had before, like
""It's okay, my life is actually beautiful""
""I can make myself pretty and I'll find a good boyfriend, then everything is going to be awesome""
""I will find a way to be rich, don't worry""
""I'm not even that ugly""
+ I've started to work out, eat less junk food.

BUT...
After this 2 weeks, one day I woke up and felt the biggest, most horrible depression again. And since then, all I want to do is to die.
Now the thing is, I feel even worse than ever before. I just don't understand my brain anymore. Now I look in the mirror, and all I see is the most disgusting, ugly, horrible creature who deserves to die in the most awful ways. All I see is my ugly, old, worn out clothes because I don't have money to buy new ones. I fucking hate the sunshine, it makes me want to hang myself instantly. I want to die because breathing takes all my strength.
And I just fucking hate how my brain plays these tricks on me. It's not that I'm bipolar or anything, no, I've only had these 2 weeks in my whole entire existence and I just don't understand.
Now that I've experienced it, I want to feel good again. I want it so bad, but it's just gone.
My life is fucking pointless, I am back in the jealous state of mind, when all I see is how everyone have money, fame, beauty, except me.
I want to die so bad, and I'm scared. All alone, lonely, ugly, poor, I am always always always alone.
I wish to have the money to buy SN because existence is unbearable. Waking up is the worst feeling in the entire world.",,,,,,,,,,
The better days are making everything worse,2679682,hopemeetshopeless,"Sep 23, 2024 at 3:56 AM","I feel this. In a slightly different way, but still similar in a lot of ways. I've never quite had 2 straight weeks that I can remember that resembled anything close to feeling ""positive, thinking my life is beautiful, thinking I'm attractive or will find a partner who would love me, that everything would be ""awesome"", that I'd get rich, that I'm not ugly, that I'd stick to my work out routine or diet. I've had glimpses though. I have had small short spurts. The longest maybe 5 days give or take a little bit. It comes in waves for me, more frequent short lasting waves though. It used to be a more ebb and flow but now the tide kinda just always swallows me. I used to be like that kind of though. I used to have days where I tricked myself into thinking I could get better. That I could change. That I had the ability to just change some shitty habits and quirks in my personality and then everything would be ok. Fuck. I tried. I wanted it. I get it. Then it just wins. The depression just fucking wins. It's stronger than me. It's faster than me. It's smarter than me. I can't beat it because it IS ME. Like, I'm at war with myself everyday and the part of me that is self hatred that wants me dead is relentless. It has infected my consciousness to where it has essentially hijacked my entire mind to where there is nothing but negativity no matter which direction I look. It sucks. I'm sorry. This website has brought me so much comfort since I found it. Not enough, but it is very nice to find a community of people that don't gaslight you and invalidate your thoughts and feelings when you have no one to talk to. I hate this shit. For me. For all of us. I know that doesn't change anything but I really do. I don't think any of us deserve this shit.",,,,,,,,,,
The better days are making everything worse,2679690,lawlietsph,"Sep 23, 2024 at 4:09 AM","You actually described it perfectly. I wish for these ""better"" days to not even exist because it just makes everything worse.
I think overall hope is what makes things awful.
The slight hope that maybe one day you'll wake up and see things differently.
Hope that this world isn't so cruel after all, and it was all just a dream, because people are good and there's no cruelty, poverty, suffering.
But there is.
The reality is that all of this is just horrible. I don't want to have hope anymore, because it makes me feel worse.
And like you've said, depression always wins in the end, you cannot fight it. I've tried therapy maaaany times for many years, and yeah, it made me feel slightly better for an hour after the session, but that's it. I took antidepressants for 15 years, but all it did was making me feel numb. There's no cure and you can't run away from your own head.
I like this site too, because I don't have to be scared from getting messages like ""OH, HAVE YOU TRIED SPORTS AND MEDITATION? "" but it doesn't bring that level of comfort I wish to have. Anyway",2679682,,,,,,,,,

Hanging seems like such a hard way to go, considering that you know that, shows you really want to escape. Something to consider with any suicide, is to be mindful of how this will effect others. Whether its family who will find out or whoever it is that finds you, somewhere along the line your death will impact another persons life. I'm not sure if you care about that but its something to think about in these moments you want to be your last. Your death will have meaning to someone out there, regardless of who it is. I'd also like to throw in that I, myself, I really don't know what exactly I believe in, in regards to whatever it is that may be outside of humanly life. However, I do think something put us here and that there had to be something before life and something after death. What it is? I am not sure but there's a chance that there is something. Regardless of what that something may be, if countless religions can agree that suicide leads to something ""bad"" in whatever comes next, despite the fact that religions bicker with each other over who is right and wrong about things, perhaps suicide could very well be a negative thing. Whatever you end up doing, I wish you the best and hope you find peace. Just take my words as some food for thought or perhaps nothing at all.

I found two similar cases in the literature to try and see what might have been the difference between these two. They both died - yes, but one by strangulation after the rope broke and one by decapitation.
An uncommon suicide method: Self-strangulation by vehicle-assisted ligature
Vehicle-assisted ligature decapitation – an unusual case report

There are some interesting similarities between these two cases, but it seems like, based on the reading of the second article there were a couple of differences:

Despite the second article claiming it was a 20M rope- the car traveled reportedly traveled 42M in a straight trajectory. This make me think that the rope was longer than the first example.

The placement of the rope seems to be different from the first article, as in the first one, the rope was on the opposite side of the driver - which could have caused more shear stress, eventually leading to the rope breaking before decapitation.

So, I would say make sure the positioning of the rope is on the drivers side, or can be tied through the back of the car, as this would give you a straighter line - leading to less shear stress. Then I would make sure the rope is able to handle the forces applied, it is long enough, and that I removed the headrest.",2676907,,,,,,,,,

Id estimate full decapitation at 20-40%, but death at 95-99%. Depends also on your car, if in those 50m, your car can only be going 30-40 kmph thats bad, but if anything above 50, death is almost guaranteed.

An ex messaged me out of nowhere yesterday,2676824,Trav1989,"Sep 21, 2024 at 12:29 AM","Okay, this is quite weird so let me start from the past. Prior to meeting my ex-wife I was in a relationship with a woman from 2016-2018 which ended abruptly after an argument about her talking to another guy behind my back and I broke up with her and kicked her out of my house two days later. A few months later I had met my future wife and married her in 2019 and we were together officially until earlier this year (but she had left me 4 months prior for another guy then another, then another, then another, etc). Fast-forward to yesterday.

My ex found me on Facebook and sent me a message telling me that she missed me and I was the only guy who treated her well and that she was engaged to a man she didn't love and wanted to make sure it's what she wanted to go through with. She asked how I was doing and I told her I was married and divorced my wife because she cheated on me and after some more small talk she told me that she still loved me. She even went as far as to say that she wants me to pick her up from her fiancés place in January after she gets her affairs in order because he is physically abusive and she wants to move in with me and restart.

I told her I wasn't sure and would have to think about things over the weekend.

I find this particularly odd because my SN will arrive next week and I am planning on CTB the first week of October...

I am not sure I can go through with another relationship after the trauma my ex-wife put me through and I most certainly did NOT expect my prior ex to write me. In fact, I had mostly forgotten about her because I knew she was with someone else but deep down I knew that she never wanted things to end between us but I was extremely straightforward back then and unforgiving.

I honestly still want to CTB and I'm not sure I even want to deal with this life anymore but despite me telling her she should stay with her fiancé multiple times she showed me pictures of the bruises from him hitting her which obviously made me think twice. I just feel very conflicted right now and as I mentioned above, I'm extremely traumatized due to what my ex-wife put me through and having to deal with life until next year at the earliest to see what becomes of this sounds like a living hell to me.

I told her that there are other men she could find than me but she kept insisting that she still had feelings for me and it was our chance to be together and that she tried to message me multiple times in the past when I was with my wife but I never noticed them at the time but when I looked in my inbox, yep they were there so I supposedly clicked them but didn't read them or reply back.

She has been contacting me off and on for years and this time I finally noticed her message within two weeks of me deciding to CTB.

I will admit that I do very much desire to CTB still and her messaging me doesn't change that fact in the slightest but I'm kind of aggravated because this gives me hope when I had none and I hate second guessing myself. I know how things go though, we'll be together for a few years and the honeymoon phase will end and then things will slowly deteriorate until nothing is left like every other relationship I've ever had that I didn't cut off early.

But then in the back of my head I'm thinking ""maybe this is the one time things will work"". I want to be out of this existence so badly and now this happens, it's like a cruel joke honestly. I've already promised myself that IF I even consider her offer I'm going to give it ONE chance and the moment I feel like things aren't going to work out during this time period I'm calling things off and moving forward with my plan anyways.

I'm just not sure that even if I do go through with the living option I have enough left to even offer somebody else because I've been through a lot and it just feels like a waste of time the more I think about it. My ex cheated on me the entire last year of our marriage with dozens of men by prostituting herself because I rarely bought her frivolous things and focused on paying the bills and putting food on the table. How am I to know that even though my prior ex says she is genuine that she isn't just putting up a front like my ex-wife did for years while she drained my savings?

I just feel very skeptical of it all and this further reinforces my belief that the only truth in life is death and that everything that happens in this existence other than that absolute is fabricated.

I'd like to know the opinion of others reading this post.",,,,,,,,,,

She wants to use you to enable her to escape her abusive boyfriend, because she has no one to turn to. Simple.

Yes that was blunt, but 100% truthful. ..

You are exes for a reason, don't forget that. I have made mistakes of taking exes back, and trust me, it is a VERY bad idea, it WILL be the same. I took an ex back after a decade of no contact and well, all I'll say is: it ruined my fucking life. He ruined my fucking life (AGAIN). It took me years to rebuild myself, just like the last time he ruined my life, but this time I had to move hundreds of miles (secretly) to get away from him.

Don't make that mistake. Learn from your previous history with her. Life is about learning from our mistakes (for the record I was very young the first time, and thought he was different the second time) so do that and forget about her.

Your gut instinct is there for a reason, do NOT ignore it like I did. Shit people do not change.

She probably wants pity, why else would she tell you all that when you haven't even seen or spoken to her for years? Talk about oversharing. She is likely desperate, that's why she is planning ahead (planning for safety reasons so he doesn't notice she's left). That's a huge responsibility to take on, and one you shouldn't - she should go to a Women's Refuge where she can get the correct help and support, not into another relationship when she's just been abused, and she knows that - like I said, she's desperate and will do anything to get away from that piece of shit in her life.

Best of luck with it and always remember you're not responsible for others - you can help people in other ways, by giving them phone numbers, website addresses, advice etc (if you want to).",,,,,,,,,,

An ex messaged me out of nowhere yesterday,2678960,Trav1989,"Sep 22, 2024 at 3:28 PM","Yeah, I feel as though she knows that I'm a stable person who knows what I want from life (contrary to me being on this forum) and I was always fair with her. She also knows that I lack ambition and am content with just the bare minimum. I am quite sure that if we were to get back together things would supposedly be going swimmingly for a good 6 months to a year before she would grow bored of being with me and then start looking for the next guy. Everyone has flaws and while mine are lack of ambition and straightforwardness she is somewhat extreme in regards to being the polar opposite.

If my past with her is any indication of her character she is always looking for the next ""high"" and relishes the chase over the reward, once she gets what she desires she grows bored and places her catch on a pedestal before going on the hunt again. She will emotionally play her partner and lie to get what she wants and weaponize sex.

My ex-wife was similar to this woman but far less overt about it, she would do things behind my back but would be extremely secretive about it and only admit such once she knew she had a path to move forward so I can honestly say I have a lot of experience with such behavior sadly.

As somebody who wears their heart on their sleeve and has always been very open it's become glaringly obvious when people who do not share the same beliefs present themselves to me. I've always been that ""safety net"" for women who are troubled throughout most of my adult life, they know I'm not abusive or manipulative but they also know they are only going to get what they see so it's a double-edged sword. I'm going to give them stability but they'll never realize their lofty goals with me either.

This has happened to me possibly a dozen times in my life, there have been a few occurrences where my ex's would show up at my doorstep late at night or early in the morning with nothing but their clothes on their back and ask me if they can stay, we then usually end up having sex, then end up in a short/medium-term relationship, they get a job, buy a car, meet some guy at work, then next thing you know they run off with him and a few years later they are back and it all repeats.

It would be nice to believe in true love but in all honesty, I'm 35 and I've never really experienced it. Yeah, I've felt it towards others but it was never reciprocated and the longer I live the more I realize that everything relating to this existence is just a fabricated lie and that it's very seldom to find truth in a fictitious existence filled to the brim with bad actors.

Every ounce of pain and loneliness I've felt has just contributed to me desiring to CTB more and more, it all just feeds the fire that has been burning in me for decades and is about to combust but knowing me I'll just douse it with some water and fade off into nothingness.

I'm but a stepping stone along a path and none of those who cross me will ever realize how reliable I was until I am no longer there and then I'll be replaced with another who fits my mold and the world will continue on without me like it has until the Earth's surface is turned into glass.

Others will be 100% self aware, depending on the personality, and will play on it, and abuse you, and will *know* exactly what they're doing, but deny it.

Men are natural rescuers, but it is a flaw, and something you definitely need to work on, because otherwise you will never find someone that doesn't have those issues - there will be signs in the beginning that perhaps you overlooked, but it is there.

I do understand, because I've been with men like that, but I've now realised, at the same age as you (I'm also 35) that there's a reason I do this, and I'm working on it. Perhaps self sabotaging comes into play here - this is something we're not consciously aware of, but you can change it, if you want to. Start by not being so much of a people pleaser -trust me, I know how difficult it is, but I can tell you it attracts the wrong type of person, because it gives off push over vibes. It is *very* hard to overcome this, but you *can*, I promise. The first step is realising you can't fix people, and putting boundaries in place.

You are only responsible for yourself, no one else (unless you have kids, obviously). You're not too old to make changes, 35 is young, especially given you've spent your life this way and it's all you've known.

I've known people in their 40s, 50s, and 60s to still be this way so don't give up, there's plenty of time left! We all have things we should work on before leaving this world, no one is perfect by any means, but you owe it to yourself before leaving to at least try.

I brought up ending my life to her and she got angry, and all we do is fight. It's my fault to be in this situation, and sadly I've begun to realize that CTB might be my only way out.

I have a mental illness that gives me insomnia and have burnt so many bridges it's almost unforgivable. New jobs, friends, living situations, for a while I was independent and then slowly got worse, and am only getting more worse, and am at a point where I can't even stay at the local homeless shelter.

When I tell my family I might die outside in the winter they kind of just shrug, but if I mention I want to end my life so I don't have to suffer what would be a painful and miserable death, they shun me and get angry.

Sometimes death is the only way out of a bad situation. I pray you have something to live for or have options to improve your mental health.

For some, it probably is but for others it's not cause you continue suffer by masking how you truly feel. I've been trying to live for so long but Ik deep down inside I won't live to see my next birthday, and I've had this feeling since I was a kid. I've just never told nobody outside of this site. The only reason I made it this far is because I've seen myself living to this age and Ik nobody would take care of my mom if I'm not here but I can't and never have seen myself living past this age so Ik my time is coming. Now the last hurdle to get over is not caring about the repercussions of my death. Some will care while others won't and everyone will come up with their own reasons for why I did it but none will be correct. I'm not even gonna leave a note or anything, I'm just not gonna come home one day and hopefully my body won't be found.

My main reason for streaming/recording would be for education to fellow SaSu members, to show exactly what happens when following the SN protocols so people know what they might be getting into when using SN for CTB, such a symptoms, how quickly unconsciousness occurs, followed by death, etc.
I would also like to not feel alone in my final moments. I don't know why, but there is something comforting about it.
I am not sure how feasible it would be to livestream such an act without the stream being taken down or if someone would somehow send rescue services.


It's very much only an idea at the moment since I don't have a definitive CTB date as of right now. It's just a recurring thought when I do think of going through with the process.

the act of suicide was viewed much more appropriately before the late 19th century (the advent of psychiatry...) despite the condemnation of it by religious institutions, cause at least back then they'd acknowledge that you had agency and made your own decision, and that your struggles weren't the result of some ""disease"" or ""condition"" but rather real genuine circumstances that led you to that point. and seemingly counter-intuitively, the same goes for the fact that attempting suicide was a crime back then. this adds proof to the fact that suicide was seen as an act of volition, rather than the result of something they can blame it on/explain away like mental illness.",,,,,,,,,,

It seems like that killing yourself is WAY harder than it's made out to be. I can get access to a gun and think I might go that route. Even that's a bit controversial in how to do it. I decided that is if I can get a gun, I won't shoot myself in the head but in the chest. I assume it's way easier to shoot yourself in the heart than the brain stem. Of course, I'd take a bunch of pills and be drugged up when I do it. There is no way to survive a gunshot to the heart.

Any thoughts?

Also, I spoke with a lawyer today. She confirmed that I have no criminal case pending so they cops aren't probably out to arrest me. She said they have a search warrant but that doesn't add up. She said the best thing to do is go about my life and see what happens. After much thought, I don't think there's anything to go back after I tried killing myself on Tuesday.

SN Attempts Unsuccessful?,2660882,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 6, 2024 at 9:28 PM","Fwiw, vomiting is probably towards the bottom of the list of reasons why SN can fail. The dose we take of 25g is 8-25x the actual lethal dose, and this is done so that your body gets flooded with SN and even if you vomit you likely ingested more than enough; this is doubly true if you're taking Meto in your SN plan, since Meto speeds up gastric emptying thus quickly letting the SN enter your small intestine for absorption. So if you took Meto and vomited your SN, you likely ingested even more than someone who did not have an antiemetic. And the backup glass of SN is advised just to be safe. So in terms of vomiting, it shouldn't necessarily be a worry for you.

The first two reasons for failure that CantDoIt listed are your top concerns. You may feel the urge to call emergency services since SI can kick in while you're waiting to pass out, and SN symptoms can be scary if you're not ready for them. And if you don't live alone, there's always the chance someone will walk in on you, even if they aren't expected to return for a certain amount of time (coming home early, for example). From the SN successes and failures thread, it appears most failures were because someone came in too early, or they called emergency services before they passed out. The PPH also supports this claim, as failures are generally the result of medical intervention, rather than anything to do with the SN. Failures can also arise from not following protocol as well.

Hope this helps. And of course, do wait and see if anyone who has any personal experience with those things replies to this thread. Information is power.

edit: edited actual lethal dose numbers. Lethal dose for an average person is 22mg per kg (forgot about this, remember reading it somewhere though). So it can be anywhere from 25x the lethal dose if you're very light, to about 8x if you're quite heavy (not morbid obese though).",2660863,,,,,,,,,

SN Attempts Unsuccessful?,2676704,schrei_nach_liebe,"Sep 20, 2024 at 9:01 PM","I encountered or cared for SN attempts I think 8 times in my last job. These were all children tragically as it was pediatric critical care. It's hard to get exact info on what happened sometimes, but I usually saw them probably within an hour after ingestion. These being kids, there was probably more impulsiveness, less real planning, less ability to maintain privacy, imperfect execution. Once they're with us in that kind of emergent situation the parents could be there technically, but never were because things are so hectic, graphic, and they're usually being cared for at the hospital with some sort of support worker. What I'm saying is we're flying by the seat of our pants and treating only with the information we have based on what we can see right in front of us, at least at first. The info we get from parents and first responders is usually like ""thanks for the info"" or ""cool story bro, but I can't rely on that"". If the kid comes through, they usually give us a good idea of what happened, if they don't I don't really learn anything else after taking them to the morgue. Basically, it boils down to they didn't get a sufficient dose either from backing out, couldn't handle the taste, or vomited and were too weak to take more. A couple didn't show signs of methemoglobinemia, the others got methylene blue and some other stuff like atropine based on what the doc called for in addition to the methylene blue based on different variables. I didn't really see any deficits after the survivors came back, but some brain injuries don't show their full colors until later, like an anoxic brain injury which I do have myself, and it's weird. I think any method is subject to the same risk, but I think the aftermath with SN if you do live as at least physically not bad compared to other popular methods.",,,,,,,,,,
SN Attempts Unsuccessful?,2676741,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 20, 2024 at 9:55 PM","I don't think it's really the dosage, though it definitely plays a factor considering people eat meat with Sodium Nitrite in it; in food, very little SN is used, so it's not seen as a problem by the body. But SN when ingested in beyond-safe quantities is seen as a dangerous toxin by the body and it will try its best to expel it. It's a bit like alcohol, though not really. If you drink a beer, you'll be completely fine; if you drink 12, you're vomiting your guts out and then passing out for a good while.

And as for your second question, yes the high dose is necessary. You're trying to flood your body with as much SN as possible before it gets expelled. This is why we have a second or third glass as a backup, so you can continue to flood your body with more SN in case you expel too much with the first glass. The lethal dose is something like 22-30mg per KG of body weight, so for me at 45kg 25g is around 25.2x the lethal amount. This means I only really have to get like 5g in me to truly assure death, though people have died only taking like 1g accidentally.",2676697,,,,,,,,,
SN Attempts Unsuccessful?,2677035,Asleepatlast,"Sep 21, 2024 at 8:22 AM","Thank you for the info. It does make sense.

But I'm also still a bit confused. I understand wanting to assure death but if taking so much is making us vomit so that we have to take more and vomit more is it really necessary? If you are just vomiting it up anyway are you even investing more than if you took less in a still lethal dose?

I have a strong aversion to vomiting and an sounds like it comes with a lot of nasty side effects that could make our last few moments on earth a nightmare. I don't like the thought of that.",2676741,,,,,,,,,
SN Attempts Unsuccessful?,2677088,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 21, 2024 at 9:12 AM","well, considering i'm not an expert, it's important that I simply follow the well-established protocol. if it were well-documented that you could do it reliably with less than 15g, then perhaps i'd do less, but I also really want to make sure it works so i'd probably still do 25g. it's also worth noting that vomiting is usually never the cause of failure; the main causes of failure are being found too early or calling for help.

and if you don't like vomiting, well... this method likely won't be for you as it almost always causes nausea and vomiting. i'm personally fine with every symptom that SN causes, except tachycardia. but i feel it's worth it to fight through it if it means I finally get my escape. there are very few peaceful and painless deaths, so most deaths usually come with discomfort or suffering. the fortunate thing is with SN, it's only around 15-20 minutes of suffering (and not even that great of suffering). so i keep that in mind when thinking about SN and its effects.",2677035,,,,,,,,,
SN Attempts Unsuccessful?,2677675,Asleepatlast,"Sep 21, 2024 at 8:23 PM","That's very true. And if I didn't already have these symptoms with my health condition I don't think it would concern me so much.

I do get concerned because of my health these symptoms might be more intense for me than maybe others. Of course, no way to know until I try.

Hopefully the vomiting isn't too bad. I had norovirus recently and that consisted of over eight hours straight of vomiting and wretching. It was painful. My body was making me vomit even when I had nothing to vomit so I would quickly gulp down some water just to have something to throw up. I ended up hospitalized from the whole ordeal.

It's truly frustrating having to fight so hard for peace. I do hope it is quick.

My other major concern with this method is just having all that time for sn to kick in and for me to back out.

Apologies for dropping so much on you. There is no safe space anywhere else for me to confess these thoughts.

Thank you for taking the time to share your insight and knowledge about sn. Truly appreciated.",2677088,,,,,,,,,
SN Attempts Unsuccessful?,2677764,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 21, 2024 at 9:44 PM","Yeah there's no way to tell until you're actually doing it. I do hope that it doesn't go awry for you though.
Fuck, that sounds awful. I don't want to try and equate my experience to yours, but it sounds very similar to when I was given Fentanyl when I was in the hospital a while back. I was vomiting for hours and hours, to the point where most of my vomit was just bile. I don't really mind vomiting, but it was awful and exhausting. So in some way I can empathize with you here. Are you doing okay now? Does norovirus leave any lingering effects like covid can?

And if it's any consolation, I don't think SN will be like that. Usually people seem to just puke once or a few times, then they down their backup glass if they have enough strength and willpower left.
It really is. I've been at this, actively, for about 2 years now. After failing a shit ton with hanging, I eventually switched to SN. I'm really hoping this'll be my last attempt.

Compared to other methods, it is quite long but not as long as some. From what I've seen, it really should be under 20 minutes and then you're out. There are extreme edge cases where it took 30-40 mins (like StrawberryPanic, which took her like 34 min before unconsciousness if i remember correctly). So it is relatively quick, but it is more than enough time for doubt, panic, regret, and all that to set in. But you never know, some people are at great peace after they've taken SN. Though, there's no way to tell which type of person you are until you make the attempt.
Don't apologize! It's what we're here for - to speak freely with others in a supportive and relatively judgement-free space.

The Republican party actually leans further right in comparison to other conservative parties in other Western countries.

I want to CTB if Trump wins the election,2673261,uk_buscatcher_522,"Sep 17, 2024 at 4:43 PM","I hate Trump but IMHO (I wouldn't be on this site if I were only saying this to be pro-life) none of these are likely to happen. Also disclaimer that I'm British, but I'm a little bit autistically obsessed with US political & government stuff.

Weed is already criminalised federally; if the federal government tried to prosecute for it even in states where it's legal, they'd piss off both the stoners and the states' rights crowd. Criminalising alcohol would be an even bigger vote loser.

It's plausible that gay marriage becomes something where only some states can recognise it; Obergefell is the only thing standing in the way of that, and the current Supreme Court's composition might be keen to overturn that. But it's unclear to me whether Trump would even choose to go after gay people to do more than that. Recall that Trump was the first US president to voice support for gay marriage before inauguration day. He surrounds himself with lots of Christian types because he's in right-wing American politics and they're everywhere, but he'd only actually go after gays if it benefitted him in some way. And I really don't think it would - it'd galvanise the very fringe of his base who were going to support him anyway & repulse everyone else.

There are definite links between Trump and the Heritage Foundation, but most of the Project 2025 stuff I don't think is likely to actually happen - Trump cares only for himself and his popularity, and he wouldn't want to split his own base with insane policies. My concern here is that the politicisation of the Executive Branch might enable him to weaponise it to help in his scheming like he did post-2020 (stuff like getting an Attorney General who'll support his bullshit claims). But this is different to your fear.

Also, probably most importantly: a lot of this stuff is unconstitutional. Sure, abortion used to be considered a constitutional right, but it was on fairly shaky legal ground regardless. Roe identified the right under the ""penumbra"" of multiple separate rights, under a theory that the conjunction of these rights confers a right to an abortion. Even legal scholars are torn on this - while IMO the ruling had positive impacts - the actual legal grounds undergirding it weren't hugely compelling in the first place.

But when it comes to stuff like theocratic government, this is a very clear-cut constitutional violation: the Establishments clause explicitly prevents this. I don't think even the current Supreme Court, with the wacky decisions it's made so far, would uphold an explicit policy decision made on religious grounds. We have to look at a case-by-case basis of which Project 2025 wishes could survive legal challenges.

As to why Trump even hangs out with the Heritage Foundation guys at all: I think they probably just give him lots of shit. Like they help galvanise his Christian base a lot, and probably give him lots of money (& free trips on a private plane!). And some parts of Project 2025, like the aforementioned politicisation of the civil service, are things Trump wanted to do anyway. But at core, Trump cares solely for himself. And going after the gays will not help himself at all, even if he somehow succeeds at getting it through the courts.

tl;dr (sorry I'm stoned and wrote more than I should've): Trump has 0 thoughts about anything other than himself, and doing a lot of the stuff you described would NOT help him at all. Also good chance some of this stuff wouldn't survive in the courts.",2673153,,,,,,,,,

It reminds me of those dudes who were try to argue that is centrist was punk, despite that subculture being well-known for generally leaning left. You don't vote for just yourself and your well-being, but also to ensure the well-being of those around you. To act as though both political parties are equal in how bad they are just highlights how ignorant you are to the ongoing issues with each party. One party doesn't mind taking away the rights of others they don't like. There is a reason why a lot of people from marginalized groups in particular are panicking right now and keeping a close eye on the election.

This is because white cis-women, especially those from a middle-class evangelical background, have a history of advocating for and furthering fascist movements. In 2016, 52% of white women voted for Trump. In 2020, 55% of white women voted for Trump. Compare this with Black, Asian, and Latina women, who overwhelmingly voted for Biden (especially black women). Now, this isn't me trying to slander white women since I'm aware that a lot of white women aren't right-wingers, let alone Trump supporters, but this does open an interesting conversation about the impact that white women have when it comes to these things. From the KKK to prominent right-wing pundits, like Lauran Southern, white women have a history of supporting white supremacy, and upholding the regressive systems and beliefs that plague our society.

I haven't gotten the chance to finish the whole video yet, but so far it does a pretty good job at breaking this all down (much better than I'll ever be able to do). Warning, it's pretty long.


Despite the image of the right that is commonly presented to us, one filled with dissatisfied and misogynistic men, looking to take away the rights of women in an attempt to gain back the image of ""masculinity"" and power that belongs to them, this isn't an accurate picture. For example, white women have historically, and to this day, played a major role in the normalization of white supremacist and patriarchal beliefs. They were and still are the aids in helping to spread these beliefs, playing a crucial role in the background. This can especially be seen when looking at the role they played in the KKK. These women would do things, from organizing picnics to socials. We also see this when looking at a lot of tradwife content, with most of that content being produced by white women.",2673258,,,,,,,,,

00:45 Hands on stomach, Groans. load groans sounds like snoring. kinda like chocking

Regarding the bolded text above, I think she was conscious at that point, hence why she put her hands on her stomach. Possibly due to stomach burn which she had reported 10 mins prior (@ 00:35). Not trying to scare anyone off SN as it is 1000% my method (unless I can get N, or F or H).

Not like I'll recite his life story but from what he's told me and from the five years of working with him before he became very ill and even then is still helping his neighbors and wife and kids and smiles, never once sexulized me or made crude comments about women, he was a very open minded person, still is, he's understanding and seemingly able to conversate with anyone, he's never raised his voice or cursed at me or really in generally unless he's telling a joke, donno what I'm even getting at, it's just that with hik being the only person I somwhat opened up to at work he understood but in a diffrent way, because well, again, he wants life, he believes in goodness.

However, I do believe that people don't enjoy life as much as they like to claim they do. The key to understanding society is understanding that they lie all the time to others and to themselves.

Somehow I want to let proof of the domestic violence I'm suffering so if appears something about my desth in the future, people atleast here will know the torture I suffered since 2015. I'll say sorry after starting writting and documenting everything bc english isn't my natural language.
My mother(from bloodline) didn't took care of me causing me big scars from not taking care of the wounds in time and she was a alchoolic, I still have ptsd bc how I lived in that place where didn't even had doors or windows to protect me or her.
Alot of panic attack due to my brain blocked memories is coming back little by little, one of my sisters makes fun of my pain and even making my days a living hell making my adoptive mother being agains me.
One time when younger I did ask for help because of the abuses at home where she would treat me bad, that time I was (6/7) years old and even knowing my problematic and rough past she treated me very bad together with my brother in law, banging my head on the table when from stress I didn't understood the homework.
After that the rest of the years was chaotic and the only person that protected me was my adoptive father.
Even when I tried my best my sisters would push me around until today.
I'm getting verbal attacks every day even mentioning that my treatment and how is useless, when I got a volunter job at online games to fill this emptyness my mother and sister made me leave it bc how they treated me bad, that volunter jobs as admin were something that was helping me honestly.
With my adoptive fathers death my older sister keeps verbal attacks about how I kept the ring of my father and that I just gave attention to my mother and father like when I just needed something.
Honestly i'm typing and crying at the same time and with my 27 years I still get threats from them, that if I talk or tell about what happens here... They will take my things away and when I talked openly how I feel, I end being verbal attacked, I have a stash hidden when I decide to end it all... People here at home is making me go insane each day and honestly Idk therapy works for what? My therapist knows about this abuse and even threats agains my cat's life.
I want to someone to know the truth behind this fake happy family, where I get physical violence threats and I get verbal abused each time that she wants to release stress. Probably I'll make sure to attach files here and hopefully this will be marked here and my family won't be able to hide their dirty secret in case I end it all. Theres a lot more where my adoptive mother made me abandon my own cats and dogs, she used my credit card without my knowledge taking every cent that was there.",,,,,,,,,,

Above 4 years ago I got an idea in my head to cut myself and rub something fowl like feces into it to induce an infection and hope it turns septic and kills me. I've put off the idea for years, but today I just want to die. Unfortunately, the trauma caused by surviving my 3 major attempts in the past has me unable to overcome the SI required to actively CTB, so I've resorted to passive suicide methods like daily overdoses of OTC meds, chronic starvation, chronic dehydration, etc. Today the urge became too much. I cut myself on the part of the skin believed to harbor the highest amount of bacteria, rubbed an unspeakably disgusting substance into it, and taped it shut so the bacteria can't escape. Now only time will tell if it turns septic. If I see signs that I am going septic, I will not tell anyone. I will stay home and let myself fall into shock until I die. If it doesn't turn septic, then well I've just engaged in the most disgusting thing I've ever done in my life and I'll have to carry on.

Before anyone starts to lecture me, I work in healthcare. I am well aware of the process of developing an infection, the stages of sepsis, the symptoms, etc. I've been septic before due to a medical condition. I've cared for many patients with sepsis before and am aware of the implications of going into shock and surviving with permanent damage. I know this is an awful idea. And I also no longer care. I am tired of living but am unable to pull the trigger for an immediate and more guaranteed suicide despite having the means to do so thanks to the PTSD.

Early SI?,2675054,LionDad,"Sep 19, 2024 at 8:47 AM","So my SN is due to arrive tomorrow, over a week ahead of schedule. I've been obsessing over the tracking information since I bought it last Monday, counting the days until it arrives. I don't think excited is the right word but I've seen its arrival as a positive thing. Until now.

Now that I know it's coming tomorrow, I feel strange. Anxious, yes, nervous, yes, unsure, maybe, probably.

I've been set on closing the book (personally I hate ""catching the bus"", closing the book sounds more in control and almost poetic) for a few months. I've tried three times in the past, two small almost cry for help efforts and one checking out effort that left me in hospital for nearly three months. I decided on sn a few weeks ago because I need three things - I need it to be clean so that nobody has to clean me up, I need it to be reliable so I don't fail again, and I need the lasting damage to be minimal incase I do fail.

It's a funny feeling today. I'm certain I don't want to stay, but not so certain that I want to go. Maybe it's because it's early or maybe it's because, tomorrow, it will be real.

I know I don't have to go tomorrow just because it's arrived, I can wait and see how I feel; I've got three years if I store it correctly. But what if this is some form of si? I never had si with my last two attempts, I don't even remember the last one - I just woke up in hospital five weeks later.

Islam is a backward sect, it's CLEARLY evil when you really analyse it with honesty, muslims pretend its not because of social pressure and threat of being casted out or even killed, and non-muslims people (kuffars) are understandably scared of reprisal, because Islam is the most violent religion. It has all this violence and punishments because it knows its in the wrong, otherwise if it was an intellectually honest religion it would have no reason to physically punish disaproval. Have you EVER had or seen a muslim give an intellectually honest argument? Absolutely never personally, they always use dirty fallacies.
This sect controls its subjects by using fear and very dirty psychological tactics, its discustingly evil really it caused so much evil you can't even begin to imagine. Imagine arab countries without Islam. Just compare Afghanistan or Iran or even Turkey when under non-islamic regimes, with today.
Now even as an adult who lives in a non islamic country (France), i will forever be persecuted. All of my black and arab muslim friends wouldn't want to be my friend anymore and would harass me if they saw me eat pork, and my family would disown me. And im a male, muslim women have it way harder.

Unfortunately, that isn't a case and, even on here, islam gets a free pass to criticism. I think that I understand why though as, to a western people who never had to deal with islam, they don't see islam as a bad thing as it doesn't affect their lives much. In the west, islam only really affects those with islamic families.

I'm an ex muslim so I understand your sentiment. Modern day islam is far worse than any other modern day religion. There are so many issues that islam has which other religions don't have. Also, leaving islam comes with massive severe consequences such as getting beat up, getting disowned or, in the case of muslim majority countries, getting killed. This is because muslims have been taught to value allah and pedo mo over their own children and that's exactly what muslims do.

I don't believe in any religion but I would far prefer being an ex christian than an ex muslim as the former can at least share that to their parents and no consequences would happen.

My fuckinh wife gets mad at me and tells me ""he doesn't understand."" He does have some mental issues, however he does this to NO ONE else, and I constantly tell him to stop and I this is the first time I reacted angrily because it doesn't seem to work.

You know whats fuckin crazy? Ive been constantly telling her this example is why I feel my feelings and words dont matter in our marriage. You know what I get? Silence. In fact, she is the victim actually cause Im just a fucking damn shitty husband. EVERY FUCKINH TIME SHE HAS A PROBLEM WITH ME, I CHANGE. I SACRIFICED MY FUCKING CHILDHOOD FRIENDS BECAUSE SHE WAS INSECURE. And yet, she keeps saying I'm just gonna leave her or something.

My OCD qnd her therapist make me think Im so shitty and Im so fucking confused. I ask outside people to tell me if Im crazy, and I always am careful to not show my bias. I care alot about growing into a better person but its never fuckinh enough
Im always doing another damned thing wrong.


I mist literally be the single shittiest subhuman trash alive if i cant do anything right. Right?

I told her and our marriage counselor I had gender dysphoria. They basically made me choose and I said I chose my wife. I told the marriage counselor I felt unheard and unimportant in our marriage, I was told that I was co-dependant. So so many other things that happen and every single fucking time I choose whats best for her and our marriage. Im the only one who changes and she had the fucking audacity to tell me I was unwilling to sacrifice for this marriage. Giving my childhood friends away, suffering gender dysphoria when I could literally go through transition for free right now, changing anything and everything she asks me to, and still fucking smiling when Im with her is not enough.

I cant even cut anymore because she looks for scars and gets angry at me for having them.

What am i doing wrong. i ask the therapists i ask family, and i change accordingly but its never enough. im simply not enough. i know its not one to one, but so many people tell me im kind But maybe those were all lies? Or i changed? Did i just put on a facade?

I was supposed to kill myself, or atleast have all my materials by august. But I didnt have the money to buy SN. I didnt know it was so expensive. i kinda forgot about it since then, but I think ill buy it now. If im dead it wont matter anymore cause i cant do anything more wrong.

im so fucking scared of hell. I know i'm saved, i believe in Jesus, but i keep thinking that if i died i would just wake up in hell anyways because im just so horrible. How could i call myself a christian? i try to love everyone no matter who or where they came from, but im still just so bad.

I binge drank a lot in periods, and it almost destroyed me and I stopped immediately one day after puking tiny pieces of blood and looking at chats realizing I had lost the memory of a whole week of events . Now I just crave it, but remind myself that the feeling of contentment or euphoria from drinking only lasts 40-60 minutes and then I cry, get depressed and/or angry while still drunk and destroying my organs. After sobering up, I feel more anxiety than normal, which is when the endless loop starts of wanting to drink even more. Also, I suffer from insomnia sometimes, and while drinking knocks me out eventually, it destroys sleep quality and when you stop it just worsens the insomnia (which in some cases may be permanent). It also kills your organs slowly, eventually giving you a very slow painful death, or worse, a coma first. Before the coma you may also get your brain and memory destroyed (Wernicke-Korsakoff disease, which is some of the most scary things I've read about). It's a stupid drug. Even cocaine and heroin are less harmful (look it up).

So when you realize that ""not even alcohol is helping me feel better"", just give it up before you get worse. There are better ways to feel better, coming from me who is diagnozed with severe depression (like, top score in tests and evaluations by multiple psychiatrists).",,,,,,,,,,

Still, it can also work in the opposite way. Imagine a genuine member genuinely attempting and it's not working out. I suspect they're terrified and they can't talk to anyone else, so they come here for support and get the third degree in questioning, plus people calling them out to be fake. I do remember this happening once... I think the consensus ended up being that they had been sent something other than SN but, it can't have felt great for the OP:

failed SN - not sure why?
last night i attempted: 1 hour before - paracetamol 45 mins before - domperidone 3 x 10g and propranolol 30 min before - 3 valiums took a couple mg melatonin and smoked some weed about 5/10 mins before SN drink - 20gm in 50ml water i'm so confused, i woke up this morning a bit drowsy but...
sanctioned-suicide.net

People can get extrememely defensive of SN in particular I've noticed. I can sort of understand it. It's my likely method too. It's unpleasant to think it could go wrong. Really, it would be better to actually know of failed attempts if we could be sure they were genuine. Including- why they likely failed. That's surely how protocols are formed- people collating data to see what the most successful attempts entailed. But, I don't know how we could differentiate genuine attempts from possibly fake threads.

I think there needs to be a balance between people genuinely trying to find out why an attempt may have failed- which I guess includes wondering whether it is a genuine post. Still- I don't think we can do that openly on a thread without insulting the OP- who could be genuine.",,,,,,,,,,

Fake SN Posts,2674911,Intoxicated,"Sep 19, 2024 at 5:15 AM","I'm very skeptical about any reports that mention vomiting despite following the protocols which impose strong restrictions on ingestion of liquids. Throwing up needs something to throw in the first place - this is just a matter of common sense, you don't have to be a professor of medicine in order to understand that the stomach can't obtain a substance out of nowhere for pushing it through the esophagus. If we assume that it could somehow throw miserable 50 - 100 ml of salty mixture once, further vomiting would not be possible without consuming more drinks. Sob stories about 7 episodes of vomiting with a nearly empty stomach are probably targeted to brain-dead people who'd never think how puking works.

I also believe that skeptical responses in such goodbye threads are well-justified. If the OP of a goodbye thread tells shocking stories about applying their method, this is no longer just a simple ""goodbye"" thread and the OP should be prepared to inconvenient questions, since many people here can make important decisions based on the provided information.

If you add nearly 60 ml of salty mixture to this, pushing such small amounts of fluid out the stomach should still be difficult at least. This would require strong contractions.

High places in Buffalo?,2661682,naomewki,"Sep 7, 2024 at 1:54 PM","does anyone know of any high accessible places in Buffalo? originally i thought of going to Niagara Falls but it seems overly complicated and i get lost way too easily due to my anxiety and then i thought of jumping in front of a train but was stopped by police before i even got there and taken to CPEP for 3 days so i think that's too risky now to even go remotely close to a train station with their police presence, ive also tried researching into high places here but it seems like all of the news articles that come up are extremely old and the place has changed with time, i would really appreciate any help if possible thank you for reading",,,,,,,,,,

I miss that City but I had a couple quite severe episodes there, but I think of that town often. Sorry I'm not a more help but I can't help but reminisce, but many cold nights, very lonely walking down Elmwood
I cared for a young woman who was permanently bound to a nursing home, this was in another city in New York, she jumped from 4 stories high and just became a paraplegic with little use of one arm and obviously no use of her legs. Incredibly sad 20 something and relegated to a nursing home forever wearing a diaper.
I don't mention this story as a scare tactic but just as a reminder how questionable even that height is, poor woman. I also worked with two individuals who will forever be in a nursing home due to strokes and seizures caused from attempted ODS

Self-Gaslighting,2678424,OutOfThisBody,"Sep 22, 2024 at 12:38 PM","Even when I'm by myself and feeling horrible about why I want to kill myself a part of me will squash those feelings and tell me im stupid for thinking them and it makes me feel embarassed. Why can I not even agree with myself? Why can't I be on my own side? I feel like it comes from not wanting to show negative emotions around my parents because they would overreact.

But living in that gaslighted mindset is bad in its own way. It only happens because I want to please other people. It was similar in therapy, they would tell me how lazy I was and how I had to take responsibility and I would force myself to agree despite my embarassment at their words when really I didn't give a fuck. Why should I?",,,,,,,,,,
Self-Gaslighting,2679152,Redacted24,"Sep 22, 2024 at 6:03 PM","To me, it seems that much of how we spend our days is like a performance. We play our part, just like everyone else. When what we want to say differs from the script, we feel challenged to say what is in our hearts with clarity and honesty because the other cast members wouldn't know how to respond. And society doesn't know what to do either usually.
That's why places like this are so invaluable.
Here there are people that get it. It's empowering to have that.

Sorry it's not really much of an answer, but I struggle with wanting to be heard too and keep playing the role even though I'm so not that person others see in me.",,,,,,,,,,

Finally. 17 more days.,2661126,greyblue_bian,"Sep 7, 2024 at 2:44 AM","Update: I forgot to post yesterday. But, nothing happened. I've only tried cleaning around my house but that's about it. I still need to finish my note and I finally started it not too long ago, but I've run out of energy again to continue writing it. I also feel the need to tell my life story over again, I think in an effort to try to re-claim it my own before I go. I know for a fact there will be a lot said after I'm gone and the people who'll be doing the most talking and the least (somehow at the same time) will be the people who have done the most damage. I've been pushed off the edge. I've been abused for long enough and I am tired. Life is not easy and I am weak. But, I still tried. I did try. I tried listening to others' guidance and I even tried listening to my own in spite of the ""loop"" my life seems to be on. I've tried getting better multiple times and made my efforts at surviving and obviously, I've just barely survived everything. I made my attempts obviously. And the only thing I regret is them not succeeding. I could've avoided so much if I had died the first time. Because of what's happened, I've given up entirely to the point where I've put myself in dangerous and self-harming and humiliating situations I wouldn't have before because I've been forced to forget who I am. I have been shown it's not important, that it will never matter more than who other people think I am does. I tried ""reviving"" myself, but I don't have any interest anymore. The only reasons I have pro-longed my life is because of my friends, because of my two cousins who are basically like siblings to me. They are the only people who care. They have been the only people to treat me like a human being. With them, I am safe. They are safe. Things are calm and things are healthy. They do what they can for me and I try my best to do what I can as well. I know it's not much. They claim otherwise but I'm just hopeful I've been helpful somehow.

I still wait around for the apologies I think I ""deserve"" and have ignored everyone telling me that karma is real in efforts to get me to let my guard down. It contradicts them also telling me to forgive them without an apology. But if I'm making this about deserving, they don't deserve it. I always thought that I never knew or was taught how to forgive or just that I wasn't capable of it, but that's proven not to be true. I know how to forgive someone who's wronged me because I've done it before with a proper apology. With the people who have wronged me and apologized taking accountability for what they've done entirely and I've been able to move on. That's been something that is really rare for me to come by. I haven't experienced it from family. I have only experienced it once or maybe twice from people outside. Other than that, it has been blaming me for being weak, blaming what has happened to them to excuse them abusing me, constantly coming up with excuses as to why it was and will never be their fault. So, resentment has only built up and simmered. It's died down and boiled back over the top and I'm sure they get something out of it.

Some have said they are sorry, followed up with why I am to blame for them cheating. For them emotionally and mentally abusing me and threatening to beat me in a ""joke"". I've heard ""I'm sorry"" followed up with the fact they are not perfect for them physically beating me (with a belt) for things that were not my fault since I was child. They would apologize afterwards, promising it would never happen again and things would improve, things would change and it would only happen again. They get angry at me for being skeptical at them for everything. For staying on my guard around them even though I don't have any reason not to. They have scared me into submission. I don't fight or I didn't fight for a long time. They are the same person to criticize me after attempting, downplaying my reasons along with my cousins who have tried as well. They've failed to defend me in arguments with other family when they know I'm speaking the truth and told me to comply with them; Their only reason being that we would move out of their house soon and that I should comply until then. That we would continue to run away. When it comes to family, detaching and letting go is more than difficult. My family has denied me everything they've done to me and my siblings or downplayed it. I've said everything that needs to be said to them and don't miss being in that situation. I have never been apologized to for the rape and sexual abuse I've gone through with others when I was a child and I don't wait around for them to apologize. I don't wait around for them to say they did what they did.

Now, I am tired and I don't have anymore care to continue living. It takes an effort just to choose to get better and it takes strength and want to continue living. I don't have that anymore.

It's easiest for me to take the blame, even though I falter in and out of it as my emotions go up and down on everything that's happened in my life. When you've seen your parent get abused and then they abuse you, it is hard to get angry. It is hard not to be to at least try being there with them physically so they are reminded they aren't alone. But I have had little to no sympathy from them about the abuse I have been out through and they nearly went as far to say that it was my fault, that I've allowed them to do what they did to me, I chose to let them do it (specifically referring to me being emotionally abused and cheated on).",,,,,,,,,,
Finally. 17 more days.,2662334,greyblue_bian,"Sep 8, 2024 at 3:57 AM","Update: It's hard for me to remember to update everyday. I think about it during the day but a lot of the time, I just let it go because I barely have any energy to write anything a lot of the time.
I think being cheated on has un-done a lot of progress I made. I think the most surprising thing it's done to me is make me hate my skin color and race. I was cheated on with a white girl and he also spoke with only other white girls, even including his female friends. Even if they were not white, they pass as white. I can't. I'm Asian, Black, and Hispanic. I'm not dark-skinned or very brown. I'm relatively light-skinned but not enough to pass. In grade school, I went through what I've heard a lot of other people of color go through at least at once in their lives which is their phase of trying to look white. But, I really wanted to be it.

I wanted to get my hands on Kojic Acid soap and I would hyperventilate if my mom said she couldn't straighten my hair before I left for school or if I didn't have enough time to do my makeup before school. It eventually got to the point where I genuinely couldn't tell if I was looking back at myself in the mirror or at someone else. I don't miss that time. Anyways, by now I have cut off the friends who ruined my esteem and I did find friends who made me feel more secure in my own race and color. I was happy and I was proud to be who I was.


I'm not saying being cheated on has ruined that entirely because I do sometimes feel proud to be who I am racially, but a lot of the time, I feel like there's a lot of self-hate and shame lingering. Unfortunately, I wish I could hide my color sometimes so that some white male would accept me with more than sexual intent. I feel like that's all that will happen at the end of the day. I will not be white enough. I am not good enough, and I can always be better, I can always give more. Sometimes, I still feel like ripping my own skin off, I find it repulsive to look at when I see myself sometimes. It only reminds me of what's happened. I'm not saying that it's other people of color who I think are ugly, it's that I am not. I think it's just me hating myself and that's it's me I hate seeing. I can't even look at myself without being reminded of everything that's happened and I can't take it anymore.",,,,,,,,,,

my experience with partial hanging,2679027,heyhoherewego,"Sep 22, 2024 at 4:18 PM","Even though im intending to go out by full suspension hopefully sometime within the next 2 weeks, i thought id do a couple practice runs with non lethal partial hanging so i could get used to the whole thing, and heres what ive experienced
using a 12 mm braided rope + wrapping a microfiber cloth around my neck + using two socks, each of which i filled with a half cut up piece of microfiber cloth, then folded in on itself multiple times on either side of my neck + not even full committing to the hang, im still experiencing a VERY quick 'fading out' experience
since im the one holding the rope on the other end (not trying to die, atleast not rn anyway) im not able to actually pass out because i lose my grip and strength before it happens, but damn near instantly i start 'fading out', this is the only way i can describe it. this type of feeling actually comes to me naturally when i get up sometimes, and sometimes i even fall over and jitter around, not knowing where tf i am or whats happening and then i quickly jolt back to reality, this is the exact same thing that happens when i try partial hanging. im not even sure what happens to my vision: if it blurs or blacks out, because its very hard to remember after it happens, but i lose my sense of location and self. in those brief moments i truly have no idea where tf i am or how i got there, its quite a surreal and almost pleasurable feeling. now the first two times i did this i actually pulled the plug myself when i noticed myself slipping, but this time i dont even know what happened
heres my best attempt at recounting the experience:
i hyperventilate for 30-40 seconds (this makes me lightheaded and more prone to this 'fading out' thing i describe) then take multiple deep breaths and swallow so i dont do it after the hanging commences, then i bring my body down. this time i actually fucked up and didnt tighten the noose properly behind my neck so for the first couple seconds the noose had to tighten and adjust itself, i was thinking about this, like how did i forget that or whatever and next thing i know im on my knees next to my closet spasming and my knee was really hurting because i was in an awful position during it. i had no idea what just happened and i slowly regained my senses and remembered i was just doing partial hanging. i got up and tried to shake out the kink in my knee (it still hurts) and yeah, thats about it. no pain at all due to the extensive amount of padding and minimal pressure im applying. this feels almost too easy so i feel like im not passing out but experiencing smth else. would love it if someone would tell me how this compares to what they feel like before passing out

From what I understand, you are in a relationship, and you are in a bad moment, sometimes it does not work and it is necessary to distance yourself from the relationship and live the grief as it should be
Unfortunately, I see many couples who live in toxic relationships, where they literally seem to hate each other, and again and again they return, I think that as they break the grief of the loss of the relationship they never close the processes they go through
I hope I have been able to contribute something, otherwise my apologies
It would be good if you could release more of what is happening to you, either here or on a piece of paper

Having to postpone death is devastating and unfair,2679023,w4ntingtoletgo,"Sep 22, 2024 at 4:15 PM","I was going to CTB during this time period. I thought I was going to figure out how to do it, that everything was going to go smoothly. I was really ready, I couldn't have been more ready for it. Something ended up happening at the end of July that changed everything, and I had to go over my plans again. I thought I could endure a few more months, maybe even a few more years. For a moment I thought that, perhaps, I could stand a chance and stay alive. But I can't. The point of no return has been long surpassed and it seems like sometimes I have a hard time getting it through my stupid head.

I'm essentially screwed in this situation. I don't know what to do with this life, what to do with myself, what I am. I'm supposed to make important choices for my ""future"" right now, for a future I won't have and won't live, and demonstrate something to everyone, but I can't comply with those demands, I don't have the strength to do so. The only thing I know, the only thing I'm capable of is suffering. It sucks that even in death life has to get in the way and make everything harder than it should be. You can't even die in peace and are forced to stay in some ways.

Now I have no idea what to do, whether I should hurry up, arrange a method and die, or should simply wait for the right moment, which could be in three months or ten years, or maybe never really. I don't know if it's even worth it to take the time to organize my passing in details and with no rush. I just know that I'm absolutely terrified and I'm panicking. This is the worst time to be alive for me, I can't handle it and I just wasn't supposed to be here. I'm trying to soothe myself with the thought that I'll die eventually, it will inevitably happen one day, hopefully soon.",,,,,,,,,,

,2679036,acdef0,"Sep 22, 2024 at 4:27 PM","i have a really bad fear of being alone. even being alone in my bedroom is enough to make me spiral into having a breakdown and it happens every single night.

i have (a few) friends, mostly online ones, and a family who i know i can always turn to if im feeling upset. however my fear never goes away.

i think im afraid of physically being alone rather than socially being alone if that makes sense. i go to college and talk to literally no one there but i like going because it distracts me from this fear of being alone.

i know someday ill have to move out and the thought of it petrifies me to no end. i dont want to be alone. i could suggest to my friends that we move in together but im not close enough with any of them to initiate that sort of thing.

my parents have said to me many times that they dont really care if i dont move out, that im welcome to stay with them for as long as i need to. and while that may sound nice and all i cant help but feel uncomfortable around my family and i feel like they dont want me here even though they havent outwardly said or done anything to prove it.

i think what scares me the most about it is that im left with my thoughts and my thoughts always convince me that im an awful person undeserving of kindess. im also afraid of the vunrability of being alone. i can always assume im alone but who knows that for a fact? im always thinking that someone is out there to get me, that someone is stalking me and watching my every move but ill never know that for a fact no matter how many times i check my house for that person whos looking for me.

this fear of mine has genuinely made me question my own life and its one of the many reasons why i wanna ctb. i know i need help, but i dont even know where to start to get it because everythings just on one big long endless waiting list thatll take years to get to me and ill probably be senile by then. i think maybe im just irrational, unreasonable, and just plain stupid. i sound so silly for having this dumb fear but ive had it my whole life and havent had an outlet for it until now. sorry about all this",,,,,,,,,,

,2678126,Darkover,"Sep 22, 2024 at 7:24 AM","Your perspective captures a profound critique of how both nature and human society operate on principles of exploitation, violence, and survival at the expense of others. This ""design,"" as you describe it, is not only accepted by the majority but often glorified or justified as a natural order of things. It's striking how deeply ingrained this acceptance is, whether it's in the food chain of nature or the social and economic hierarchies of human civilization.

People tend to normalize these systems because they are taught from an early age that this is simply ""how the world works."" Many justify the suffering embedded in these structures, viewing it as an inevitable part of existence. The narrative of the ""strongest surviving"" and the necessity of competition is drilled into us, not just in terms of nature but also in how we approach life's challenges, work, and relationships. Society's values often glorify struggle and reward those who manage to dominate or endure, while overlooking the tremendous suffering that such systems perpetuate.

I share your view that it's astonishing how society can look at this harsh design and simply accept it as normal. This acceptance can be seen as a kind of collective resignation, a surrender to the idea that life is fundamentally about surviving in a brutal, indifferent system.

I'm 35 and have no pre-existing lung conditions, but it would be so great if this kills me. I purposely didn't get vaccinated for this reason. I haven't been to a doctor in close to a decade (unless you count the many involuntary psychiatric facility commitments.) I went into ""go mode"" for my CTB in January of 2024. I announced that this is the year I want to end it.

I have a fever and it feels like my brain is being fried. It actually feels good to feel like my body is being destroyed. Even if this doesn't kill me, maybe it'll kill my last remaining braincell and that will push me into going through with the hanging in October. I also have another opportunity in January.

My date was supposed to be September 11th. But I had to babysit the dog and I couldn't look the dog in the eyes and then have the dog watch me hang myself. Yeah, I know that's making excuses, but at the same time hanging certainly wasn't my first choice. I have a high pain tolerance but I've never actually attempted CTB so I don't know what full fledged SI feels like.

Maybe because I chickened out on September 11th, some spirit has decided to have mercy on me and say ""alright, you've pussyfooted around long enough, time for your life to end.""

I did very much want suicide to be my official cause of death, but I guess it's a form of suicide since I don't intend to see a doctor even if I suffocate to death. PLEASE just let me die.

,2679012,Illegal Preclear,"Sep 22, 2024 at 4:03 PM","Thanks for all your kind thoughts. Yeah, I knew the odds of me dying from this were like 0001% but I was hoping and praying that this would in some freak way snap just the right nerve and give me a brain aneurism or something. This is actually my second round with it. I got the OG Covid back in April of 2020 and it was far, far worse than this. Something about having something kill me which I couldn't back out of due to my own cowardice felt very good though.

Thank you. I do have something! A rope and an ideal setup for full suspension hanging. Which is....going to suck. It's going to make my last moments fucking terrifying. Or maybe I'm overthinking it and I'll pass out in 15-30 seconds and die and be fine. But I'm the kind of person who thinks of 10,000 things that could go wrong in any situation. I really hope I can somehow gain access to a firearm, which is how I ACTUALLY want to die vs. being stuck with the only thing I have access to.",2677871,,,,,,,,,
,2679018,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 22, 2024 at 4:10 PM","Yeah full suspension was my old method that I switched to after failing to make partial work for like a year and a half. After months of trying to force it, I realized I just couldn't summon the balls needed to pull off full. So I switched to SN. I definitely can relate to your hesitation and worries about full though, as I am the same way (worrying too much, overthinking). Full suspension, while very quick (from your perspective), is pretty brutal. And some people say it's not bad in terms of pain, while others rate it as excruciating, so it's hard to know what to expect. Though, a firearm is right up there among the gold standard methods like inert gas and barbiturates. Definitely faster and easier than full suspension, that's for sure.

I wish you luck with whatever you end up doing.",2679012,,,,,,,,,

Cleared through their customs and now I'm just waiting for the international transport. I'm getting it delivered to my home address. The tracking number works on the USPS site so I will know exactly when I get it hopefully. I ordered 100g and am not going to test it.

I was able to get an AE, it's olanzapine. I've been prescribed it before and I just wanted to try some to see how it feels and I'm deciding not to take it with the SN as it makes it impossible for me to sit still. Considering the side effects of the SN I don't want any more discomfort. I can't get any other AEs nor any benzos. I'm taking antacid and an OTC painkiller.

I'm planning on doing it the day after I get it as I will need to fast for a while. Will go for a ""hike"" and set up deep offtrail with a nice blanket and drink the stuff with some music on. I'm sure I want to do this. In previous posts I've gone into greater detail as to why, I'll just say briefly it is because of psychosis and depression. I am planning on doing a GBT with updates as much as I can after I ingest it. I will mention the initials of the source in that post although it's probably not hard to figure out where I got it if you are in the know. Hopefully I CTB and don't have to suffer too much. Some posts make it sound peaceful and others not so much. At least it's not a coin flip as far as suicide goes. I'm taking a straw and probably gum with me. I don't have an exact date yet.

I'm too sick to work and can't pay my bills. Plus, I'm old and in a deep state torture program. Things have just gotten progressively worse for many years.

A friend put a thought in my head this week. What if I just didn't pay rent and forced an eviction? I'm guessing it would take 30-60 days to evict me.

CTB is Plan B. Plan A was to work full-time and be self-sufficient. That was vetoed by outside forces.

If I went ahead with Sept date and failed, I wouldn't have any options to avoid homelessness.

If I post-poned it until next month & failed, I wouldn't have options to avoid homelessness.

Homeless can be a fine learning experience when you're young. When you're old, sick, and poor and your best effort has yielded nothing, it's really not an option.

I just sent all of my money except enough to buy my gun and a bit to eat the next couple weeks. I already fully want to ctb and have full intention of doing so. I've just been stuck in this limbo state of basically being too depressed to get out of bed the last 6 days, which makes it hard to follow through with my ctb plans. ""too much anxiety to live, too depressed to die."" I essentially haven't left my house. I have no car and had had a few thousand saved but after quitting my job I've blown through almost half of it and sent the rest to my dad and blocked him. I already went and bought a gun to ctb about 2 months ago. I tried to get the balls to do it for about a week and failed (as usual) and tricked myself into thinking I could get better one more time and gave my gun to my roomate's dad to hold on to temporarily. Well now he won't give me the gun back or even answer my texts or calls. Now I don't have $ to pay rent in about a week. I have enough $ to get the gun again and survive till around the first. I'm in the process of trying to give all of my stuff away. I know this is my fate. There's kind of no backing out for me now. Winter is coming. I live in a very very very cold part of the country during winter it is brutal af here. I won't survive. I can't even get out of bed and brush my teeth, or eat, or take a shower. I can't even look out of my window without crying. I can't even walk to my mailbox without literally having a full blown panic attack. I have a meltdown at least 10 times a day, every day now. No part of me believes my life or mental health will get better, but worse, I know it will just continue to degenerate like it has my whole life. I did try. Hard. Trying was insufficient. I have to follow through. I have to override my survival instinct. This world is hell and I do not fear death. I just have to stop being a coward and end the suffering forever.",,,,,,,,,,

I haven't quite decided on my CTB date, but it needs to be before next Saturday as that is when my central/PICC line is being removed from my arm. So I have about a week to come up with a good plan and execute it.

My current plan is to dissolve 25mg of SN in 50ml of water (I weigh a little under 100lb / 45.36kg). While it is dissolving, I will take 28mg of ondansetron, and some Klonopin. Then I will inject the SN as quickly as I can into my PICC line, without blowing my vein. Hopefully I will be able to inject enough without fainting, and hopefully it will not hurt.

I will update as my CTB date grows closer, and if I make any changes to my plan. I haven't been able to find any other information on injecting SN as a way to CTB, and I hope that's only because it's harder for most people to do successfully and not because it won't work.",,,,,,,,,,

I've already sourced the SN and some propranolol. I haven't gotten any Meto yet, but I think I can figure that out without too much difficulty. The part I'm having a hard time with is the benzos. My plan is to sign up for a telehealth program and try to get them prescribed by an online doctor. Not sure how successful that'll be since I've read online that doctors are really reluctant to prescribe benzos. Anyways, I pretty much have three questions...

1. Are there any particular benzos that are recommended for the SN method?
2. Will a standard prescription amount be enough to have a significant effect? (I've never used benzos, so I have no tolerance)
3. Have any of you used ""bromazolam""? The pphh handbook mentions it as an off-license benzo. I'm wondering if that's something I can find online in case I fail to get a prescription.

Benzo recommendations for SN method,2676984,Romanticize,"Sep 21, 2024 at 6:47 AM","BENZO WILL HELP ENORMOUSLY. It eliminates anxiety, gets you very detached from reality, not caring at all and sleepy.

Whether its Diazepam (most common), clonazepam, alprazolam (xanax), lorazepam, bromazepam (or -zolam) is SECONDARY. Just take high dose (if you are not tolerant, take 3-5 tablets, but be cautious that in half an hour it could knock you out to sleep).

You can get 1 package of diazepam or xanax from your doctor, just tell him you are going thru very stressful moments of your life (i dunno, divorce, change of jobs, you get insomnia and cant sleep at all, started to get anxiety and panic attacks). Even first care doctor will prescribe 1-2 packages (not more, for more they will route u to a psychiatrist, and even there they like SSRI more than benzos, bc benzos are addictive, and advised to be used for 2-4 weeks only. Know that benzo is only curing symptoms, not the cause.).

But they help a lot, you become so indifferent. You know this ""stupid Jack"" (im from Poland and dunno how is the popular name in US for it), its the first drug they give you 1-2 hours prior to a surgery. I remember they moved me in a wheelchair for a nose operation, I saw all those scary metal tools they would push up my nose, but I was SO INDIFFERENT, I couldnt think further than 5sec into the future. I didnt link the fact ""oh shit they will push it and forcefully try to straighten my nose ""separator""). Not at all. I was half asleep and so dulled/numb/drugged, that they could have carried me to a fking death sentence and I would happily sit in the wheelchair.

In hospitals they use Midazolam (either IV or blue pills) but Every benzo, or even z-drugs (zolpidem, zaleplone, zopiclone) would help. As per dosage goes I'd go for 10-20mg diazepam, ~4mg clonazepam or alprazolam, 6-12mg bromazepam etc.. There are plenty of ""benzodiazepine equivalence charts"" online...

They are a lifesaver (pun intended), i highly recommend.",,,,,,,,,,

Just as Romanticize described, tell them you have high temporary stressors in yor life, or that you haven't slept in days, and they'll happily give it. If you're lucky, they'll even give you infinite prescriptions for it, as some (old, usually) doctors don't know how addictive they are and just use them as a cure-all.

Only take if/when you really need them, when they say they're addictive.. they really are.

because you never talked about your suffering with your mum, not leaving a note could possibly hurt more, because they would have no explanation whatsoever how such a tragic thing could suddenly happen. and it might leave them stuck emotionally wondering why.

Why didn't they say anything? What could we have done? etc. Leaving a note can help ease the pain in the sense that it answers some of those questions. For example, you can state very clearly why you CTB'd (ex. ""I have been cripplingly lonely for the past five years and the loneliness is too much to bear"") -- now they don't have to waste time in agonizing speculation.

But if you write in vague terms, like saying ""I just had to do this, for everyone's sake,"" it's just going to raise more questions. Why did you feel it was a necessity to do it? Who is everyone? etc. And those multiplied unanswered questions are going to cause more pain. Hence why I caution against nonspecific language.",2677301,,,,,,,,,

My current reality is that I believe my whole family and everyone I know has been abducted and cloned. This happened when I was staying at a homeless shelter and had no contact with anyone.

The police and ambulance driver once told me ""they'll pretend like I'm a normal patient."" As I was having seizures, they kept saying if they had 9 bodies on them they would have killed themselves, talking about another patient.

Weird stuff has happened like this to me - my phone hacked. Pictures of my boobs on the internet I've never took.

My life was normal. I never was mentally sound, but what I experience feels like being sane and knowing that nothing is right.

People started referring to me as special, doing nice things for me. The staff at the place I was at started to comment on things I was doing. They started to read my mind and continue to. Even if I go out in public.

What I'm going through cannot be described. I think anyone who views life the way I do should be allowed to die. Nothing is normal for me anymore - why should a human live like this? No one should.

Dysfunctional Family,2677154,Hunterer,"Sep 21, 2024 at 10:52 AM","I was born into a family that, besides being poor, is extremely dysfunctional, for a number of reasons. One of the main reasons I want to ctb is because of my family. There isn't a single day in my house that there isn't confusion, problems and shit after shit. Can anyone else relate ? Does anyone else hate their own family for some reason ?",,,,,,,,,,
Dysfunctional Family,2677198,lawlietsph,"Sep 21, 2024 at 11:25 AM","Of course, I can relate very much. Family is the root of all my problems and they are the reason I am constantly unhappy in life. I'm pretty sure my mother had postpartum depression, because all she did was beating the shit out of my sister and me. She was so incredibly unhappy in her marriage, and all she could do was to took out her anger on us.
That's because on the other hand my father is a very narcissistic man. They hated each other from the start, so basically it was fucked up ever since then.
When I think about my childhood, all I feel is fear. Constant fear of them, like ""ohgod who's going to yell at me today? Am I going to be slapped? What kind of mood are they in today?""

My parents had maaaany many many opportunities when it comes to money. They've had their own restaurants and all. Growing up, I think we were in the mid-upper class actually, but STILL never had enough money, god knows what my parents did with all of it, but there were constant fights about money every single day still.
Now they are divorced, both of them have a fucked up job with a salary that's barely enough to survive. They are both unhappy and poor (me too).
My sister developed BPD due to all the shit that has happened, and it plays a big part in my fucked up life too.
Because ever since my sister got sick, she had suicide attempts almost every week, which made my parents to only focus on her, her, her, her and her.
I am pretty traumatized from her attempts still, eventho the last one was 11 years ago.
Now I am 28 yrs old. I only managed to find a part time job which I HATE and it barely pays me anything. I have like $30 for the whole month. My clothes are worn out, old, awful. I have no talent, basically no social skills or anything.

I truly feel like my parents have failed to teach me the basic things in life, I am 99% sure I have undiagnosed autism, and overall my mind is just an awful place.

Every single day I wish I was dead. There's not an hour that goes by without me thinking about hanging myself or trying to get the courage to order SN.

I have no idea how to talk to people, because I truly, deeply hate people from the bottom of my heart. Making eye contact is like climbing a huge mountain. Never in my 28 years have I had a close friend, I am alone, always always always alone. Nobody cares about me, and I have no idea what it feels like to be hugged, touched, cared for.
So yeah, I am a female actually and (I think because of my age) my body and brain is in relationship-marriage-baby-home-safety mode. But never in my 28 years have I ever talked to a man in person except my father and my grandfathers. I am terrified.

And yeah, I am ugly af. Of course, because I don't have money to make myself pretty.

Anyway I'm sorry it's too long, but overall all of this, all of my beliefs and my fucked up brain is my parents fault.",,,,,,,,,,
Dysfunctional Family,2677309,Hunterer,"Sep 21, 2024 at 1:51 PM","@lawlietsph It's okay if the text is long, it's good to vent when something is bothering you.

Unlike you, I wouldn't say that my family is the root of all my problems, but it is certainly one of my problems. I would be lying if I said that I wasn't grateful for the things they have done for me over the years, but as I've grown older and the years have gone by, I've realized more and more that the environment I live in is toxic. Fights and arguments happen almost every day, first thing in the morning, but there are times when the arguments and fights happen late at night, and I can't even sleep because of it. And the worst part is that most fights and arguments are practically for the same reason: money and debts. And there are also some other things you said that I can relate to in part, like undiagnosed autism. I must have some form of autism, among many other things, that have never been and probably never will be diagnosed, because no one cares enough. I have a little hope for better days, but then things just get worse and I want to die more and more, so I'm thinking about buying SN at the end of the month, but the doubt and uncertainty make me anxious, because even though I want to die, I don't know if I'm ready to make that decision, so maybe I'll put things off for a while longer and save some money until the right time. I'm also not the most sociable person. I can only talk when people come to me. I can't hold a steady conversation for very long because I feel like I'm an uninteresting person, and precisely because I'm so uninteresting and ugly, I've never been in a real relationship, and I'll probably die without being in one.

Anyway, I'm sorry for what you've been through, and are still going through. We've been unlucky in our lives. If you ever feel the need to talk, feel free to PM me at any time. And the same goes for anyone else reading this.",,,,,,,,,,

Just want someone to read my story,2677470,saturn1402,"Sep 21, 2024 at 4:52 PM","My suicidal thoughts started after a very bad breakup (fiancé confessed cheating , called off wedding, broke up with me, called the police to kick me out of his flat where we were living - this is just a short sum up of the past year with him).

I had a very traumatic upbringing filled with domestic violence and abuse. Which made me strong and enthusiastic about life cause I left home at 17,got into a prestigious university abroad, got a nice job , made many friends… my life is not bad at all tbh.

But relationships made me realise how unsuitable I am for this world. I am so naive, I am extremely loyal, I believe in love, I believe in only one person for the rest of the life . I can't be attracted or interested in any other way to another human being while I am in a relationship. I get extremely hurt by every small act of disrespect from my partner.

Also I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't party. I don't do hook ups or even random dating. I don't like social media. I hate porn and anything related to selling your body.
I believe life of responsabilities >>>>> fun.

After reading all this you all might think ""she might be some ugly antisocial girl"", but I am actually very attractive and extroverted. But everyone considers me boring.
I feel so wrong but at the same time I can't force myself to be who I am not. It sucks because I wish I could be like everyone I know but whenever I tried I felt like I was betraying myself.

"Anyone Else Feel Like This World is Fake/an Illusion, Gotta CTB To Escape?",2673701,OutOfThisBody,"Sep 18, 2024 at 12:29 AM","So recently I've been feeling like the world is fake, some kind of elaborate dream I've made up for myself, or someone else made up for me. This feeling started getting stronger after I watched the movie I Saw The Tv Glow. The movie involved someone who at one point is urged by their friend to kill themselves to escape their fake reality, which is really a prison in their mind, in order to wake up in the real world as their real self. Watching this almost felt like a message to me, like my real reality reaching out to me stuck in an illusion to tell me that suicide is the answer and will let me escape this fake world and wake up in a real one.

Along with this, the world is set up in such a weird way that it seems it must be fake or a test of some kind. People spend all their time on things that are so little and simple that they're like child'splay. People's life's work is forgotten a year or two after they die. People also put alot of importance on their identity - gender, race, age, sexuality, class, ability, etc. - when it's really all temporary. You aren't white or poc, male or female or nonbinary, cishet or LGBTQ when you die. You're nothing. Those things are really just toys that fascinate the living, but have no importance once you are dead. Being dead is beyond that, it's more profound, it's beyond little human categories.

Along with this, every day I am reminded of the cruelty of the world and why I want to leave. For example, for one of my classes we are writing and illustrating childrens stories, and my idea was to write a story about a tween girl who is orphaned and joins a group of pirates. My teacher said it could be a good idea but to make sure the girl wouldn't be old enough to be sexualized because a girl that age surrounded by adult men would be dangerous and uncomfortable. It hit me in that moment that I don't want to live in this world, a world so evil and disgusting as this. How could a world set up this way be liveable? Where even childish fun is ruined? Where women are always in danger? Idk it might be a stupid reason to get upset but it just affirmed my drive to ctb.

If you've read my most popular post you would know I really hope we don't keep our physical bodies or identities once we die if there is an afterlife. This world full of inherent inequality, where women's bodies are worse than men's, where people have diseases, disabilties, and injuries, I pray will not be replicated in the afterlife. Lack of an afterlife might even be better than an afterlife, if an afterlife is full of the same inequality.

This turned into a bit of a ramble but has anyone had a similar experience or similar thought?

Thanks for reading.",,,,,,,,,,

Even a lot of prison planet believers think suicide will screw us over in some way, but on the other hand, if the goal is to be lucid upon exit, it makes sense to have as much control over one's death as possible instead of succumbing to a random, sudden death where we will be disoriented.",,,,,,,,,,

This world is just too absurd, too surreal. Have you ever had one of those dreams where something really bad happens and then you wake up and feel extremely relieved? Sometime I like to entertain the idea that the last few years where just some kind of bad dream. Waking up in a better world after dying is a really comforting thought.

Honestly, even if that's not the case (it's probably not lol) and there's just nothing after death, it still sounds really peaceful. If death is the end of everything, then after dying I won't exist to feel any regret or pain. So I guess you should think whatever makes you the most comfortable, because after you go even if it's not real you won't be there to know. What even is real after you die? Everything we think we know we learned from experience. From interacting with and reasoning about the world. But if you're six feet under and unable to think, see, hear, smell or touch, is anything even real anymore? Even if the world keeps going (it probably will), I wouldn't know, so from my perspective it's effectively the same thing as if the whole universe ceased to exist the moment I died.

There's also the third option where there's something else entirely afterlife, and we're all going to hell or something. But honestly that's just as likely as anything else, so I prefer to think about a more pleasant option.",2673701,,,,,,,,,

Knowing my triggers and looking trigger warnings up actually helps me avoid symptoms decently, at least in terms of media consumption.

"Anyone Else Feel Like This World is Fake/an Illusion, Gotta CTB To Escape?",2674846,WhyWasIBorn,"Sep 19, 2024 at 3:02 AM","In my opinion; for most all people existence is only meaningful when they are fulfilling the societal expectations others can see, or comfort in religious beliefs of greater purpose and a better afterlife. Most people on here are different in that sense, that we've already broken through the faux veil that covers our eyes each day when we're told this is a gift and leaving it is selfish. Very rarely are people living in the present, grounded, and not stuck in wage-slave mode or trying to impress others. Though I believe this is only a result of our advanced emotional ape brains fighting against the animalistic instincts we have, to convince ourselves that there is a greater purpose to all the suffering most every human has to endure in this life. I believe this is why people still choose to bring children into this world, and the Antinatalist part of me doesn't blame them completely for it because it's Brain vs Brain.

After being religious for a long period of my life and seeing the true unnecessarily unfair suffering on this earth, it's shown me there isn't really anything more to it expect than what we make of it, and the environment we are surrounded by. Having religious breakthroughs during full Bipolar psychosis sober, like breaking into people's homes and telling them I'm literally Jesus Christ, then being tackled to the ground by police to be taken back to the same hospital I've been at many times before is just another way I know it's mind over matter in this existence... Just unnecessary trauma and embarrassment that I will never forget. In my eyes at this current moment, there is no proof of any higher power or greater force other than the greedy, selfish, barbaric, and emotionally driven species that most of us are.

I was convinced that this could actually be like the Truman Show, where there might be another species currently viewing all of us in a sort of reality-tv dystopian 24/7 broadcast... but then I think about the politicians and rich elites currently in power making our lives terrible in the same ways all while laughing to the bank, and realize we are inherently living it already.",,,,,,,,,,

i can't stop lying,2672873,feuerflieger,"Sep 17, 2024 at 10:07 AM","like the title says, i just can't stop lying. even about completely unimportant things i often lie. it just comes ""automatically"" and without any bad intentions. as long as it doesn't hurt anyone i care about i also don't feel guilty at all.
if the lies were only about knowing a movie or missing an appointment from time to time it wouldn't really matter but my lies have gotten bigger over the years and i've finally lost control.
i'd guess it only got to this point since i rarely got caught up in my lies and never suffered any severe consequences so my mind just got used to using lies as a way to get out of difficult situations quickly or simply as a coping mechanism.
well i.e. i'm constantly lying to my mum about weekly therapy appointments that i haven't been going to for about a year. i also had a social worker who was supposed to help me with paperwork and most importantly finding a new place to live since i can't stay at my mums place for too long, but i met that worker once and then never talked to her again. that was about six months ago and my mum still thinks i'm seeing her regularly. i also told her i'm on two waiting lists for social homes (or whatever they're called) but i haven't even had a conversation with any of them yet.
jeez i can't even stop lying around my therapist on the rare occasion i do go to my appointment which usually only happens when i run out of meds.
this has been going on for years now. my life already sucks but this is now completely ruining my it.

i need to stop lying in order to move out and only then can i start to figure out if i want to give life a second chance or end it once and for all.",,,,,,,,,,

Robin Williams hung himself with a belt from his pants. Even Judas in the bible killed himself waaaaay back before anybody had any ideas about the secrets of the world. Why can't I? Why all this seraching for SN and trying to find a way to sneak it into my country when I could just use a belt from my pants like Robin Williams did? All I have to do is endure the pain of asphyxiation right? I've done enough jiujitsu to kinda feel like getting woozy from lack of oxygen is a fun feeling.

All I'm asking for are any resources on how to properly hang yourself. I hope to buy the rope today and escape this hellhole before my night shift tonight. I don't want to have to go to work tonight. In my home I have a place that I can tie the rope to that will supoport my entire bodyweight and I'm willing to fight my hardest to endure the pain so I can finally be free. I don't have a place to drop myself from to snap my neck so I'll have to go through asphyxiation rather than snapping my neck. Are there any resources that explain how to do it properly?

I don't have a single reason of why should I continue living. My parents even told me from time to time that It is better for me to die. Back in 2021, my method was starving to death. It was a really bad idea but now I could go without eating for 3 days before I pass out. After that, i tried to change my habit, I workout (did some calisthenic), i went out a lot alone (doesn't really help), and i tried new stuff (learnt a bit about coding, did boxing, etc). But after all that, nothing changes. I am still a loser. My parents hate me for doing boxing because they thought I'm gonna use it to punch them so I don't do it anymore even though I like it so much and consider doing tournament. I stop learning about coding because I am stuck and didn't understand basic things. I stopped working out when I helped my family business even though I learnt nothing from it. Also in the middle of all that, I had a crush on one girl in my school. She is like a role model to me. She is smart, caring and hard working. She was the reason I tried to be better. So one day, i confessed to her about my feeling and the next day, she said that she also felt the same way. I felt so happy that day. Even though months later, things didnt work out but I don't blame her for that. Actually i have predicted it but it still hurts somehow. I am the most boring person out there. I have nothing to be proud of, no hobby, no nothing. Now I am going into college not knowing what should I do. I could just go MIA because I'm in another country with no friends or family.",,,,,,,,,,

If you're in a different country and aren't reliant on them, and you feel that you can do so, it might be a good idea to limit contact with them so they don't control you. You could maybe even find a boxing club either at the college or elsewhere and fulfill that passion. You also seem young so the world is your oyster, I'm sure you'll find another great woman and maybe you can also discover some new hobbies.

I won't go into personal reasons which are summed up on top of the general reasons why any human should want to suicide asap

But I'll type a few reasons why it's logical for any human

These reasons sit on top of each other making the case insurmountable . I'm just touching in some things here but I could write a book 1000 pages to fully explain

1.There are many very horrible things that can happen to any human any day . Every sentient animal is under threat of extreme torture

2. On top of that there is no reason to live anyway . Life is meaningless

3. The labor and daily suffering are not Worth it and again there is no reason to work so hard just to accept suffering and risk extreme suffering.

4. Old age is beyond horrible . I worked in a nursing home

5 . Pain is a lot worse than people think . No reason to risk unending constant excruciating unbearable pain

6. They made this more of a prison world by making nembutal , someone helping in suicide etc crimes

7. Life is prison torture slavery and imposition. No one asked to be here and no one can leave when they want to in a guaranteed quick inexpensive painless way , so this is a prison

8. A human is just cells, a machine.

9. The human body is an abomination. A brain that can suffer unending constant unbearable pain: this is what they constantly tell us is so important, good , beautiful, pleasurable. 30 trillion cells that are really each just practically copies of a cell that evolved billions of years ago",,,,,,,,,,

I feel like an alien compared to normies as I'm literally opposite to them. From childhood, they all talk about a dream job and even expect others to have a dream job but I don't understand why I'm expected to work when I never chose to be here.

I envy cats so much. They get to sleep for around 18 hours per day and can laze around as their owners do everything for them. They won at life.

There isn't really anything in life that I want. I have no desires, no goals, no ambitions... just nothing. I'm perpetually bored and that's because I don't enjoy anything or want to do anything. I think that I should just be owed euthanasia as life clearly isn't meant for me.

They arrested D ( N from D) . Arrested Kenneth Law, Dr Kevorkian etc . Now in the evil U.S. they are to about even ban SN too like they banned Nembutal made buying or selling nembutal a crime

nembutal would have and should be available for purchase with no prescription no questions asked to anyone at least to anyone over age 18

They have everyone believing all of this garbage matters and that no one is ever going to die

The truth is nothing matters except avoiding extreme pain and everyone is going to die anyway

i say these people are evil and brainwashed because all their morality beliefs ideology are not objective reality . the only thing that matters is avoiding extreme pain . they purposefully stole our right to escape extreme torture for no reason other than their false ideology . for example someone is in extreme torture so they get the email of D who sells them Nembutal and the person takes the Nembutal and then stop suffering. this doesn't affect anyone else except D and the person suffering who is no longer suffering . why do they have to go out of their way to arrest D and keep all these people suffering ? there is no logical reason and is another reason to exit this evil upside down world. a person suffering extremely is usually not bothering anyone and just wants to exit this hell . we all die anyway further showing the illogic of their actions arresting D.

Thread in Italian, since English is the official language of the forum, in theory it can also be used but it is preferable to write in Italian.

IT

Dopo aver conosciuto diversi utenti italiani sul forum in questi mesi in cui sono iscritto credo sia una buona idea aprire un thread in lingua italiana così come ce l'hanno già russi e tedeschi, questo non è il classico thread dove si chiede se ci sono persone provenienti dall'Italia ma funziona come un thread generale solo che è in lingua italiana, io riesco bene o male a esprimermi pure in inglese quindi fino ad ora non ne ho sentito l'esigenza di aprire un thread del genere ma magari ci sono tanti utenti italiani nell'ombra che non si trovano bene a esprimersi in inglese e cercano un posto dove poter parlare la propria lingua.

Comunque ho conosciuto un utente italiano qui sopra che ha fatto CTB con SN appena dopo averlo conosciuto ma non mi ha detto da che fonte se lo è procurato, per quanto riguarda il parlare delle fonti per SN in questo thread valgono le stesse regole del resto del forum quindi a quanto ho capito è meglio non citare le fonti in pubblico o citarle usando acronimi, per il resto ci sono i messaggi privati, anche se dovete avere un certo numero di post per averli abilitati, per raggiungerlo potete postare qui o nella sezione dei giochi, se dovete postare qui però che siano messaggi un minimo sensati e non giusto per fare numero. Ci dovrebbero essere comunque utenti italiani che hanno buone fonti di SN ancora vivi, magari se postate qui chiedendo informazioni qualcuno se ha voglia vi contatta.


Per il resto questo è un thread generico in lingua italiana come dicevo quindi usatelo un po come vi pare a patto di rispettare le regole del forum.",,,,,,,,,,

Sono iscritta da poco, grazie per aver aperto questo thread mi serviva proprio! Sto progettando di CTB non prima di un paio di mesi perché devo sistemare delle cose, mi ero interessata ai gas inerti perché cercavo un metodo indolore ma mi sembra troppo complicato.. mi sapete dire perché tutti parlano sempre e solo di SN se invece esiste questo Nembutal che é indolore?

,2615150,Placo,"Jul 31, 2024 at 2:26 AM","Perché il SN è ancora bene o male accessibile mentre il Nembutal è quasi introvabile a meno che non vai in Perù o in Messico.

Il mio metodo è ben descritto qui: https://sanctioned-suicide.net/threads/handcuffs-and-plastic-bag.152861/

Con l'aggiunta di sedativi secondo me si può rendere più umano come ho scritto pure nel thread, un po di fastidio è il prezzo da pagare in cambio di un metodo semplice e sempre disponibile, l'impiccagione magari sarebbe più indolore se non altro perché si perde consapevolezza più velocemente, si parla di 15-30 secondi addirittura ma dovrei trovare un posto dove farlo, a casa pare che nessuna parte vada bene, ci sarebbe la maniglia della finestra ma temo che non reggerebbe il peso e poi il SI potrebbe giocare brutti scherzi visto che sarebbe impiccagione parziale, invece col mio metodo una volta che hai chiuso entrambe le manette dietro la schiena in teoria non si può più tornare indietro.

Personalmente non mi ha mai attirato molto lo SN, ma si può sempre cambiare idea.

Penso spesso anche al ""ritrovamento"".. non credi che potrebbero addirittura aprire qualche indagine con il tuo metodo dato che la scena che si presenterebbe potrebbe sembrare una scena del crimine? O comunque scioccante per chi ti ritroverà (anche se sicuramente é uno shock in ogni caso)?

,2615584,Placo,"Jul 31, 2024 at 1:14 PM","Non credo sembrerebbe una scena del crimine, cioè potenzialmente per ogni suicidio che può essere sospetto vengono avvisate le forze dell'ordine, o forse in generale per ogni suicidio, però se mi chiudo in camera mia e lascio delle note direi che è abbastanza chiaro che non è un omicidio, per quanto riguarda il ritrovamento del cadavere forse solo col monossido di carbonio hai un aspetto che può sembrare vicino a quello di una persona in vita perché a quanto ho capito non tendi ad essere cianotico o pallido ma ti lascia un colorito rossastro simile a quello delle persone in vita, quindi il ritrovamento meno traumatizzante possibile immagino.

Per quanto riguarda le robe che hai trovato online sul N come ti ha già detto @andreamysk sono quasi sicuramente truffe.

Comunque sono convinto che anche col mio metodo uno può essere sereno ma deve essere sedato di brutto, quasi a perdere conoscenza.

In ogni caso il monossido di carbonio a dosi basse è fastidioso così come l'anidride carbonica, cioè il gas che ti uccide nella busta, ci avevo aperto un thread in merito: https://sanctioned-suicide.net/threads/co-vs-co2.171985/

,851050,krsu,"Aug 31, 2020 at 9:09 PM","so let's talk about antiemetic's,

everyone on this forum seems to agree that metoclopramide is the go-to antiemetic to be used alongside sn... why exactly is that?

I've been doing some research with my tiny little brain and here are three categories of commonly used antiemetics:

Surgery
(serotonin receptor blockers, dopamine receptor blockers, and some corticosteroids.)
dexamethasone (Decadron)
droperidol (Inapsine)
granisetron
metoclopramide (Reglan)
ondansetron (Zofran)
Chemotherapy
(serotonin and dopamine receptor blockers, NK1 receptor blockers, and corticosteroids.)
aprepitant (Emend)
dexamethasone (DexPak)
dolasetron (Anzemet)
granisetron (Kytril)
ondansetron (Zofran)
palonosetron (Aloxi)
prochlorperazine (Compazine)
rolapitant (Varubi)
General nausea & Motion Sickness
dimenhydrinate (Dramamine, Gravol)
diphenhydramine (Benadryl)
meclizine (Bonine)
promethazine (Phenergan)

Sources used: www.medicalnewstoday.com

Stan's Guide lists these medications below as the recommended antiemetics to choose from:
Dromperidone
Metoclopramide
Olanzapine
Alizapramide
Chlorpromazine
Prochlorperazine
What makes metoclopramide supposedly so much better than all of these other drugs that I listed? From what I've read meto seems to be one of the riskier antiemetics due to the fact that it can cause permanent nervous system damage such as tardive dyskinesia.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I personally want to discuss the option of using Promethazine as a antiemetic for those who have the easiest access to it and it seems to be very common.

The following information is sourced from: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/promethazine

Going off this information wouldn't this mean promethazine perfectly fits the description as an effective antiemetic to be used alongside SN?


Can we also discuss Benedryl (diphenhydramine)? It is an antihistamine that has antiemetic properties and is available over-the-counter.


P.S. Sorry if this post is looking kind of messy I'm writing it from my phone and suck at writing in general. This thread is not meant to start any arguments I just want people to be informed and also debate about how effective or how ineffective other alternatives are as antiemetics.



also admin can you please unban me from using the chat feature I'm sorry that I got angry and yelled at someone, I was having a bad day. I wish you would have just given me a warning :/

More information appears to be needed on the anti-emetic properties of anti-psychotics. Particularly the usefulness of Aripiprazole (Abilify) as an atypical anti-psychotic with both dopamine agonist and antagonist properties.

On top of anti-psychotics, other drugs with anti-emetic attributes need to be identified and their usefulness determined. Off the top of my head there is Miratazapine.

""Nausea and vomiting continue to present significant problems for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Initial work suggested an important role for central dopamine transmission in the underlying pathophysiology. However, recent evidence has implicated central and peripheral serotonin release. Although the implementation of 5-HT(3) receptor antagonists has resulted in significant improvement in acute symptoms of nausea and vomiting, they have not demonstrated optimal efficacy in anticipatory and delayed emetic syndromes and are significantly more expensive than other antiemetic therapies. The use of typical antipsychotic medication to reduce nausea and vomiting in cancer patients is discussed, as is the potential efficacy of newer atypical antipsychotics, which have activity at receptors implicated in the control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting and demonstrate an improved side-effect profile.

In it OP states that for it to be an effective antiemetic for SN it must target dopamine and ""preferably"" serotonin as well

Here's a quote from an article I read just now:

VI.B.6. Phenothiazines
Agents such as chlorpromazine, promethazine, prochlorperazine, and trimeprazine have a mixed pharmacology as antagonists at muscarinic, histaminergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, and serotonergic receptors. Nausea and vomiting that fail to respond to specific pharmacologic treatments may sometimes respond to this multireceptor blockade (e.g., pregnancy sickness, PONV). Because the mechanisms mediating most types of nausea and vomiting are not clear but there may be many different contributory stimuli, the use of a mixed pharmacologic approach is logical. This may account for the extensive use of trimeprazine in palliative care.

So far (from what I've think I've learned) a good alternative for metoclopramide would be promethazine, it fits the description to be a suitable anti-emetic to be used alongside SN and it is a lot easier to get ahold of too.

A friend and I recently found out we had ondansetron laying around in our medicine cabinets and I assumed that since it was listed alongside metoclopramide as another antiemetic used for surgery, that's not the case actually... ondansetron is NOT suitable to be used with SN because it doesnt block the dopamine receptors.

Is promethazine a dopamine antagonist? Yes.

""Promethazine is used to treat N&V and motion sickness. Promethazine is also used as a sedative-hypnotic because of its ability to block dopamine receptors. Allergic reactions caused by histamine release may be treated by promethazine through blocade of histamine receptors (H1 subtype).""
source: journals.lww.com

""Promethazine is a phenothiazine derivative first-generation H1 receptor antagonist but is also an antagonist at muscarinic (M1) and dopamine (D2) receptors.""
source: www.sciencedirect.com

Is ondansetron a dopamine antagonist? No.

""Ondansetron is a highly specific and selective serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, with low affinity for dopamine receptors.""
source: en.m.wikipedia.org

""Zofran (ondansetron) and Reglan (metoclopramide) belong to different antiemetic drug classes. Zofran is a selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and Reglan is a dopamine antagonist.""

Pantoprazole is not suggested, it's a PPI. taking a double dose of a PPI also wouldn't do much of anything vs the normal dose, if there was a scenario where it would help, SN is not one of those scenarios. Other antacids (H2 antihistamines, like ranitidine and famotidine) work basically as soon as the drug is dissolved, but they haven't been shown to provide any benefit to this scenario . PPIs take about 24 hours from dosing to do anything. The best I've been able to come up with is we want to have an anti-emetic that's acts on dopamine, preferably metoclopramide or domperidone, sometimes ondansetron, are common ones (not totally necessary, it's a luxury, but I think it ultimately helps by getting the SN into the intestines faster).

I would switch out the ibuprofen for acetaminophen (paracetamol). I've had way better experience myself and with patients with acetaminophen treating pain than anti-inflammatory meds, because we're not really dealing with an inflammatory situation. Acetaminophen is an analgesic and not a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen.

Not fasting or having heavy meal before fasting for SN drink will make the vomit cause more suffer because its solid food.
Its about the balance, not fasting for so long or not enough fasting time to empty stomach. As when you have empty stomach, the SN will directly be absorbed.

A letter from a poet before CTB who deeply loved only one woman,2678277,zaxxy1810,"Sep 22, 2024 at 10:28 AM","Dear friend,

I don't know why, but I want to explain to you the essence of my defeat from which I will never recover. First of all, you must know that my unhappiness is not just love misery. Or, more precisely, it is, if this love of mine is understood as eros in the Spinozist sense. That Woman was not only my lover. She was the first and basic need of my spirit. She was also my spiritual protection and shelter. She was for me a protective cover from the metaphysical November. Without Her, I am completely and directly exposed to cosmic nonsense and night. My loneliness is now absolute. For me, there is no realm of pure singing and singing. Now my songs are looking for my head. There is no one left to reconcile me with them. Only She knew that. And she didn't know that she knew. Next to her, the most dangerous thoughts turned into wonderful and harmless metaphors. Now it's all gone wild and it's tearing at me. If only I could get away from what I said! I live in terrible fear. I'm afraid to speak, to write. Every word can kill me. I wrote most of my songs before I fell in love with her, but only with her did I become a poet, that is, one who is not threatened by what he sings about, who has a privileged position in relation to what he says. Now my poetry loses all value and turns into my fiercest enemy. Maybe I would have become a real poet if that wonderful woman had stayed by my side. This is how I am the one who played with fire and got burned. Defeat cannot be victory, no matter how big it is. Losing her, I lost my strength and my gift. I can't write anymore. All that is left is a calamity, from which nothing else can be made, except a new calamity. Do you remember, dear friend, that I wrote the verse ""An unhappy man cannot be a poet"". Only now do I see how true that is. I will try to live on, although I am more dead than all the dead put together. But this terrible suffering is the last remnant of what is human in me. If I outlive her, don't expect anything good from me. But I don't believe that I will outlive her.

He wishes you the best

P.S.
If you want to write to me, write to me about Her. Anything. Not about me. What does he eat, how does he sleep, does he have a cold, etc.; you can know all that. Every little thing related to Her is priceless to me. If I stop thinking about her, I'll start thinking about death.

Opioid Megathread & Overview,2216485,Rhizomorph1,"Oct 30, 2023 at 1:14 AM","Preamble

I wanted to write something similar to Stan's guide to SN but I hesitate to call this a guide because I can't in good conscience make a guide for something so unreliable in terms of access, lethality, and risk of permanent injury. I.e., traumatic brain injury from hypoxia. SN is a far more reliable and lower-risk alternative in this regard.

Indeed, the PPH strongly recommends against opioids for these reasons.

However, many will still seek to ctb using opioids due to reasons of accessibility, their notoriety for taking lives in the current overdose epidemic, and/or their well-known status as euphoriants and painkillers. The PPH does not go into details about how to ctb with opioids and overlooks different routes of administration and available drug checking services that can inform people on what is in their drugs.

The major benefit of opioids is that if successfully performed, death will be guaranteed to be peaceful, and perhaps even enjoyable for some. At face-value opioids would seem like an attractive method for this reason alone. But, I encourage spending some time forming an unbiased/neutral assessment of both the risks and benefits of this method, before making a decision.

The goal of this thread is twofold:
Help some to reconsider this method due to its poor reliability and risks of permanent injury/disability.
Provide information to improve reliability and minimize risk for permanent injury/disability for those who choose this method anyways.
**Even following the methods in this thread, opioid poisoning remains very unreliable due to variability in personal tolerance and uncontrollable factors related to drug quality.

Introduction

This thread is dedicated to compiling and discussing information on the method of opioid poisoning. Please feel free to comment with any additional information or recommended edits/criticisms to this post.

What are Opioids?

Opioids are analgesic (pain-relieving) drugs that, in high enough doses, result in death via respiratory depression. Examples include morphine, heroin, fentanyl, oxycodone (AKA Percocet or Oxycontin), hydrocodone, hydromorphone (AKA Dilaudid), codeine (AKA T3s), tramadol, and many others.

Pros and Cons

Pros
Nearly guaranteed to be peaceful, if successful
Accessible for people with pre-existing sources/dealers
Non-violent
Can easily be portrayed as ""accidental"", especially if one already uses drugs
Cons
Low to moderate reliability
Risk of permanent damage; traumatic injury, organ failure, etc.
Non-accessible for people without pre-existing sources/dealers or access to dark net
Reduced reliability for people with tolerance to opioids (e.g., from pre-existing opioid use)
Unpredictable: significant variance in effects from person to person (genetic/etc.-related tolerance & sensitivity)

How Do Opioids Work to Induce Death? What Does it Feel Like?

Opioid drugs bind to the opioid receptors in the brain which are the brain's primary pain-killing receptors. At high enough doses, this causes the nervous system to become depressed to a point where the brain stops sending signals to the lungs to breathe. This results in hypoxic death from lack of oxygenated blood to the brain and body. By the time of fatal respiratory depression, the person's brain will have been flooded with pain-killing signals and will also be completely unconscious (likened to a state of general anaesthesia); they will not experience any suffering.

Prior to losing consciousness, opioids can cause feelings of contentment, relaxation, euphoria, a warm and pleasurable feeling in the body, and has generally been described as being cozied up in a blanket beside a fire. Many people experience a cold flush and/or nausea and vomiting, especially their first time using opioids. Vomiting is not an issue for the effectiveness of ctb if the opioids were not consumed orally, but may be uncomfortable for some. Notably, the pleasurable opioid effects often make people indifferent to nausea. In some cases, intravenous injection may result in such rapid onset of effects that blackout occurs almost immediately, bypassing the pleasurable effects.

Which Opioids are Considered Best For CTB?

In short, heroin or fentanyl are ideal.

Stronger opioids such as heroin, fentanyl, or oxycodone are generally preferable as other types of opioids require much larger doses and thus have higher risk of failure. For example, heroin is about 10x as strong as morphine.

Pharmaceutical-grade opioids might be considered preferable by some given that their dosages are accurately labelled and they are not potentially contaminated or sold as different drugs entirely like with illegal markets. However, many pharmaceutical opioids also contain high concentrations of anti-inflammatory drugs such as paracetamol, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen (e.g., Percocet) that are likely to cause significant stomach pain and damage organs in the doses required to ctb. They also often contain fillers (e.g., Oxycontin) that make them unsuitable for injection or other routes of administration. Eating these medications is also not recommended as it is very likely to fail due to vomiting and oral bioavailability is low.

I highly recommend against using weak opioids like codeine, tramadol, or hydromorphone (dilaudid) as they are far too weak to reliably ctb.

I also recommend against research chemical opioids as too little is known about them to reliably ctb and the risk for pain, adverse effects, etc. is high.

Where Can I Get Opioids?

As mentioned above, some people get them by prescription, but most people will opt for heroin or fentanyl which are rarely prescribed. Illicit opioids can be found by contacting a dealer on the street or sourcing them via the dark net. See: How to Access Dark Net Markets for Ctb Resources or download tor browser and look up the Dark Net Market Buyer's Bible which you can find a .onion link for on the https://tor.taxi/ directory (.onion links in this directory can only be accessed using the tor browser).

Street drugs may be more accessible for some, but tend to be much more contaminated with other drugs and have significant variability in concentrations. Fentanyl, for example, tends to vary from around 5-25% concentration in a given sample. It is often cut with caffeine, benzodiazepines, cocaine, heroin, paint thinners, even concrete, and a range of other drugs. This webpage shows data on common cuts and buffs in the opioid supply, demonstrating how unreliable quality sourcing is off the street.

Dark net markets tend to have higher quality drugs due to their review system which adds some (but far from perfect) level of accountability. The gold star method would involve sourcing from a vendor with a long track record of positive reviews combined with utilizing drug-checking services (see below). China white #4 heroin is advisable.

The Importance of Checking Your Drugs

Because the drug supply on the street and dark net markets are heavily contaminated and inconsistently dosed, it is important to get your drugs checked using harm reduction services such as Energy Control (EU; possibly worldwide) or Get Your Drugs Tested (Canada) to determine approximate concentrations, to confirm the presence of your expected opioid, and to rule out the presence of other drugs. Some jurisdictions have local services where you can get your drugs checked legally, anonymously, and confidentially in-person.

*Energy Control has confirmatory chromatography testing meaning they can tell you more precise information without the limitations below. They should be able to tell you the exact concentration. Try to figure out if the service you use utilizes confirmatory/chromatography testing or an FTIR machine.

*Important: The FTIR spectroscopy technology used by Get Your Drugs Tested and many similar organizations has some limitations:
It can only detect concentrations within a margin of error that is around 10%. I.e., Results will usually say, for example ""between 40-50% heroin"". Some organizations prefer not to share concentrations unless explicitly asked.
It can only detect the presence of drugs that are above 5% concentration within the sample. There could be multiple other drugs present in a given sample below the 5% detection limit.
The ""chocolate chip cookie effect"": it can only detect what is in the portion of the sample you send them; just like in a cookie if you break off a chunk, there may or may not be chocolate chips in the chunk. Some drugs tend to clump together and won't be present in the ""chunk"" you send for testing. Grinding your sample to ensure it is a homogeneous mixture before mailing a portion may reduce this risk.
Fentanyl test strips can also be accessed online and via many pharmacies. However, they will only detect the presence of fentanyl and provide no information on concentrations. Plenty of fentanyl samples are massively under-dosed so fentanyl test strips alone are insufficient.

The Method

Now that you have sourced your opioid of choice, determined its relative concentration and ruled out the presence of other drugs, you need to ensure the right amount enters your body the right way.

Dose

A lethal dose of heroin for a person without any tolerance is technically 30mg. For fentanyl, it is considered 3mg. However, it is unlikely your sample will be 100% pure or even close to it. These doses are also on the lower end of the spectrum and will only be lethal in a proportion of people. A more conservative/reliable aim is at least 150mg for heroin and 15mg for fentanyl.

You will need to do some math based on the relative concentrations provided by the drug checking services you accessed previously. If you have a gram (1,000mg) of powder with a concentration/purity of 10-20% fentanyl, this means there is between 100-200mg of fentanyl in the gram of powder.

Here's an example of the math for a 500mg sample that has a concentration of 30-40% heroin:

500mg x 0.3 (30%) = 150
500mg x 0.4 (40%) = 200

Therefore, 500mg of 30-40% heroin will contain between 150-200mg of heroin. It is recommended to dose conservatively to ensure that the lower end of the range includes the lethal dose.

If you have any tolerance to opioids, this will also reduce the method's reliability further as you will have to do some guesswork to increase your dose accordingly. Erring on the side of caution by taking a larger dose will improve reliability.

Regarding Polydrug Poisoning & Potentiation

Some may wish to combine their opioid with other depressants which can potentiate the effects of opioids, making them more lethal. This is not necessary if you have a large enough dose of opioids but doesn't hurt to improve reliability or if the dose of opioids itself is too small to ctb on its own. The drugs below potentiate the effects of opioids meaning each individual drug has its own effect, but there is an additional effect due to the interaction between these drugs (almost like a 3rd effect on top of the individual effects of the 2 drugs). Potentiation will make the opioid more lethal by causing respitatory failure with a lower dose.

*Important: Although potentiating small doses of opioids with depressants will increase its reliability, it is still very unreliable compared to just using a high dose of opioids. Ideally one would use a sufficiently large dose of opioids in the first place and the addition of sedatives will only be included as a fail-safe.

Potentiating drugs that can be included are below:

- Benzodiazepines (e.g., Xanax (alprazolam), Klonopin (clonazepam), etizolam, Ativan (lorazepam), Valium (diazepam), etc. Benzodiazepines are drugs that reduce anxiety and cause sedation and relaxation. The combination has become increasingly associated with overdose deaths as dealers are cutting the fentanyl supply with benzodiazepines to make them feel stronger. The current supply of fentanyl in Canada witnesses around half of samples containing benzodiazepines. Check your drugs with the services above so you know whether yours contains benzodiazepines.

- Alcohol

- Z-drugs such as zolpidem (ambien) or zopiclone. Z-drugs are commonly prescribed for insomnia/as sleeping pills.

Route of administration (ROA)

The two ideal ROAs are intravenous injection and rectal administration. Other options are less ideal for the reasons described below.

Injections are preferable for anyone who has experience using needles or those willing to learn. Just make sure you draw visible blood into the syringe before pushing the plunger down, and don't hit an artery. Use sterile needles. 30-31 gauge syringes are provided no-questions-asked at most pharmacies or can be obtained online. More detailed instructions on preparing your shot can be found with a quick google search. I recommend following all harm reduction protocols (except ""start low, go slow - for obvious reasons) such as sanitary procedure, in case of ctb failure or abort. I know the risk may seem trivial, but you don't want to fail ctb only to be hospitalized and in pain due to a serious blood infection.

Rectal administration is the second most effective method as it has high bioavailability and is suitable for those who wish to skip the stress (or potential phobia) of needles. All you need is a small oral syringe, some water, and some lube for your bum hole. It is marginally less reliable as absorption will be slightly slower. This guide is great for detailing how to do it.

*Note: regarding the homophobia/stigma of men penetrating their butts with a syringe, it does make you gay. That's the best part! Jokes aside, straight men all over the world insert things in their butts to consume drugs (recreational, suppositories, to die), and sexual pleasure. There would be a lot less of us on this forum if not for homophobia… Show your support for us queer folk by dying with heroin up your arse <3

Oral administration is not suitable as it has a low bioavailability and vomiting is incredibly likely. Anti-emetics can be used, but this ROA is still inadvisable due to slow absorption/poor bioavailability. Snorting is also not recommended as absorption can be slow and is effected by the amount of powder in your nostrils; the more powder, the slower the absorption. It is also less bioavailable than injection or rectal administration.

Regarding Naloxone/Suicide Reversal

I feel compelled to advise people on how naloxone works in case anyone should want it by their side. Although most of us aim to ctb without potential for hesitation or reversal, cases where people will consume their lethal dose by whatever means and regret it or contact help are not out of the question.

Should you wish to have a means of reversal (up until the point where you cannot move your body or notify others for help; this will occur very quickly in most cases), naloxone is an effective reversal agent. Naloxone kits usually come with 3 vials and 3 syringes. You may wish to prepare the naloxone by drawing it into the syringes in advance in case you change your mind last minute. There is nothing wrong with changing your mind.

*Injection use of opioids will provide less/potentially no opportunity for reversal as the onset is so quick one may blackout immediately. Rectal administration will take place in approximately 5 minutes after adminstration.

You should dose yourself with at least 2 or more doses as you will have taken a dose that is likely considerably larger than what most people overdose on. If comfortable, contact emergency services after dosing the naloxone as it has a short half-life and when it wears off the opioid effects can cause you to collapse and die later on. If you aren't comfortable contacting emergency services, consider getting 2 or more naloxone kits so you can dose yourself repeatedly until certain the opioid effects have worn off.

Naloxone works by kicking the opioid off your brain's opioid receptor. You can access naloxone kits legally and confidentially at most local pharmacies. It is relatively intuitive to use and will not harm you in any way; it has virtually no interactions with other drugs. You will feel sober afterwards and that is about it.

A research chemical could have very low efficacy (e.g., codeine) due to a combination of factors (low lipid solubility/absorption, high rate of metabolism, low binding affinity at opioid subreceptors), or it could have very high efficacy like fentanyl or heroin. Individual variance in tolerance or response to the drug is also unknown.

Other factors like binding affinity for non-opioid receptors, toxicity to non-vital organs, or effects on other biological systems will be unknown, meaning death could be slow, painful, or involve various complications.

I wouldn't recommend research chemicals given the substantial number of unknown factors. Accessibility is the *only* benefit for those who have a clear-net source.
The difference depends on what is contained in the street fentanyl. I can't really say because street fentanyl varies so dramatically, with some samples even containing no fentanyl whatsoever or containing completely different psychoactive drugs (probably less than 5% or so of the so-called ""fentanyl"" supply, but it still shows how inconsistent it is). Street fentanyl is not regulated and thus could be any combination of drugs with any effects.

This is why getting your drugs checked and doing the math based on the concentration provided by drug-checking services is important; to ensure you consume the same approximate quantity of fentanyl.

Two drugs commonly included in street fentanyl are caffeine and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) because they can help with dissolving and injecting the drug. They shouldn't have a profound impact. Things like erythritol, mannitol, or inositol are inert sugars that are safe and won't have any effect. However, the more of these ""buffs"" present, the less opioid will be present concentration-wise, which also signals the need to check your drugs.

1 mg of street fentanyl = 1mg of medical fentanyl. It's all the other stuff in street fentanyl that varies substantially that will make the difference in terms of ctb efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, etc.",2226793,2228072,,,,,,,,

Opioid Megathread & Overview,2231760,Rhizomorph1,"Nov 9, 2023 at 6:49 PM","The issue with intranasal is that the more powder you insufflate, the slower the absorption will be because of a few factors:
1. powder ""clogging"" up the nose
2. powder drying up the mucous membranes (moisture facilitates absorption)
3. irritation to the sinuses causing inflammation which can ""push"" the powder away from the mucous membranes

The other issue that corresponds to point #3 is that depending on how one snorts the power (snorting ""hard"" vs. ""soft"", with a straw/without, etc.) will affect where the drug is deposited in the nose. The mucous membranes are a specific distance from the nostrils and depositing it too far up will lead it to drip down the throat, which is not only unpleasant but will further reduce the bioavailability and absorption speed as it will now be consumed orally. Likewise, depositing too close to the nostril openings will have essentially no effect as it won't get absorbed.

In small doses it can be reliable for achieving psychoative effects (the ""high""), but in larger doses - especially those needed to ctb - the reduced bioavailabiltiy compared to injection or rectal use combined with the variable/exponentially reduced absorption (based on the factors above) make snorting less than ideal.

It's not impossible, but I don't recommend snorting as it will further reduce the reliability within an already unreliable method.",2230223,,,,,,,,,

I think the time before death is likely to vary by the amount of opioids consumed and individual factors. Some people may be more sensitive or resistant to the respiratory depressive effects vs. others at the same dose. Speaking theoretically, a small dose or slow absorption could depress breathing to a point of slow interspersed breaths where there is insufficient oxygen to avoid damage but sufficient to sustain life. The ""size"" of the dosage window for this to occur may vary by person. If this were to happen my guess is a person could die very slowly, or simply recover with brain damage. This is why it is important to dose conservatively and taking a dose well above the minimum lethal amount or lethal median dose (LD50; the dose at which 50% of people will die)

I'm not a doctor though and don't know the precise relationship between opioid effects on breathing. I'm entirely making an educated guess.

A larger dose that is absorbed more quickly is more likely to completely depress breathing in which case most people can only survive a few minutes without oxygen. There are plenty of people who get revived by naloxone well after the time it would usually take to suffocate under other conditions indicating it probably varies.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732170/ this literature review doesn't provide more concrete data but does say that death occurred quickly for most overdoses.

My best guess is it will vary by the person's tolerance to opioids, individual response to the opioid's respiratory depressing effects, the dose of opioids taken, purity of opioids, the half life of the opioid drug in question, and many other factors. It could take minutes or it could take hours.

Checking your drugs, dosing accordingly, and being mindful about personal tolerances to opioids may help improve reliability but unfortunately there are a lot of unpredictable possibilities with this method.

A high enough dosage taken via injection or rectally while in a location where one will not be found or resuscitated will almost certainly result in death.

The question is whether the dose is high enough for the person and whether they know the purity of their drug(s).

Thankfully because IV and rectal ROAs don't carry the risk of failure from vomiting associated with larger doses, one can always take a larger dose to improve (but probably not ensure) the reliability of this method.",2238944,,,,,,,,,

BTW, I know it doesn't make much of a difference, but isn't it likely that a toxicology report will show huge amounts of opioids in the persons system and death will be ruled as intentional overdose instead of accidental? Nobody shoots up a gram of heroin without any tolerance.",2239012,,,,,,,,,
Opioid Megathread & Overview,2258785,Rhizomorph1,"Nov 29, 2023 at 12:20 PM","I don't know enough about benzimidazole to say for sure. If there were enough research on it it could perhaps be used. I would personally avoid it but if you can find reliable research you could try it.

Opioids will show up in a toxicology report. It could look unintentional for a few reasons:

- a person could be drug-naive and be unfamiliar with dosage or suspect that the drug is a different drug altogether. One could try to leave behind other subtle ""evidence"" that they were experimenting with recreational drugs (e.g., some cannabis or baggies of cocaine; whatever fits the bill for the circumstances they want to construct). It's not perfect but it may leave people uncertain at least.

- drugs like fentanyl often contain around 5-25% fentanyl but occasionally samples come around that are 90%+ pure fentanyl. As long as there is none of the physical sample left behind then the toxicology reports won't show the concentration of the fentanyl in the sample, but only how much actually got into one's system. For someone who already uses opioids it would be reasonable to believe they just had a really strong batch (even if they actually just took a significantly larger dose of a weaker batch)

It would probably require some careful planning to make it appear accidental and would leave authorities/family members potentially questioning whether it was intentional or not. Making it appear accidental is probably more effective for people who are already known to use opioids.
Stan's Guide to SN covers the SN method and discusses how peaceful/painful it might be. It seems fairly peaceful, with headaches, nausea, tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), and some mild sweating or anxiety being the bulk of uncomfortable effects that usually only last around 10-20 minutes before losing consciousness. If curious go ask some questions there :)

For fentanyl or heroin the best bet is to access the dark net (see my OP for resources to access the dark net). As I mentioned, use a drug checking service to verify how much fentanyl/heroin are actually in a sample you purchase.

I would recommend SN over opioids for its reliability alone.
Can you share what your experience was?

It is usually peaceful for most people but anecdotal stories will help to inform people what they could expect or what to avoid doing",2258600,2254340,2258506,,,,,,,

I think Rhizomorph1 meant that you may blackout approximately 5 minutes after rectal administration.

What about combining an opioid (specifically codeine, administered rectally) with alcohol (drunken normally)? I expect that the timing matters because it takes time for the alcohol to enter your blood system. I would welcome feedback on this idea.",2216485,,,,,,,,,
Opioid Megathread & Overview,2288509,Rhizomorph1,"Dec 23, 2023 at 6:34 PM","You would need a ridiculously high dose of codeine to successfully ctb even taken rectally.

The combined codeine and alcohol in your bloodstream will result in the majority of alcohol being vomited and thus not crossing the blood brain barrier. The nauseating effects of the opioid may even result in vomiting before any noteworthy amount of alcohol is absorbed.

It probably won't hurt if the codeine is what you're trying to use to ctb, but if you're already consuming drugs rectally, why not take the alcohol rectally too so you don't lose any upon vomiting?

I would not recommend using codeine or alcohol as even strong opioids (e.g., heroin/fent) are pretty unreliable and alcohol is very unreliable too. Codeine is even weaker than heroin/fent.

There are many issues with the suggested method's reliability. I'd bet money on you waking up in hospital with a nasty hangover covered in vomit.",2288415,,,,,,,,,

This is the most genuine post I've ever seen and there is no way this was made to get a reaction out of us. Complaining about Asians having good skin and how that makes you, a non-Asian person (probably), ugly is definitely a normal complaint.

Joking aside, I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that you're being honest. With that in mind, having good skin has nothing to do with your race. I happen to live in a very diverse area, so I've interacted with a lot of Asian people growing up and how nice their skin was varied a lot from person to person. I've met Asians who issues with acne, had scarring all over their face, skin conditions, and issues with their skin complexion. I've also met many non-Asians with perfect skin. Good skin comes down to a mixture of lifestyle choices and genetics. Some people just luck out more than others when it comes to their skin. People's skin can also vary a lot in appearance over time. For example, my face is usually clear up until I'm about to get my period and my eczema flares up a few times every year.

It's very weird to specifically obsess over the skin (and general appearance) of Asians. It comes off as though you fetishize and put them on this sort of pedestal and it's kind of off-putting, ngl.",,,,,,,,,,

SN or Inert Gas? I have both,2665939,Msvr,"Sep 10, 2024 at 11:07 PM","I will soon have access to both SN and N2. I already have all the part for my N2 setup (including 40 cu ft tank of gas,) except one part which arrives tomorrow. I also managed to find the DMC source by clues on various threads throughout the forum. I just ordered that a couple days ago and will have access to the other required medications such as meto and cimetidine.

Now initially I was only interested in the SN method. However I read a couple other threads on this forum comparing the two and most seemed to prefer the inert gas. After researching further I became more comfortable with the inert gas method and would be willing to try it. Still the SN sounds better to me. It will be nice to drink a glass of water and nearly peacefully fall asleep. The downsides are more time for SI to kick in, and the somewhat questionable feelings and pains during the final minutes. @CocoToxBase has a couple good write up about her SN near-deaths. Sorry those didn't go as you wanted.
On the other hand there are several things I'm not a fan of with the inert gas method. I would be happy with a sarco pod, but the exit bag is slightly scary.
- If I mess up it can cause serious brain damage.
- I'd much rather my body be found peacefully laying in bed instead of strapped up to a beach chair like Frankenstein
- The inert gas method is very loud, right next to you
- I'd have to strap myself to a chair to be safe. What if I strap myself, fail, and cant get up. What if SI kicks in and i can't escape in the few seconds before unconsciousness

So those are my personal downsides for each. What do you guys think?",,,,,,,,,,

Be sure to:
1) strap the canister to a bed or chair leg, so if u lose consciosuness, it still stays.
2) set reductor valve to 15-20 L/min.
3) put a very small hole, maybe pencil size or smaller 2-5mm on the top of the bag, so that used air/CO2 will come out, and new inert gas will have space to go inside the bag.
4) secure the bag firmly on your neck, in 30s-1min the bag will get full and you dont want it to be disattached from your neck. But dont secure as hard that you have a hard time breathing(!)
5) before putting the bag onto your head, wait some time so it becomes at least 50% full with inert gas. During this time, hyperventilate (take about 10 deep and quick breaths), then place the bag in final position, and secure it.
6) Take 4-8 deep breaths, and you drift into unconsciousness and you dont have CO2 panic reflex (omg Im getting suffocated). There is no reflex, your lungs and brain dont differentiate between air and inert gas.

I think, tests with a mannequin ain't really informative, since mannequins can't breathe, so they don't let adequately simulate gas flows you'd have in the bag under actual conditions.",2676963,2676989,,,,,,,,

Exit bags account for the initial large intake of breath. The PPH recommends 25 LPM for EEBD hood, but only 15 LPM for exit bag as you already start with a large bag of inert gas.

KEEP IN MIND that they are kept under like 200bar pressure, so your 8L canister contains 8 x 200 = 1600 L of gas.

From my research, to be sure your dead you need 15-20 L/min for 15minutes (45- 60minutes etc, are WAY OFF) 15L x 15min = 225L.
600+ liters is 2,5x as much, but if someone wants to be 100% sure, I'd go for 600 liters. But remember, even 3L canister has 3x200 [in case of 200bar] = 600L.

I was an outsider, outside the norms. I thought they were very wise and I was a rookie who needed to learn more. I realized too late that they were empty inside, that they were just copies of each other. There was nothing to learn from them. Even in the worst conditions, their brains tell them ""you are happy"". I thought there was wisdom under this happiness and strong appearance.

Ketamine dose for plastic bag over head suicide - thoughts please,2677505,Romanticize,"Sep 21, 2024 at 5:32 PM","I used ketamine a few dozen times, dosages of 50 mg to 250 mg, and only 250 mg [it was snorted, 2 lines of about 125 mg to each nose ""hole""] cut me off from reality.
I think that was the k-hole; I was curled up in embryo-position and just living through the trip, very internalized. I wasn't aware of my surroundings nor what waa happening around me.

I remember it wa a good class ket ro UK, fine crystal needles, which of course needed to be crushed to powder before snorting.

So my advice would be: don't go below 300mg if you want to be disconnected from reality, and given your description that's what you want.
If you want to administer it IV/IIM (intravenous/intramuscular), I am sure a lower dose like 200 g would be enough. I lack experience, though, with this administration route.

I understand why she did it. She obviously doesn't want you to go. I don't exactly think she's horrible but it does put an enormous amount of pressure on someone to ask them to promise that. Realistically, no one can promise it either. Even your friend. None of us know what's ahead of us. We could come down with a very painful incurable illness. Anything could happen.

I think you're handling it better than I would. That sort of thing would definitely make me feel guilty and awful but to be honest, a part of me would feel annoyed at them for trying to make me feel like that. It's different to say- I hope things change for you. I hope you end up wanting to stay. Even to ask someone to say goodbye before the end but, a promise to stay? That's presumably under any circumstances. No matter how bad things are for you, you need to promise to stay for me. I just don't think that's fair. (Sorry.)

I'm sure your friend is amazing and I remember you saying they have an awful lot to deal with themselves. I suppose they're just being honest about how they feel too. It's just a lot to ask of someone I think. If your situations were swapped, would you ask them to promise that to you?

I think it's something therapists sometimes use. I had to talk to a helpline following the IC SN welfare checks and they asked me to promise I would call them before I used it. I just said I knew their number and I would reach out to them if I wanted their help. Really though, I was thinking- of course I won't ring you! If I'm certain I want to CTB, why on earth would I ring somewhere who do all in their power to prevent it? Including sending police! How stupid do you think I am? But obviously- I didn't say that.

Venting,2660570,happynuclearwinter,"Sep 6, 2024 at 5:32 PM","What I'm about to write is cringe but whatever. I think people know me as the edgiest mf ever alive, my friend knows that, it's an open secret. To the point people around me can't take me seriously anymore everytime I'm having a breakdown, I don't blame them tbh. I know that being bothered with constant demands of someone else's life threatening conditions suck ass.

So I stopped reaching for help. Atleast with people around me. I kept keeping everyone at arms length because that's what the best for me and you. I don't like being needy. I don't like being so called ""burden"". I don't like showing people how depressed I am, it's humiliating. Heck I wish I'm normal. I want to be normal so bad.

I've went to therapy, not good. Horrible. All I got is +20kg weight gain. I'm bulimic way before therapy happened. Healthcare isn't the best if you live in a 3rd world country. Not anorexic because I'm fat, that's just how they categorize it I think, how convenient .

Okay so the reason? Variable of things. So many factors. Family problems, money problems, how I'm battling with my self image, all that jazz.

My mother was physically abusive growing up, I remembered that my body would be constantly bruising and purplish, which I would poke, because it has this silly shapes and dots upside and I played with it as if it was a sensory toy LOL. Another time I was crying and she grabbed a scissor and starts to harm my left hand, she did this circling motion with the scissor, idk what I did to deserve that. For those who reading this and thinking, ""I was abused by my parents too and I'm turned out fine!"" You are not.

This type of stuff continues until 2020. Where she completely tames out bcs she found a new dude that she dates until now. Good for her I guess idk I don't blame her because she went through a massive pain in the ass what I would called a father, he does everything that every unavailable father would do! Gambles, womanizer, bad with money, alcoholic etc. He's a black belt jiujitsu instructor so everytime he hit me it hurts for DAYS.

It's just so normal in this dysfunctional family. One of my most painful memory is my younger brother would accompany my dad to play poker with his friends and my dad won the gambling. They both went home and my little brother shouted ""dad wins today! We'll eat fried chicken tonight!"". He was 7.

It's not like we were super poor -lives in a shack - type of poor but I just remembered that we can't really afford anything nice. I only go to kfc when it's my birthday. No physical presents. What a luxury. I never complain about this though because I thought this is the norm for every household out there LOL

At school I sticks out like a sore thumb, physically tan (don't come at me with oww dark skin are so pretty!!! My brother in christ we're in southeast asia) messy, stupid loser who draws all the time. I was constantly bullied. Even as a kid I am aware that I'm not conventionally attractive, my childhood pictures looked like a freakshow. No one has a crush on me. My uniforms are hand me downs from my sister (yes I'm a middle child, this will comes out again later). And my parents refuses to buy me books. So all I got is notepads, I feel bad for those who sits next to me. They'll let you know that they don't like sharing.

I've been drawing all my life and that's the only thing I'm good at. I want to pursue art. My parents doesn't really care though. I bought all of my art supplies by myself. They never chip in a single cents ever. Which I take pride in that. All my life I thought if you can draw good then you're guaranteed a prosperous career! I was so fucking wrong.

You need a degree and exps! And mostly luck. My parents refuses to put me to college, yet they sent my sister n my brother out there. This hurts so fucking bad. My mom lied to her friend that I went to college just so she can save herself from the shame.

At this point I just realize it's a blantant favoritism, Mother always talks about how she wants a son and not a daughter, a loser daughter like me. Heck my siblings were abused too but they're supported by my parents growing up.

Creative industry here is also fucked up. Runned by people who don't know jackshit abt drawing. Every so called studio with inadequate shit inside will sucks out your soul alive and pays you minimum wage, working as a cleaning service is much more worth it at this point. Imagine pumping out 1 finished artwork per day and being paid $7 bucks. Your coworkers are brainwashed with the we are family bullshittery. It's a matter of time that I'd be brainwashed as well. I tried to apply somewhere else but I have no luck. That's what I'm lacking. Luck. Or maybe it's all just skill issues from my side.

I wish every exploitative art studios burns. But that's just not how it works and that's not how it'll turns out in the end. I don't know. Maybe I'm just tired. My coworkers kept saying do the bare minimum, but like, they done so fucking good at their tasks, not to mention they do side commissions, like how the fuck did they do that? I'm barely alive when I arrive at my room. I disassociate all the time.

So I pushed harder and harder until I get CTS. Both of my hands caught it. It felt like my world is crumbling. Now I'm actually suck at drawing. I can't do the only thing I can do. This is like the factor that shoves me to the edge. I'm not recovering anytime soon and it drives me nuts. I don't have insurance to cover me because the last time I asked my dad to help with insurance he used my ID card to sign up a shady loan services for $900 without me knowing.

I escape home for a job 1000km away just stuck in another meat prison, so to speak.

I've been looking at SN and I realized how accessible it's here. But to me it's expensive as heck, it's half of my total salary per month.

I want to die so bad. I'm on my breaking point. It doesn't get better. Everytime it gets slightly better life just throws another problem at you. I hate it here.",,,,,,,,,,

Plus, if you're using an AE like Meto or Domperidone, your stomach acid won't be as big of a concern since the stomach will empty faster anyways.

And even if you could, I'm telling you right now you don't want that. It won't kill you quickly like you seem to think. Many with eating disorders live years to decades before it takes them. And as long as you are alive you will be in hell on earth. Think things are bad right now? They'll be 10X worse once an eating disorder is on board. All of your thoughts will be consumed by food and weight. From the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep you are thinking about food and number and calories and clothing sizes and how you look in the reflection of the window and how easily your fingers fit around your other wrist.

An average day in my life:
-Wake up at 1am shitting my brains out from the laxatives I took last night. Have my legs go numb while sitting on the toilet from poor circulation.
-Wake up at 4am shitting my brains out from the laxatives I took last night. Apply some aquaphor to my ass because I have a rash like a fucking baby from the constant diarrhea.
-Wake up at 7 and weigh myself after shitting some more. Hate the number on the scale, even if it's my new lowest weight.
-Take body check photos and compare them to old ones for hours.
-Think about how I'm not going to eat anything until noon.
-Noon comes and I tell myself I'll only eat a little bit.
-Eat more than a little bit because my body is starving and I've lost self control. I still ensure it's not very many calories.
-Measure my whole body. Hate all of it.
-Take laxatives to compensate for how much I hate myself even though I know it won't actually cause any weight loss, I'm just addicted at this point.
-Make plans for how little I'm going to eat tomorrow. I may or may not follow through.
-Browse DoorDash for four hours planning meals I won't allow myself to eat. Possibly buy one and binge.
-Go to bed knowing I won't get a good nights rest because I took so many laxatives I'll be up all night shitting.

My hair is falling out. My skin is always dry. My lips are always chapped. I have poor circulation. My ass is raw from the laxative abuse. My bowels don't work properly without laxatives anymore. My electrolytes are all fucked, which hasn't killed me but it makes me feel constantly sick. I'm anemic. I'm always fatigued. I either don't eat anything or I binge, I have no in between and I have lost control over which one it will be at any given moment. And I haven't even come close to my goal weight despite having relapsed over a year and a half ago.

You do not want this. You will not die quickly. And you will be living a life consumed by numbers and food. You will hate life a million times more than you think you do now.",,,,,,,,,,

It's not natural to starve yourself so- your body will start demanding food which may trigger a binge which may then trigger a purge and then it's just a hellish cycle of anorexia and bulimia.

If you really want to lose weight, you can do it in a sustainable way following a healthy diet. I lost 5 stone over 2 years once following a low carb diet. Basically what we should be eating- lots of lean protein, vegetables, some complex carbohydrates. Try to cut out sugar and processed foods as much as possible.

But yes, I agree. All the stuff we're taught at school- just work hard and you'll be rewarded. All the fairytales we grow up on don't resemble reality.

Still, I suppose I don't see what else they could do- to be fair. Asides from not bringing children in to this- which is my preference, what's to be done when they're here? I do believe that any amount of success depends more on effort than luck. You have to try- and that's across the board- careers, relationships, friendships, even hobbies. And- in order to try, you need to believe it will be worth it. You need hope.

But like you said, what else can be done? Once people are here, they have to try, even though there's no guarantee it will pay off. I agree that success usually requires effort, and across the board—jobs, relationships, everything—trying is essential. And you need hope to try. If we'd been told from the start that hard work doesn't always lead to success, we might not even bother with anything. Without effort, failure is almost certain.

Loneliness Megathread,1339975,LastLoveLetter,"Sep 23, 2021 at 6:48 PM","A recurring theme I have seen on this forum is persistent and profound loneliness. There are many members who have no companionship or connections in their lives at all, always alone and isolated. Others may have some relationships in their lives, but still feel alienated or neglected.

Some have shared that their seclusion has directly caused their suicidality. Some have stated that loneliness exacerbates it. Being suicidal is in itself often a lonely experience, resulting in ostracism and struggling to find understanding. I truly feel that SS is an important lifeline for us. I have encountered nowhere else we can discuss suicidality, systemic exclusion and social rejection so candidly.

The palpable desolation and soul crushing despair that many of us feel is unfathomable to those with healthy, loving support networks. I often find personally that people do not understand that going out and cultivating these connections is not always possible.

As such, I decided to create a Megathread for this subject. The aim is for those who are lonely in life to have a space where they can vent their frustrations, discuss their positions with others in a similar situation and support each other - perhaps even connecting with one another in the process (and becoming a little less lonely as a result).

You can post as much or as little as you like. I will always try my best to check in regularly, both to share and to respond to others.

I'll start by saying that I have always found it difficult to create and subsequently maintain connections, and have long suspected that I am autistic. I have no family and no friends. I am fortunate to have a boyfriend. Although I truly appreciate him, due to the the extent of my illnesses I feel very alone in the world, especially since my symptoms are routinely dismissed and undermined by peers and professionals alike. I often feel like such a burden that it means we do not have a typical relationship, as it revolves around my limitations when we are together. I am awaiting the day he eventually leaves to pursue a balanced relationship, and I truthfully would not blame him if he chooses to separate. I cannot even fulfill his needs romantically due to my illnesses and Complex PTSD, and the guilt of that crushes me.

I spend most of my life housebound, and a large proportion of it bedbound. SS is the only thing I have resembling a social network.

My hope for this thread is that some of us may find even a little bit of solace and solidarity from each other.

Staff will monitor this thread to ensure it stays on topic and is a safe, supportive space for those who participate.",,,,,,,,,,

Loneliness Megathread,1340044,littlelungs,"Sep 23, 2021 at 9:35 PM","I'm likewise chronically ill, way too many problems to list here, but I've mentioned the lot of them a few times around this forum. Being chronically ill in my case means (among many others) extreme isolation, because any sensory stimulation or physical activity leads to permanent worsening and thus further suffering that I cannot afford. I'm housebound and mostly bedbound, spending most of my days in a dark room with earplugs in. I rarely speak because, again, permanent worsening, so I mainly communicate over text. I've tried to make friends online a couple of times, but because I can't speak and I can't always reply in a timely manner, it never works out. Also, most people just don't understand what it means to be chronically ill and its implications and consequences, and while I'm glad on the one hand that they don't have the experience to understand that, it just means further social isolation.

The social isolation in and of itself isn't what bothers me or makes me feel lonely (I've always been introverted and have preferred to keep my circle small, even before I became severely physically ill, and I'm very wary of other people and their intentions, which I don't think is unreasonable); rather it's the fact that I rarely feel heard by most other people, and had to fight for so long just to get someone to listen when it really mattered. The only person who truly understands IRL is my husband (likewise severely chronically ill) and to a large extent my mom (who always tries to understand), and at this point I just don't have it in me anymore to constantly explain myself and my situation to people who clearly don't even care to begin with, and I often badly struggle to put my thoughts and experiences into words, anyway, which is probably already apparent in this post. My reality is (and almost always has been) just too far-off from what most other people can really fathom, and because of this, the more people I'm around, the lonelier I feel.

This is a great idea for a thread, @-Persephone-. Just as an aside, you're one of the members in particular who I can relate to the most, just based on what I've read here, but I'm nowhere even close to being as articulate as you are.

I've been lonely for so long that I genuinely don't desire to connect with others anymore, and I actively isolate myself from the world. It's probably just a coping mechanism my brain latched onto after dealing with loneliness for my entire life. I suspect a combination of a disadvantaged upbringing and undiagnosed autism is why I always had trouble with people and relationships. I don't feel human and I feel as if I wasn't meant to be in this world.

Trauma is very alienating and, needless to say, it has aggravated my loneliness; normal people can't understand my experiences and I can't understand their experiences. When one of my few loved ones was dying of a terminal illness, the world continued to move on as if nothing was happening—I absolutely loathed the fact that people were still enjoying their lives while my own world was falling apart. I now know that was an irrational and selfish feeling, but I've never really recovered ever since. I also had no one to talk to about my trauma, which of course made me feel even more alone.

Loneliness Megathread,1340098,hʚll,"Sep 24, 2021 at 12:11 AM","most times i just think what even the point is in trying to find words to express things if i'm scared of words. i think words hurt, no matter what they say. that makes me feel like we'll always be lonely because i feel like there is always some kind of misunderstanding between us all. and it's hard to fix it. maybe i'm meaning this in a metaphysical way? i'm not sure. but it's painful. it's complex to try to say it .in my mind i think i can see it but when i have to express it for the outside, it's like as if the words i use are corrupting the idea. that feels hopeless, and makes me feel a barrier.
i also have the constant feeling that being alone is the safest thing one can do to not hurt others and theirself, until death takes them out. it's scary to hurt others, even if you don't mean to , even if they aren't aware of it.
sorry if this doesn't make much sense.

Loneliness Megathread,1340117,GenesAndEnvironment,"Sep 24, 2021 at 1:01 AM","Not having friends have no effect on me, my family has a miniscule positive effect (used to be zero but I'm getting warmed up). The feeling of not having a gf has been causing me an average of perhaps 5 minutes of mild to moderate emotional pain per day for the past 5 years or so. Now, that's the estimated average; if I were to map it out, the pain would be made up of a few days a week with intense but short ""tfw no gf"" and a few episodes a month of intense and prolonged crying/fetal position/weird moments/silent screaming/laughing. And there are of course daily small instances of pain that I don't really count since they are not enough to cause any impairment. E.g: walking past a woman, going to the gym and having women be there, etc.

Guess I'm lucky to not be bothered by the lack of friends/social relationships in general and to have a good family.",,,,,,,,,,

Loneliness Megathread,1340194,OrcWitch,"Sep 24, 2021 at 4:23 AM","I think I was born to be lonely. I was born to a vulnerable narcissistic mother and a robot father. They were both emotionally incapable of giving affection, and the only adult who gave me affection was my grandpa. I grew up as a latchkey kid, cooking myself meals and raising myself. By age 9 I noticed that other children's parents paid more attention to them. My dad worked and shut himself in a room in the basement, my mom locked herself in the master bedroom and you had to walk on eggshells not to make her explode.

In early grade school I was ""that kid"" who smelled like shit, because my parents didn't do anything to have a pleasant smelling child. A few times my mom blew up out of nowhere and screamed at me for smelling bad, in retrospect I believe this is because another adult called her out on it and I was a source of making her look bad. It made me alienated and the weird kid. It wasn't until 4th grade I developed the maturity to ensure I smelled fine.

In middle school my few friends abandoned me. That sounds melodramatic but I had 3 best friends. They all became too cool to be seen with me, and became the three musketeers without me. Once they invited me to the dance and encouraged me to come with, then when I went with them they told me to go away and that they didn't want me around them. In retrospect they kept me around as the punching bag, and I basically hungout with them to be bullied by them. I basically shut down and didn't talk to anyone, and I got into mmorpgs and online forums.

My parents got divorced because my mom was an unstable psycho, and I started living with my dad and grandpa. My second day living with them they sat me down and yelled at me for being overweight, then my dad put rotting molding salad mix on a plate and made me eat it, telling me I needed to start eating healthier. Despite this my grandpa basically forced fast food on me everyday. He started molesting me in the morning when he got me up for school. I played world of warcraft and used 4chan and thought about committing suicide all the time. I stopped brushing my teeth or taking care of myself at all really. I dropped out of highschool and got my GED. I lost all my weight and became skinny when I started working and feeding myself, and emotionally coping with marijuana and alcohol and tobacco instead of food. I have not been overweight since.

On my 19th birthday my mom sent me an email apologizing for moving away, and saying she loved me and had been a horrible mother to me. She convinced me to move to her 6 months later. That went well for a few months until she started getting mad at me for working a fastfood job and sleeping on her couch. She stole my money a few times, then acted like the victim when I got upset. She screamed at me for crying on my 20th birthday because she perceived it as an attack on her. She kicked me out that December, and I had to sleep on the floor of my manager's apartment. I got an air mattress soon and built a comfy life at his house, and his wife felt sorry for me. But they were opiate addicts and always extorting money from me, so it was very hard to save to get an apartment. I was young and immature, and did a botched attempt at killing myself while living with them by trying to overdose laying in the snow in the woods. Instead I just vomited like crazy, went home and laid in the bathtub for 3 hours.

Eventually I moved in with an older woman who was looking for a roommate, she was in her early 30s and I was about to turn 21. I couldn't find a friend or boyfriend. My sister said she would go to my 21st birthday, but instead she went out to some costume party thing. My mom sent me pictures of my sister out having fun that night. I invited 5 people from work and they all stood me up, and I drank alone at a bar then went home. It was after that point I gave up on being outgoing, and I found it more comfortable to just sit on the computer than to risk rejection.

I eventually found me savior relationship but it turned physically abusive eventually. One evening my abuser gave me a concussion by hitting me in the back of the head while I had my back turned, and I already had a bruised cheek and eye from the previous few days. I am in therapy for some of the violence I put up with during it and was diagnosed with PTSD.I also have gone no contact with my mom and sister, as they have both treated me poorly. I have not had another real life relationship since then.

I got a job where a girl at work started to be my friend. I even took a bus to a mall with her and we went shopping and got lunch together. At work one day I was within ear shot(people speak very loudly), she was talking about going out drinking with 2 other girls from work that weekend. This girl who was trying to be my friend threw in a suggestion they invite me, and the other girl gave this sarcastic ""uh... yeah we'll see about that...."" response. I tried to act worldly and like I was too high iq to feel anything about it, but I cried pretty hard in my bed once I got home. I moved away and did not bother keeping contact with her.

I made a real life friend in 2020 and I spent a lot of time with her, and she was nice to me. She found a relationship and moved away, and I am back to being alone. I have discord friends and they are what keeps me sane. Sometimes I think I am more grown up and less affected by my isolation, I do not cry very often and feel mellow most of the time. but I am in a discord server of mostly females. I saw them talking about going out partying and having boyfriends and it made me cry the other night, I rarely cry but felt this huge wave of jealousy.

I am turning 29 in a few months and I have never lived. I have a tremendous lump in my throat writing any of this. I feel like I was born to have this failure of a life. Legitimately the only reason I do not kill myself is holding out for the day I have friends and a job and a marriage, and I am not alone. I go to college and I comfort myself in bed at night by playing these little movie clips in my head of the things I would do as a person in a relationship. I want to die because I am losing confidence of this ever coming true. I don't know why I had to be born.",,,,,,,,,,
Loneliness Megathread,1340215,sadworld,"Sep 24, 2021 at 5:26 AM","Thank you so much for this thread. You're struggling yourself but you still care about the loneliness of other people. That's so unbelievably kind of you.
Loneliness is also one of my main struggles.

I've been hurt many times by other people in the past so I am afraid to make friendships or socialise, even online. Besides that my avpd keeps me from any social interactions irl and it also sometimes affects me online as well.

In groups for example I am always the one who gets left out, in real life but also online. I feel like I never fit in anywhere.

All my life long I have been trying to overcome my social anxiety but everytime I did I was always left and forgotten. It hurts like hell when you are always the one person everyone cares the least about.

I've never had any relationship and the last time I had friends was back in 5th grade. Before that, my life was pretty normal but after that was when all the bullying and getting abandoned by ""friends"" started.

I still kept trying and trying to fit in but it made everything worse and worse.

I don't want to get hurt anymore.
A part of me still hopes that maybe one day I will find someone who understands me. Because this loneliness hurts.

But the most part of me has already lost all hope.

I hope to find love and everything I could not find on this world in death.

Loneliness Megathread,1340220,RainAndSadness,"Sep 24, 2021 at 5:57 AM","That's a good thread. I've been lonely my entire life but ever since I did my transition, I haven't really had any romantic or sexual experiences anymore and it's a very important reason as to why I regret transition to a certain extend. Sure, I feel a lot more comfortable in my body now but at what cost? I've completely killed my social life and any perspective to ever have a fulfilling relationship ever again. According to studies, only close to 2% of the general (heteronormative) population is willing to date us. What does that mean? The chances of people actually being into you (despite being trans) are very slim. And most people that are ready to have sexual intercourse with trans people only do so because they get a huge kick out of that. As sad as it is, we are just a kink for many people and nothing more, thanks to the porn industry that lumps transgender people and ""shemales"" together and portrays us as sexual deviants that only wait to have our dicks sucked. You know it's true when the first question of most people expressing interest into you is about your genitals. And this image that's out there now thanks to the porn industry couldn't be further from the truth but we have to deal with this fantasy of other people on daily base. We have to serve as the outlet of the depraved fantasies of other men. This unhealthy bias affects mostly trans women, as far as I know. I don't know why, but guys think it's super hot if a woman has a dick - which isn't the problem. The problem is when we're solely reduced to our genitals and that's the case very often. I want to be seen as an individual with feelings and desires and not as a cock attached to a female body. I'm more than just ""trans"". Anyway, here is the link to said study.

Loneliness Megathread,1340345,littlelungs,"Sep 24, 2021 at 10:15 AM","Aw, thank you. I'm glad that my posts are at least somewhat intelligible to other people, haha. That eases my mind a bit.

People just generally give me anxiety and I'm admittedly very sensitive to rejection when I *do* put myself out there, and I always feel like no matter what I say, it's stupid and nobody wants to hear it... which could very well be true, but that doesn't mean it doesn't feel bad and that the mere thought of people judging me doesn't nag away at me while I'm writing up a post. There have been quite a few times where I've wanted to participate in a discussion but felt like everything I was saying was all wrong, or I just couldn't get the thoughts out at all. Again, I just have a really difficult time expressing myself between the brain fog, invalidation, trauma, anxiety etc, and the fact that I often feel like words are simply inadequate.

As for not being completely bitter... I'm not gonna lie, it's hard not to be, but more than anything, I'm just so fucking tired. This life has beaten me to a pulp and I take solace in the fact that every passing day is one day closer to finally getting some actual god damn rest.

And at the risk of sounding like a self-righteous prick (here I go again with the disclaimers), I think a good part of why I try to show as much empathy and compassion towards others as I possibly can, is because I know how awful it feels to constantly be treated like absolute garbage and the kind of long-term consequences that it can have on a person, and I just want to (at least) be one less asshole in their life – and I think this is the case for a lot of others as well. It's also just always been important to me that other people feel welcome and included, so whenever I see someone who's lonely (and doesn't want to be) I just feel for them so much. It truly breaks my heart to read all of these posts, and I admit I shed a few tears because of it.

However, the way I see it now is more like a road to rest instead of being miserable until the end, a goodbye video from a girl I knew (and from what I learned in this forum, there is a good possibility she was here) who ctb made me have peace with it. She said she was happy and she looked calm and beautiful, instead of looking horrible in depressed.

Initially I was planning to hang myself since I already knew it was impossible to do it with pills (in general) and cutting wrists, but I was afraid of the pain or worse, that something would go horrible wrong and I would be rescued or get stuck and die of starvation. My plan was almost finished, I already had done my research on ropes, was gonna order the rope and things to put in the ceiling to attach the rope; only thing left was to learn the knot. Searching about it took me here.

Then I learned about SN and oh, that was so fucking good. The chance to not having to suffer excruciating pain until the end and be ""sure"" it would work...

Now I am waiting for SN to arrive (I already ordered, here it isn't restricted, yay) and the meds I already bought. I'm still indecisive about the date (but not about ctb), could be from mid October of this year (SN should arrive around that time) if I want to ""leave in a hurry"" until October of the next year. Most probably will be in the first half of April, by that time I already will have ""put things in order"" and enjoy life a little without dreading about the horrible future that waits me (not that things are ""good"" now, but ik my future will be so so so so much worse if I stay alive).

I panic every time I have to communicate someone, even if I just have to write an email or a post. I'm also just really bad at communicating my feelings and thoughts. Sorry.

In any case, for the last five months I have been preparing for the SN method. I already have antiemetics and antacids, but I have trouble getting SN itself. I am trying to find a source that ships to Spain, but preferably based in Spain. The problem is, most of the companies I have contacted ask for my company name, so I gather they don't sell products to private individuals.

Now, I have a corporate email from my university, but I don't know if that will slide, since my university is not only outside of Spain, but outside of the EU in general. So I doubt I can give them my tax data. Also, they sell it in 25kg bags which is way more than I need.

They could close their eyes and look away, too. It's hard to think of it from a normal non suicide perspective. If I were the driver I'd just think it was tragic that it came to that for the person you jumped in front. I'd think that at least they are never going to suffer again and are free from whatever was hurting them now. I wouldnt blame myself for someone jumping in front.

Railway Suicide Viability and Information Request,2677848,Scythe,"Sep 21, 2024 at 11:33 PM","So ideally you will jump when the train is going inbetween stations, not when the train is about to dock.
I suggest looking at the train and how fast it goes a few times before you attempt so you have a general idea of the speed.
You also have to take into account the train doesn't have to be going at full speed to kill you, and regardless of the train, it cannot just snap to a halt when the driver slams on the brakes. So you probably have a longer window of time to jump than you think, you should try to avoid jumping too late because I believe that's when the train doesn't kill you.",,,,,,,,,,
My meds + dnm,2677841,flippingtick,"Sep 21, 2024 at 11:26 PM","So I have quite alot of prescription meds available to me, as well as the ability to get dnm. I am hoping to take a trip to Peru to get N, but also want some backup methods if I am unsuccessful. I may also be able to get some SN, but unsure about that as well. At worst I'll resort to a gun, but I'd rather find a more peaceful method. I recognize thate benzos + ondasteron could be helpful for SN or N.

Would any of these medications be useful for ctb either alone or together with some other combination that can easily be acquired via dn? As far as I can find, most of them either would not be, or would be far less than peaceful. I would like something pretty-bullet proof. I have considered morphine + alcohol + benzos, but that sounds pretty hit or miss. I know Duloxetine can be lethal in high enough dosages, but that basically means dying of serotonin syndrome afk.

Temazepam (around 1800mg)
Ativan (Around 30mg)
Diazepam (Around 200mg)
Guanfacine (Around 400mg)
Mirtazapine (Around 2700mg)
Duloxetine (Around 10k+mg)
Ondasteron (Unsure exact amount, but enough to be helpful)

I miss my dog,2673931,Manfrotto99,"Sep 18, 2024 at 7:00 AM","I lost my dog about five months ago. I've totally lost track of time. Every day I have cried and felt the pain of missing her. I wake up thinking how will I get through another day without her. It isnt getting easier, today was exceptionally hard and painful as spring is starting here. A time we used to love to spend walking and in the garden together. I would wake up, give her a kiss and sing to her. I thanked God every day for her. She was in a lot of pain towards the end with stomach cancer but she rarely showed it.

I never had my own children. I feel so alone. She was all I had. I felt this way when my dog before her passed, but getting her as a puppy helped me to get over the grief and pain. I have had dogs for the past 30 years and I am lost without one. A part of me has died and i dont know who I am anymore. I know this is not normal but she was all I had and she kept me strong, she softened my heart, she calmed me and kept me going through intense stress and turmoil, that has not changed.

They were both collies, the lassie kind. I find some peace knowing they are together keeping one another company, waiting for me. I cannot afford another dog and my siutaion wont allow it. This won't change. I am scared of dying but I'm looking forward to being with them again in a garden.",,,,,,,,,,

After reading your post, I now have a waterfall of tears flowing .

I also lost my fur baby on 11/11/23. She (Hazel) had a mammory tumor. She MADE IT THROUGH SURGERY!..I was SOOOO SOOO HAPPY!....but did not make it through the night post-op at the vet(I'm pretty sure they didn't monitor her well through the night..& my girl was a SMART Doggy..so I imagine her prob getting past the funnel neck thing and licking her wounds until she likely broke stitches & bled out().
I ""THOUGHT"" I was otw to p/u my pup of 12 yrs the next day!...but that wasn't the case. They didn't even call me. I got the news when I called and asked was it ok to pick her up?!(SMDH!)

Even tho she was older, I JUST KNOW!..as spunky and happy as she was...she wdv still had at least a few or more years. She was a lab/pit mix.

I never got to have children either..& I swear she was the CLOSEST thing I would ever know...so again, I can also relate

Time does heal to SOME EXTENT. ..but TBH, I'm STILL GRIEVING. I have ALWAYS taken any type of losses extremely HARD though. I'm a huge empath, so I believe that contributes even in some odd way of having like 'double the emotions' on losses. Idk.

Why can't dogs (& cats) have life spans of humans it makes you think and want!..

I hate how bias the assisted suicide community is against mental illness. Even to those who believe in the right to die mentally ill people are infantalized and discounted. As with physically ill assisted suicide, I believe you should have to prove you've done enough to attempt to get better and there is valid reason to believe you will not achieve quality of life, but fuck we shouldn't be excluded. Do the majority of people with mental illness live meaningful lives with reasonable quality, or even make full recovery? Yes. But not everyone. We are not a monogamy. Mental illness is a broad range from a little social anxiety to debilitating suicidal depression.

I'm so angry tonight that I will die alone and likely in a certain degree of pain. I will be risking severe damage to my heart and brain if I survive. I will be in a shitty hotel room and never get to say goodbye to my loved ones. My death will be processed as a crime scene. My family may or may not get to see my last words in my journals, depending on if the police release them. I will be subjected to an unwanted autopsy. My family will be blindsided by my death. They will not get to say a proper goodbye. All because people don't believe in the right to die for people with mental illness, no matter how much of a fight they put in. No matter how long and how horribly we suffer. We don't get the luxury we give to our cats and dogs. We have to die in horrible circumstances. And it's not fucking fair. I'm so fucking angry.

All taken times to reach peak effects at the same time. Once the sedation starts to hit I'm putting a bag over my head for a double whammy with suffocation. All alone in a hotel room with no goodbye.

Maybe I'm too fatigued from reading so many THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD KILL ME posts to revognise the difference between puerile juvenilia and a plea for dignity but essentially it reads the same. Ultimately this is a political discussion, and assisted suicide will come sooner than we presently think. For every suicidal person who takes it up, twenty non-suicidal people who see themselves as economically burdensome, are denied healthcare due to their financial status, or are just generally working class and tired, will follow.

But with a reasonable attempts and time given I do believe that the Right to Die movement as a whole infantalizes mentally ill people. Those who are pro Death with Dignity will say that it is an outrage that physically ill people cannot access a peaceful death and it should be much more readily available. The second any mental health condition is brought up they do a 180 and we all ""just need a little help"". No ifs ands or buts. I'm not asking the government to kill me. I'm hoping one day there will be an option for the terminally mentally ill to be able to say goodbye to their families. To not die in a cheap, dirty hotel room with no one to hold their hand.

I lament this but recognise why it should be.

Logistically yes, from a standpoint of the people who can actually move legislation it comes down to economic class and who can pay the big bucks to make it financially worth taking you out.

So I know this is speaking from a purely emotional standpoint, but having been failed by both sides of the medical profession, I feel, well, can we say we deserve something without necessarily being owed it? Because even if they still don't owe it to me to actually be useful for once, I still I feel I deserve it.

Bear in mind OP isn't just talking about the pathology of the death or how it goes down when she talks about dignity. She also means not having to die in the shadows all alone. Also people in the world have received assisted death on the basis of non-terminal suffering so since there is that precedent it makes sense to long for it for yourself, right?

I'll be doing the stat dose. But taking 40 mg of metoclopramide instead of 30. Also, I'll be doing 33 g of SN in approximately 100 ml of water instead of the recommended 25. I know that a higher quantity might make it more likely that I'll throw up, but I'll be preparing 3 glasses of 33 g SN total in case I throw up.

I want to use up all of my 100 g in this attempt, rather than saving a quarter of the SN or something which would be pretty useless. If it doesn't work this time, I'll just have to find a different method. Although I don't really have any access to any, so I'm really REALLY hoping this works.

Ambien + alcohol,2668853,measuremeasure,"Sep 13, 2024 at 2:42 PM","Hello all.

I'm looking for advice on a method. I am prescribed ambien and xanax and know that they both contribute to respiratory depression, especially combined with alcohol. I made an unsuccessful attempt a couple of years ago where I didn't drink enough when ODing, and was found by my partner after sort of waking up.

Currently these are the only medications I have access to. SN seems really upsetting to me, and I'm physically squeamish: I want to overdose peacefully and just go to sleep and never wake up. Barbituates would be ideal for this but it looks like no one can find or access them.

I don't weigh much and have a low alcohol tolerance. I don't typically use drugs aside from ambien to sleep. I've considered adding something like fentanyl (taken orally) if I can get access to it. Is there a chance of any of this working? What would I need to add to get it to work? I really cannot afford to have another failed attempt. I've heard of people dying from accidental overdose of sleeping pills + xanax + alcohol so it seems like a possibility if I get my BAC up enough.",,,,,,,,,,
Ambien + alcohol,2668906,maniac116,"Sep 13, 2024 at 3:47 PM","Honestly ODs rarely work. You may wake up in a psych ward or ICU with organs damaged. Benzos are not reliable for CTB, and alcohol will mess your liver up, especially in combo with other drugs.

I gave it to kids in the ICU basically every day. Benzos are used for all sorts of stuff, including in epilepsy, but yes very common for alcoholics because it acts like alcohol in pill form in some ways and prevents seizures and other withdrawal symptoms. But, it also has the very similar withdrawal symptoms such as seizures, so it's robbing Peter to pay Paul. As far as other barbiturates, one that is still pretty easily available is in a mixture drug, fioricet, which contains a mixture of butalbital, acetaminophen/paracetamol/tylenol, and caffeine. If you were to take that drug the most likely thing to kill you unfortunately is the acetaminophen. I haven't looked into it but if there was a way to get butalbital by itself it would theoretically work if administered correctly, but it's unlikely to be reliable.

How would i order SN without my parents questioning the package?,2677681,shadow999,"Sep 21, 2024 at 8:26 PM","I'm in a similar predicament. From what I've read here DMC does not label the outside with anything to do with SN, one example I remember is something about pottery. You just have to keep an eye on the tracker I guess. I ordered mine about a week ago and am still waiting. My best plan is to get it in without my parents noticing, however my father regularly works from home so I might have to stick it in the woods or something then obtain it later. If I can't do that and they ask about it I'm just gonna say it's a book or is art supplies. I wish you the best of luck here.

When did you start to seriously consider CBT?,2668069,w4ntingtoletgo,"Sep 12, 2024 at 10:46 PM","For me it was the past year or so. I didn't know there was a specific name for it until a couple months ago. ""Passive suicidal ideation"". I've spent half of my life like this before it eventually changed to a clear intention. It was always a thought sitting in the back of my mind, like a shadow in the background of every memory. It felt like a close but somehow still very remote possibility, kind of a freak accident that would be very unlikely to take place but still could if the right conditions permitted it. But then, after so much time, after so many punishments given by life and so many unanswered prayers and efforts, I began thinking what it would have been like to actually take my life and the illusion of a chance started to dissipate slowly. It started off as a ""I will do it in 10 years"". Then they turned into 8, then 5, then 2, and then into a ""as soon as I get the chance to do so"".

I guess it took me so much time because I liked to believe that it would be like what we see in books and movies, where even if you suffer like hell you're still able to make it out alive and well and you get a happy ending. Because it can't end like this, right? But it's just a lie. It can and will end like this. Some lives are just tragedy and nothing else. I prayed and pleaded for something or someone to save me, but nothing and no one ever did. And I surely can't. I thought the universe wouldn't give up on me, that it would fight to let me stay, that I mattered, but I don't. I never did. I'm not one in a million, I'm just one desperate person among many.

I also think I lasted all this time because I clung to the hope that the remote possibility of healing meant being able to completely erase who I have been up until now and become a new person, but that's not possible. I would always be forced to bring this burden with me. I don't even think healing would work with me anymore tbh. I'm too far gone, too detached from everything and everyone.

So this is it. If only I had known earlier, I certainly wouldn't have resisted this much for nothing. I wish I hadn't been such an idiot. I just wanted to put the truth out somewhere.",,,,,,,,,,

I thought about methods somewhat but, not very in depth. We didn't have the internet back then (in the dark ages) though, so- that's partly why. Less resources to even know what to do.

In my later teenage years and onwards from that, I switched between passive and active ideation. Things have become a lot more serious in the past few years though in terms of preparing a method ready (SN.)",,,,,,,,,,
When did you start to seriously consider CBT?,2668263,Trav1989,"Sep 13, 2024 at 2:16 AM","Damn, yeah... Once you get into your 30's and 40's a single large traumatic event can derail your entire life very easily. Your old enough that you can't easily recover (if at all) but too young to know that you can just forget about it as your time is nearing it's natural end. When the event that began the end for me began around this time last year when I suspected my wife was cheating after catching her talking to guys and bringing home a lot of extra money I had mentally prepared myself for CTB, when she admitted to cheating on me with dozens of random men a few months back and left I knew my time was up. Finally managed to scrounge up enough money a week ago to order SN after being stupid and blowing all my money on alcohol for months and I can almost say that I'm finally happy now that everything is going to end soon.

It was a year of trauma and after I saw her wallet filled with over $2000 while the bills were hardly getting paid and she was staying overnight at a ""friends"" house so she could be closer to ""therapy"" because she didn't want to wake up to early and her ""friend"" lived closer 2-3 times a week I just couldn't bring myself to be intimate with her. Then when she tried to explain to me that it wasn't cheating if she didn't love the other men and I'd get a third of the ""donations"" along with her ""friend"" AKA pimp if I was cool with it I just mentally snapped.

If I had SN at that moment I would have driven many miles out of town and just ended things at the nearest secluded area.

In many ways I wish I had done such then because every day I continue on is more difficult than the last and I can't start over. I tried dating again and it's just too difficult to start over after I invested everything I had into that relationship.

Then her friend sent me pictures and told me that my wife was seeing anywhere from 5-10 guys a night and then told me I could get a third of the money like I was a business partner, he even offered to pay me in drugs while I was on the other end of the phone in complete shock and about to faint, of course I called the cops and they did nothing because apparently what was going on wasn't even illegal other than him offering to pay me in drugs but he was never arrested to my knowledge.

Then a couple months later she gets beat up by some random guy and claimed that I did it to her but hadn't even seen her since she left at that point.

The fact that her therapist convinced her to reach out to her old friends that she missed from school and then all of that happened and now she is on drugs and doing guys and doesn't even know who she is anymore and she CHOSE that blows my mind.

Just traumatic event after traumatic event until I just mentally broke, I filed for divorce and got it at least so I can die knowing I'm not married to her anymore.

Sorry, maybe I vented a bit too much on this but every day just gets harder because I can't bring myself to comprehend how greedy and evil other humans can be, I knew things were bad but they are so much worse than I ever knew.

I lived a fairly normal life prior to this event, with relatively normal relationships and then out of the 5-6 or so relationships I was in the woman I chose to marry did that. It wasn't even my longest relationship and things started going that bad in 4-5 years?

I'd say that was the point I definately started considering CTB and why I plan on doing so soon. I just can't go on knowing this happened and I'll never be able to free my memory of it and in all honesty, even having to wait another 10 days or so feels like torture to me. I've dealt with this trauma for a year now and I just can't handle it anymore.

If I'll have one regret to take with me when I CTB it will be that I didn't select faster shipping for SN.",2668225,,,,,,,,,

As for the water to SN ratio, it's 2:1. So for 25g of SN, 50ml of water would make it 2:1. And the generally advised amount of SN under 100kg body weight (so even if you're 45kg like myself) is 25g.",,,,,,,,,,

Great Difficulty Acquiring Meto/Antiemetic in Canada,2591987,JotCBT,"Jul 10, 2024 at 4:20 PM","I have now tried 3 times to get meto, 1 via pharmacy, 1 via walk in clinic and 1 via online doctor/text chat, and all 3 times have failed. I will document each one here. Please, if you have any advice for someone living in Ontario Canada, let me know. I only need antiemetic and then I can finally get on with this.

Attempt 1:

I tried to base what I was saying off some of my own personal health truths. So I mentioned that I previously had cancer and that during my chemotherapy they gave me meto to help with my nauseau and vomiting. I told him that the last few days I felt the exact same way as I did then and was wondering if it was possible to get some. He took me in for a mini checkup, using some sort of digital survey to ask me questions about symptoms. After the survey, the computer determined that I need to see a doctor and so he didn't give me anything.

Attempt 2:

I went to a walk in clinic and saw a doctor there. I told him that yesterday I was experiencing severe migraine and nauseau, as well as vomiting. I told him this happens every 2-3 months and that it usually lasts a day or two. I told him that my family doctor had no diagnosis and that she told me to try otc things like gravol and pepto bismo. I said those things had little to no effect. I said that I once tried meto on a road trip to Quebec where a pharmacy gave it to me as a sample.

He basically said meto is a very strong medication administered in hospitals for vomiting. He instead prescribed me imitrex df 100mg to deal with the migraine first, since he believes the vomiting and nauseau are symptoms of the migraine.

Attempt 3:

I then tried an online service that I had to pay for, and sent them this message:

I seem to have a vomiting episode 3-4 times a year or so, for about 2-3 years. I can usually feel when an episode is going to happen because I will get a pretty bad migraine followed by nausea and the vomiting. It doesn't really last longer than 1-2 days but when it does happen it is pretty bad and I have to take the day off. I've seen my family doctor about it in the past and because it's so infrequent there was no diagnosis, and I was recommended OTC items like pepto bismol and gravol. I've tried those items with little to no effect. Then my doctor tried prescribing me Imitrex DF 100mg and that also had little effect for me. One time when it was really bad, I was given a sample of metocroplamide? I believe it was called? This was during a road trip in quebec where I was given a small dosage at a pharmacy. That was the only time I felt like it was made better. I was wondering if this is something that could be prescribed to me?

He asked me what symptoms I was having and i said vomiting, nauseau, migraine, gagging. He asked me how many times I vomited and I said at least 5. He then said to go to ER because I likely need IV antiemetic and IV rehydration. As a desperate last attempt I said that I can't leave my home right now and would he please prescribe me something? He refused and said to go to ER.",,,,,,,,,,

I don't know why I'm saying this and it may not help, so please excuse me if I'm off base. Somewhere in the early 2000s, I went on vacation to the ocean and went out drinking. I wound up sitting next to a retired police officer who was about as drunk as I was. He mentioned he had witnessed three suicides and one murder (or perhaps it was 3 murders and one suicide, I just can't remember now). I asked him how he dealt with it and he laughed and said he drank alcohol. A few minutes went by and I told him that I had witnessed a murder when I was 6 and had so much guilt and that I just did not know how to deal with it, so could he please tell me how he dealt with it? As drunk as hell as I was, I will never forget this or his voice: he said ""I sat with it and let it sit with me.""

I thought about what he said all week and realized that I had to just sit with the feelings of guilt, shame, terror, helplessness, anger, and hatred for the murderers and nothing I felt was bad or wrong. It took me years to understand that I could only deal with my real role in the murder, which I did not have because I was a kid. It took a long - and I do mean a damn long time - to let go of it. It was not my fault and I know that now.

That man does not know it, but he saved my life and sanity that night. Every year, when I have been able to afford a vacation, I always go to the same bar and look for him because I want him to know he was the reason I was able to let go of that hell. I want to thank him. But, I have never found him and the bartender told me he never had seen the man before that night and never saw him again.

This is kind of a spiritual thing so I hope it does not offend or insult you, that is not my desire. Samhain (Halloween) is supposedly the night the veil between the living and dead is the thinnest. On Samhain, I make an ""alter"" for those who have died that were important to me. I put up pictures, flowers, and things they liked while they were alive, like my biological grandfather liked Grey Goose, so I put a bottle there. It's a way to connect with those that have crossed over. I then look for signs from my ancestors that I've made a connection. Mostly, that has just been dreams. Who knows if anything is really happening, but even if it isn't, it helps me to express the grief and love for those who I've lost.

No matter what path you take, I hope you can find peace. In my opinion, your son's death was not your fault.",,,,,,,,,,

Thank you so much @uglyugly for sharing your experience and it's true you had no role in the murder and it wasn't your fault. But my son was just a child needed protection from whatever he was going through and I didn't provide that. I go to his grave twice daily I change flowers and sometimes I close my eyes hoping to hear his voice. I just want to see him one more time maybe he didn't know how much I loved him. Maybe he thought he was alone when he decided to die. I'm feeling guilty and that's the worst part of my grief. He wanted to live he asked me about Disney land two days before. I'm going crazy I feel that I'm losing my mind. There is no way I can live with this painful grief. I feel bad my dad just came this evening and brought me iPhone 16 as a gift. Everyone wants to help me but what's the point nothing is helping. Right now as I'm tying this my headache is killing me. My grief and depression are effecting me physically slowly in seeing decline.

But they will be if you go. I think it's not uncommon to want to give up on support groups, but try at least a few full meetings. Even that person you described, we don't know what's going on underneath. I can never understand your pain, but I hope you really try before you give up. Even the meds, not to push any meds but sometimes you just need something to knock you out so you can at least sleep. Ask your doc about something stronger just for now. During one of my lowest periods, i couldn't shut my brain off and couldn't sleep and that made everything worse. Talk to your doc instead of just not taking them. For your family if not yourself, there is still more to try before you give up.

In the mean time, living with grieving mom like me with my symptoms that escalate daily is not healthy for them either. I love them so much they are so beautiful and innocent. It's heart breaking to do that to them I know. It's awful.
I can't comprehend that the person I loved so much the person I used to cover in the middle of the night so he won't catch a cold from the AC shot himself not knowing how much I can do to help him and how much I love him. I will die for my son but he didn't know. My life turned upside down the day my son died. No going back my world ended too the world I'm living at now is just darkness no light. The day my son died I died. We didn't celebrate holidays or enjoyed any meals. I isolate myself and pushed friends away. I become someone I can't recognize.

I decided to kms,2677029,Forever Sleep,"Sep 21, 2024 at 8:05 AM","I very much doubt you did trigger your son's depression. From what you've said before, you didn't abuse him or anything. Maybe you missed some 'signs' but I feel it's more likely he tried his best to hide how he truly felt. Plus, honestly, if you had been all over him over things you suspected- that may not have helped either. Parents who smother their children aren't always all that benficial either. There may not have actually been anything you could have done to help or stop him.

I first had ideation aged 10. I never told my parents. Brutally honestly, there maybe were things my Dad did that contributed to it all. I still wouldn't blame him though. Feeling suicidal is complex. Relationships are complex. But ultimately, we can't act on things we don't know about and we also have a right to keep things private if we don't want to talk about them.

I think I can maybe understand a bit of how you feel. Maybe that this has changed you so much as a person that, you can no longer be the parent you want to be for your other children. It's hard to know what to say really. I suppose my bias seeing as I lost my Mum when I was 3 is that I would prefer still to have known her- whoever she was.

I don't think this is something you get over quickly though. I'm sure it takes years. It's just so difficult feeling awful for all involved.",,,,,,,,,,
I decided to kms,2677039,willitpass,"Sep 21, 2024 at 8:27 AM","I can't say I know a damn thing about what it's like to lose a child, I don't even have children. But I do understand the feeling of your mind going 1000 miles a minute and being unable to calm down. The feeling of everything moving too fast and spiralling down the drain and only seeing one way out. I understand that much. And through all of what I've gone through, that is one feeling that I can tell you does calm eventually. I have wanted to make many rash decisions when in that mental state that looking back at when I calm down I know I would have regretted. I'm not saying that when the emotional tornado passes it will all be well and good and you'll have peace and all of the grief and trauma and desire to join him will have passed, but the intense urge to just do anything and everything to escape will. You will be able to think with a more level head.

Please try and wait for the emotional storm to calm before you make a decision. You love your kids. All three of them. And you will have eternity to love your son as strongly as a good mother can. But your other two children not only need your love, they need your care too. They need someone to hug them goodbye to school. They need someone to talk about how amazing their brother was and is to. They need someone to walk them through break ups and boyfriends and girlfriends. It's not fair that your other son has lost that. I can't even imagine. But I urge you to wait for emotions to settle before you make a decision that would mean your other two children lose that too. If that is a decision that is going to be made I really hope it is with a calm and collected mind, not one running on adrenaline and panic and sleeplessness.

I don't have the magic key to how to let things calm. I know time isn't a good answer as it never feels like there is time to wait when things feel like that. I hope some of the options others have left above are helpful to you. You seem like an amazing mother, even if grief has clouded your view of yourself. I truly hope that through this unimaginable loss you are able to find a way to carry of for yourself and your family while you grieve.",,,,,,,,,,
I decided to kms,2677159,-Link-,"Sep 21, 2024 at 10:54 AM","I assure you, I know you are dealing with something that I or most other members here or most healthcare professionals or most people on the entire planet can't even begin to wrap their brains around.

There are no words that could ever make anyone fully understand what you're going through unless they, themselves, have experienced it.

I don't think ""a support group"" is going to do it.

I don't think a support group for parents who have lost children is going to do it.

I don't even think a support group for parents who have lost children to suicide is going to do it. It's close, but it might not be quite enough.

What I would really like to see for you is for you to connect with other parents who have lost young adolescent children to suicide. That tiny age range of 13-to-15. It's a special age for teenagers, and it's a special age for parents. I think you need help getting through this from other people who have very specifically gone through exactly what you have -- or as close to it as possible.

This is how you get through unimaginable, seemingly insurmountable grief. You seek out support from people who truly know what it is to be in your position because they are living it too. Let these people help you. In doing this, you're not only setting yourself up to improve your ability to cope with this and survive for the longer term, but you will also be helping them because this is a part of their healing process too: Helping other parents who are enduring the same experience. And once you reach a certain point, you will be able to do the same for other people in your position.

Grief support groups, doctors, therapists, and other mental health practitioners: Yes, these people can help you too, and I'd absolutely encourage you to seek out support from all possible sources. But I think you're going to get the most effective help and support from other people who are literally living it themselves.

How do you find these people? You ask your family. You ask your friends. You ask friends of friends. You ask your mental healthcare workers. You ask your neighbours. You ask your coworkers and supervisors. You ask around on social media. You ask random strangers on the street, even. You can ask anyone you want because your story is unique from most other people on this forum or in any support group you'll ever attend. You lost your teenage son to suicide. This is something that will instantly resonate with just about 100% of the human population. It stops people dead in their tracks and makes them react with a ""holy fucking god"" that allows them to immediately hear you loud-and-clear. They may have no idea what to say to you -- and it's important that you allow them this, their inability to even put words to what they'd like to say. They want to say something, they just have no idea how to do it because your pain is absolutely incomprehensible to them. But you can use this to your advantage and get other people to help you in what's maybe the only way a lot of people can: Let them network for you. There are other parents out there who are going through the exact same experience you are, and they are surviving. Let other people in your life -- or even total strangers -- find these people for you and connect you to them.

You're never going to get over this. The pain will always be there. But it is possible to make a certain peace with it so that you and it can coexist. How do you do that? I have absolutely no idea. But I do know it is possible because there are other people in your position doing it. Find these people. Reach out to them. Let them help themselves, by helping you.

These people will be your new best friends. Your life ended when your son died. The ""old you"" is gone and never coming back. The ""old you"" was living an average life and able to relate to the average person who was living the same kind of average life. The ""new you"" doesn't have this benefit. The ""new you"" is living a life that only a small fraction of people on the entire planet are living. Find these people, and let them into your new life.

There are parents of young adolescents all around the world right now, and some of these parents are going to lose their child to suicide. It might be next month. It might be next year. It might even be tomorrow. It's going to happen, and these parents have no idea it's coming. When it hits them... whatever you're feeling right now, that's what they're going to be going through.

You could get yourself into a very unique position to be able to help these people like no one else can. And in doing so, you'd be helping yourself too. Helping yourself, by helping others.

You can do this. I have absolutely no idea how it's possible. I imagine almost every other member who's ever been on this forum has absolutely no idea how it's possible.

But for these other parents you could find and reach out to and connect with? They know. They are living proof that long-term survival is possible. Find them, and let them join your surviving children as the center of your new life.

I have been through a lot of pain and suffering in my life. Nothing even remotely close to yours, but suicide has been my ""companion"" for quite a long time.

Early on, I did a lot of research about it. Not just about the usual stuff with methods, survivability, etc. but also on what I'd be doing to my family if I followed through with it.

I tried so hard to rationalize it. I read so many stories. I looked everywhere for stories from survivors of suicide loss trying to find a justification or rationalization to be able to tell myself that it was OK to put my family through it. I was never able to find one. Not a single one. As best I could tell, it was universal: For whatever challenges their loved ones gave them in life, they'd rather have them back in their lives, even along with all their challenges.

If you have any doubt about this, try having a point-blank conversation with your children. Tell them how badly you're struggling and that you're feeling this strong, persistent urge to follow your son in death. Give them the option of discussing it with you. If we lived in a more progressive society and everyone had access to government-provided assisted dying services, then this is a conversation you would have with them. Give them the opportunity to tell you and show you that they need you in their lives and that they are better off with you than without, even at your very lowest lows. It might be an absolutely godawful, challenging conversation to have, but if the other option is death -- your children losing you without even an opportunity to talk about it -- then have the conversation with them and give them the chance. (Editing to add: If your children are still minors, of course you'd have to be extra cautious here, so if they're minors, maybe a ""direct approach"" is not for the best. But maybe a very careful conversation could still be had. Maybe your sister might be able to help with something like this? Only you could be the judge of whether this option is approachable.)

Just quoting this for emphasis because I think it's an astute point. We will support you as best we can whenever we can, but definitely try to be mindful of how much time you're spending here.

I think, also, the story from @uglyugly about learning to sit with it is pretty spot-on as far as what survival can look like. While I'm not sure I'm equipped to meaningfully comment on this as a concept, I really do believe that if you could connect with other parents in your specific position and give them a chance to help you, you might surprise yourself in the end and actually learn how to ""sit with it"" -- how to move forward. Not ""move on,"" but ""move forward.""

All the emotion and guilt and grief I've seen from you over the past month, I absolutely 100% completely utterly positively wholeheartedly believe in you as a parent, and I really believe you have it in you -- somewhere within you -- to do this and survive for yourself and for your children.",2676739,2676717,2676739,2676746,,,,,,

I'm a very sad person. I can't even smile the normal way I fake my smile. I don't know why this happened to me to my son he was so innocent. Life is so ugly and not worth living without him. I remember him coming down the stairs with his beautiful smile and as he's walking by he used to say ""love you"" that's how we used to say hi with ""love you"". He loved animals he had a big heart he was a giver.

The thing is if I fixed or even bettered this problem I might be able to go on just for the sake of my family but I am not sure if I can if I don´t find a solution to this problem because it´s insufferable it´s such a curse and a rare one at that since I have never met or heard of anyone suffering from the same which would be a good comfort to know I was the only person in the world with this illness.

I can definitely also feel what you mean by getting thrown back by your illnesses if I could remove the above problem I would be able to try and take the leap into life, although my anxieties would hold me back a lot but with the constant suffering I feel from the problem it´s impossible to even consider the leap of faith.",,,,,,,,,,
Who here suffers from chronic pain or other chronic ailments?,2654326,CatLvr,"Sep 1, 2024 at 5:52 PM","Man, the wall if text I would have -- sheesh.

Instead of listing everything I'll just give you a general rundown -- chronic headaches of several types, some of which are untreatable, chronic pain from injuries suffered at the hands of relatives growing up, chronic spinal and nerve pain from injuries in a car crash that should have killed me (no more seat belts for me).

So that's it in a nutshell. I have hurt more in my life than I have not (the first time I didn't have a headache I was in middle school and had actually managed to stop the physical abuse I had been subjected to by telling my main abuser I would kill her if she ever touched me again. About a month after that I woke up without a headache and thought that I was having a stroke because my vision was actually clear, not fuzzy. Doc at the ER was aghast but I figured it out (not that I said anything to anybody) about halfway through his exam.

Now I just hurt all the time because pain management is afraid I will become a junkie if they actually treat my pain appropriately. Don't want me to get started about that. So I basically am just waiting on the pain to get bad enough again to motivate myself to ctb. The surgeries they did to help with the spinal pain help with the acute pain, but so nothing for the dull throb that is still there, and now I have neuropathy from them burning those nerves. Plus, it's a temporary fix for me. Will only lasy about 6 to 8 months and then I have to start all over again. It's too much. All I am doing is trading one type of pain for another.
I have seen some videos of a gal who only eats red meat, salt and water. Mikhaila Peterson. She had a bunch of inflammatory issues (some of her symptoms sounded like some of yours) and went on a really strict elimination diet. That's how she figured out that she basically couldn't eat anything but red meat. No joke.

(And don't anybody come after me, I won't entertain your posts. All I know is that's her story, and it's what lead me to trying an elimination diet and finding out I am sensitive to several things.)",2654320,,,,,,,,,

And I bet you already have tried asking multiple doctors? Maybe even trying to tell a shrink how much the physical pain causes you mental suffering and dance lightly around ctb without ever mentioning the word so they know you really mean it, I don´t know what else you can do if you haven´t already tried this but then again with your problems and mine as well we are just postponing the envitable, I certainly don´t see myself suffering from my illnesses that only gets worse year by year for decades more.

Thanks I´ll look it up, I have been researching it for some time though the carnivore diet and I am once again trying to get the courage to try it but the thing is my throat is chronically very tight because of the allergic reactions so I can´t just eat a 500-600 kcal of steak in one sitting it would literally be impossible for me to get down but this diet might work so ironically I can´t start the diet because my throat is tight from my current diet and I would lose a lot of weight if I just tried eating what meat I could get down and I am small enough as it is. I can however get 400g of chicken thigh down in the morning I tried that but my throat doesn´t get better right away so it´s hard to tell if I am even allergic to certain meats, I just think I should be able to tolerate meats since it´s not a plant but I can´t say for certain and some are allergic to chicken so who knows if I am? But damn all that steak would be impossible unless it was Wagyu but I am not rich so that can´t happen, normal steak is too solid and rough to get down. I also have a very addictive personality so I can´t see how I could only eat meat for the rest of my life I even tried it a few months back I only managed a day and got 700g down and that was including some meats that were processed some so that was cheating it needs to be fresh meat. But I might just try again soon and take the consequence of losing weight, because if my throat got better it would make me feel so... happy I actually think I could start being a bit happy or looking brighter for the future but not now even writing this now my esophagus is so tight and dry it´s very uncomfortable to say the least.

For me, this shifted my focus to just getting through one day at a time. Not thinking about yesterday, or tomorrow. Just today.

This doesn't mean I've dismissed the idea of ""getting better"" -- it just means I don't worry about it anymore. If treatment happens to make things better, great. But I've let go of the idea of ""better"". This seems to have relieved a lot of that pressure that I used to put on myself, and it has allowed me to let go of some of the guilt and shame.

It's still very, very hard, and I still deal with a lot of guilt and shame... and I'm not sure what my future looks like... But otherwise, I did find some relief in this shift in mindset.

Now, some people might construe this as ""giving up."" But for me, I call it ""surviving.""

I don't know if this is the right thing to do. I don't know if it's right for me, or if it's right for anyone else. For all I know, I could reach a crisis point again and get totally derailed at some point. But this is what I'm doing right now.",,,,,,,,,,

Use little pressure if using a sharp blade (e.g. razor blade), though for the start a rather dull blade like the one of a used knife could prevent you from cutting too deep.

Addiction years apart families, ruins job opportunities, eats up medical services, and kills so many people. This is no different. Self harm ruins relationships, isolates people, takes up medical care, can cause severe damage or infections, and can kill people.

""except a cooperative group investing time and energy to build things they and their community needs"" and if someone disagrees with what has been determined as a need they will be vaporised and become a nonperson.

Why become an engineer if the food ration is the same as that of a passport-stamper? We might give an incentive to the engineer in form of more food and better housing. I am sure the engineer will not store food and exchange it with the masses for say washing his house.

But then this exchange of food is complicated. Ik let's make a big building to store the excess food and issue a receipt stating the amount of food that is deposited there, then the engineer can give the cleaner that paper, and the cleaner can pass along the paper. We should print it very well so that it cannot be forged.

LittleJem, you might have misunderstood, a nurse can have an opinion, it's true, but who ultimately decides about discharges in a psychiatric ward setting is a doctor.

Since there is absolutely no information about your condition and the setting, I myself don't know whether the nurse was wrong or not.

You might have been admitted for observation or exams. Once that is done, you leave. Public resources and beds are limited. Beds are for people who must sleep in a hospital because their condition is so bad that they cannot sleep at home.

Perhaps it was found out that day care would have been enough for you. I should like to say ""poor you"" but you don't say much.

Has a doctor said you should leave? Why?",,,,,,,,,,

I am hearing voices in my head, I feel like I have multiple personalities, I can't even think anymore. Like I don't even know how I'm putting all of this out onto this website, because I don't even know what I'm thinking. my brain is so blank, I can literally just lay in bed for hours and stare at my ceiling and have conversations with what seems like multiple people in my head. I'm hearing whispers and I'm seeing bugs and people in my peripheral vision and stuff and I feel like I'm going insane. I feel very abnormal. I'm always anxious, shaky, I always feel insanely depressed, it just never goes away. I feel like I have borderline personality disorder, but to be honest, I couldn't tell you why. I just relate with the symptoms so much and it's really difficult to even explain how I relate to them, and give examples of why, because I can't even think I can't even remember anything . Last night I was playing around with my boyfriend and I was like really happy and I was kind of on top of him and I was telling him ""shut the fuck up"" like I didn't even know I said it and I was like trying to be playful with him, and then, as soon as he started to show that he was upset, I immediately sat back and felt like something switched in my brain, and I was in ""little space"" And I was just trying to make him not mad at me anymore and figure out what I did wrong, like I had literally forgot that I had said that until another voice in my head told me what I said. I feel like I'm insane for saying that and I feel like everyone's gonna think that I'm making it up, but that's literally what is happening. I'm scared because I'm so self-aware, I'm just seeing all of these symptoms and connecting it with these mental disorders, and literally making myself insane, But I don't even know. I took shrooms earlier in August, and my first trip, I only took like a gram and a half, and it was a pretty good trip, I felt really happy and I was like ""oh I see why they want to treat depressed people with microdoses"" And after my trip was kind of off, I was telling my boyfriend oh my God I need more money for this. I need more money for it, and he literally withdrew $40 so we could buy more shrooms the next day. We did, and I ended up taking about 3 g, Doing about four g's shrooms within three days, and that was the worst trip in my life, I was dissociating to the max. I couldn't even walk inside of a store because I was freaking out, I was just so scared, I was so miserable and it's taken weeks to get back to feeling even remotely normal. i'm scared that I'm never gonna be normal again, I'm scared that I'm insane, I feel like I should just kill myself to feel better. I'm going to therapy now, and it's just really scary and unfortunate, because I love the idea of it, but having to plan it out and having to schedule times and be committed to it instead of just being able to be like hey can we do it today, makes me feel really anxious, I hate having to be set on things. I just feel like I let everyone down, I don't even know, there are so many things going on in my head yet nothing at all, I'm confused, I'm scared, and I really just want a way out. I really just don't wanna be here anymore. I wish I could kill myself. My mental health is only gonna get worse and worse and I just don't really see a point in trying to feel better, I feel like if I start to try to get better I will , have gone through everything for nothing and it'll just seem like I've made everything up in my head. What do I do? I feel like a failure, I just want my boyfriend to come here and lay with me, I'm really tired of being alone, I'm so so scared. I'm literally delusional, I genuinely believe that my boyfriend is vampire, I genuinely believe some of the teachers that my schools is a vampire, I believe that people around me are not human and I believe that everybody is watching me, I feel scared.

Being self-aware is good sometimes because it can keep you grounded with reality, sometimes. Borderline doesn't stick out to me just based on what you wrote. Psychosis does, and psychosis is often a lot more treatable than depression and anxiety in my experience, as in a big difference can be made. A lot more work has been put into actually treating psychosis rather than just making money off of it, like depression and anxiety. If psychosis was my chief problem, and I was self-aware enough to realize that, and I knew that a real difference could be made, I might look into getting help for it. Sure, a lot of the treatments are known to have pretty impactful side effects, but many people don't face significant side effects, some not at all.

As for whether or not you should give treatment try the antipsychotic(or if ur like me antipsychotic + antidepressant) and after 2-4 weeks where u genuinely feel more in the right state of mind, then evaluate if u still feel like continuing to ctb. Humans have the wonderful awareness that even when we aren't afflicted by significant pressures, our experiences and beliefs can still lead us to believe suicide is the answer. My advice is to just make sure it's you, not just the disorder which is causing your beliefs.

Help. Just diagnosed as bipolar,2650750,DeathSleep,"Aug 29, 2024 at 9:45 PM","I will share what happened to me and maybe it'll help in some little way. (or maybe not).

I went on the up and down roller coaster that is bipolar for years before I was diagnosed. Once diagnosed I was in denial even though it did make a lot of sense. I was put on a med that I kept going on and off of because I didn't believe I actually needed it. (I also seemed to think that the bipolar was kind of fun sometimes and it seemed like part of my identity or something because I'd always been like that.) Eventually I got so fed up with the bipolar that I gave the med another chance and I stayed on it for years finally realizing that it was in fact helping. That med was lithium. It seemed to help my bipolar but I got sick of the side effects that I put up with for far too long. Eventually I did stop taking it around the time that I took a whole bottle to CTB. (Before I realized how unreliable ODing is.) I was off meds for a few months then put on a different med... abilify. I greatly disliked the extreme restlessness that it caused but I stayed on it because it was keeping my bipolar in check and I didn't know what I should do at the time. The restlessness side effect eventually went away (after quite a while) and I'm still on it today. I'm actually kind of afraid to go off it now because of the side effect of starting it again but also because I know what it's like when I'm not doing anything for my bipolar.

Overall, does the med stop me from being bipolar? No. The swings are just not as extreme. I'm on an antidepressant as well. I don't know if it's because I'm a little older now but it seems exhausting looking back at what it was like and will be like if I stop my med. Sometimes I do miss being manic though. I have found that if I miss a day of taking my med I slip pretty hard into mania the next day. Which isn't as fun as it used to be for me.

That said, has being on a med for bipolar stopped me from wanting to CTB? For me, personally, that's a no. Being on a med may have actually made it a little harder to CTB though. I feel like I'd try more if I was super manic. I didn't feel like it hurt anything by trying meds for bipolar. Maybe it will change how you feel. Maybe it won't.

Sorry this got a little long.",,,,,,,,,,

does anyone actually feel good after venting?,2654505,minamin,"Sep 1, 2024 at 8:04 PM","So for me, I really don't like venting publicly or to other people. Especially because if you tweet ""I hate my life"", what is anyone else supposed to say? If you tell your friend out loud you want to CTB, they go ""Noo, don't do that"". And while that's a very nice sentiment, it does not change the fact I want to CTB. Someone offering to ""help"" me after hearing a fraction of how I actually feel doesn't make me feel better because I don't want help, I want a way out.

So then okay, if I can't vent irl, I'll vent in my diary. Pages and pages of thoughts. But that still doesn't change anything. It doesn't make me feel less miserable, just makes me reread it and go ""Yup, still depressed""…

And then here is SaSu. There are tons of venting threads here. I guess this thread in a meta way is venting too. But it's almost the same thing as writing in my diary… I don't feel better after and I end up deleting what I say almost 100% of the time.

And what's weird is… Despite saying all this, and despite knowing that it won't help me, I still think ""God, I want to tweet that I'm miserable! I want to hang out later with a friend and tell them I'm super depressed"". Even though I KNOW that I wont get any benefit from it. That it won't make me feel better and will just make me feel worse. But I still… want to vent!!!

I guess what I'm wondering is, does anyone actually feel better when they're getting things off their chest? And is there a reason the human mind is so paradoxical like this? I surely can't be the only one who feels this.

I don't know if it's better or worse to be able to at least tell people you're miserable. Well, I guess on this website everyone can do it.

Also, getting sympathy definitely helps. I avoid venting to specific people, and prefer to post online. I don't think it's wrong to vent to your friends, but I feel too guilty to do it for a variety of reasons. I don't think anyone else should feel this way, but I feel like making a random post puts less pressure on others to reply, so I prefer it",,,,,,,,,,

When you talk about feeling compelled to do it even though you know it doesn't work, it reminds me of how I have to be vigilant to not tell mandated reporters how miserable I am when they ask. I know that any satisfaction I might get from complaining to them and being ""seen"" isn't remotely worth the risk, and yet I have to actively hold myself back from doing it!

does anyone actually feel good after venting?,2677382,HereTomorrow,"Sep 21, 2024 at 3:24 PM","It depends on what it is and the medium.

In my teen years, I used to be borderline addicted to telling my friends I'm suicidial and the reasons why despite all the adults telling me to say it to the therapist instead of traumatizing my friends (which they eventually left me due to it, unsurprisingly). Venting about how much I want to die aided me in the short term in emotional relief, but by the next day I used to feel the same way. I'm pretty sure I got sent to the guidance office at my high school around 30 times in 4 years due to my friends being extremely concerned, but because I had no plan they never sent me to the hospital. But that initial relief felt too good to stop.

Now that I'm in my 20s, I'm a lot more careful with who I vent. In an emergency, I write in a mini journal I carry at all times which unloads the initial stress until I'm home. If I were to vent to a friend, I ask them explicit permission and ask if they're alright with it before I speak about everything but suicide, and so far I've never felt better unloading my thoughts, though it's less often I do it than before, maybe because they are able to listen and discuss what I said without panic or worry since they've prepared themselves.

Also here too. This place makes me feel safe to say whatever's on my mind. I rarely leave this website feeling upset or sad. Kinda a peaceful kind of happy rather than happy happy.",,,,,,,,,,

WARNING SN from IC traceable by the FBI,1976310,losing hope,"Apr 29, 2023 at 5:36 AM","I'm in the UK & ordered my IC SN a year ago. But around two weeks ago, I had the directors of the NHS service who looks after me & other suicidal people visited me to protect their own backs (& not my welfare). Basically it's all kicking off because of the recent reports like this & others...

Woman's death 'related to poisonous chemical', inquest hears
Kelly Walsh died in 2021
www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk

...& the full-day inquest within the UK which took take place on February 7, 2023 following all these UK SN suicides.

Because I have explicitly told that NHS service who looks after me I have this substance (which is not illegal to own) & that telephone call was recorded hence why they now would do anything to take it off my hands. Again not for my own protection, but to protect their own jobs. As a UK coroner would go after those directors if I was to suicide by this substance, given they now know & that call has been recorded.

Also during that visit those NHS directors, didn't offer me help, they just wanted to take the substance away from me. But they didn't want to take any knives or rope, which could also be used for suicide, away from me. Hence why I know they were just looking out for themselves. Funny how the NHS is chronically underfunded & understaffed when it comes to looking after the mentally ill. But as soon as an effective suicide agent appears, like this, the NHS directors are all over it like fly's over shit & no tax-payers funds are spared.

Perhaps you can see why I feel the NHS, threapists & 80% of the world being evil. As I'm just a tax revenue generator to these people. To be honest, I really don't know if I want to continue to live in this world if it is going this way?

To fight back against these evil people, I would waste their time & ensure they are held responsible for your suicide. Like I did by telling the NHS I have SN, so they come over but never ever giving it over to them as they have no powers. Money talks so by wasting their time, they will soon get fed up of losing & move on.

Would also recommend hiding your SN outside of where you live (maybe even spliting it so you can hide it in two places) just in case.",,,,,,,,,,

Ordered benzos & my other thoughts,2677354,uniqueusername4,"Sep 21, 2024 at 2:42 PM","I just ordered benzos for the sn method. I had to wait for my bitcoin to process, it took forever but I finally was able to follow the guide and access the markets needed to order. Now that I've done that, once it is here, I have my whole ctb kit ready. I just followed the guide on this site, it worked well.

I've had a lot of life changes recently and have been going back and forth about what I want. A lot of it is out of fear. The recent battle on sn via pro lifers on the site and reading about the concept of quantum immortality has done a number on me. I know logically that sn is a peaceful method for the most part and that there aren't long term side effects from an sn fail. I think constantly reading about these fake accounts where they feel every symptom possible to the max is not good though, even if I am aware they are fake. I'm just going to try not to think about quantum immortality as that is such a terrible fate. I think I need to a long break from this website for that reason. I think it could be making it harder to ctb reading about these ideas that prolifers keep sprinkling in here. It sucks because this place makes me feel better too or it used to. I think I will be more likely to ctb without it, thanks prolifers, y'all are doing exactly the opposite of what you want. Not to mention that creating this tension only makes ctb even more scarce and people are going to act on it while they can. So to all the freaks out there who think they are being a hero, you're not. You're harming a community that has already been excessively harmed and making us feel as if we have to ctb right away because people are taking our resources away.

I don't think that I am going to be able to make a decision about ctb or take action on it at the moment because I am quite literally high 24/7- weed- (I guess it wears off at some point when I am sleeping, but I am one of those wake and bake the whole day type people). I've obviously been using this as a coping mechanism to get through the days, but I feel like it makes me too unmotivated to do anything. I am not making progress in life or in death. I also think I haven't been sober for 6 years, maybe I should see what that is like. I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was younger and recently have learned so much about how ADHD and autism are on the same spectrum and they don't know where one begins and one ends. If I am autistic, it makes a lot more sense why it is so impossible for me to make and maintain connections. Not being able to blur the lines when people cross boundaries makes it pretty much impossible for me to feel safe as a suicidal human. But anyway, I think I have been using the weed to mask these things quite a bit too. Weed helps me appear more ""normal"". I've tried to quit in the past and it becomes really difficult not to impulsively ctb when I am not high. I am going to try my best to get sober and take a long break from this website (starting after my current stash runs out, hopefully less than a week) and try to get the clarity to make a decision. I will still be around on here for a few days at least if anyone wants to message me. I know that autistic people are more likely to commit suicide and I know that if this world wasn't so ableist, I probably wouldn't want to die. It kind of sucks having this knowledge because it makes it feel like it isn't my choice as much because I didn't design this world. I'm curious if other people are also not sober 24/7, does anyone else cope like that? and if so, how does it effect your ctb journey?

If I don't end up visiting the site again after deciding, and this is my last post, I am so grateful for its existence. It gave me a safe space to vent and allowed me to meet so many kind like minded humans. The mods are incredible, you guys handle so many issues, v mindful. I will always keep up the fight for the right to die, no matter what my choice ends up being.

Also, just something I've been pondering. As the world gets closer to impending climate change doom, wouldn't suicides be a positive thing for society? Obviously not for everyone but for the people who have a chronic physical/mental illness. I think I got this idea after visiting the church of euthanasia site. After reading that, I am confused as to why the hell our government gives af if we survive. They shouldn't be encouraging it necessarily but letting suicides naturally occur as they do without so much interference would decrease the world population?? helping climate change?? I think we're the only rational thinkers left.",,,,,,,,,,

Barely making ends meet while dealing with assholes and bad family sucks. They kept upping the dose and missing appointments which wasted my time until I stopped trying to see therapists.

Then I met someone and we hit it off great but later he became physically abusive. We were two peas in a pod and I had to leave for my safety. I'm mad at myself for not seeing early on that he was abusive. He was very nice at first. It's like he hid a different person from me. He had a rage he couldn't calm down and often tried to listen to my phone conversations.

I don't understand how someone can be so kind and great then turn into a raging monster who refuses to acknowledge what they do. It was scary. I had to call cops and leave in the night after secretly packing for days. Now I'm homeless and shelters are full.

I'm working on things but how can life go from bad to worse. I gave life and love a chance and it always lets me down in a spectacular fashion. I wish I CTB at 25. All my hopes and dreams meant nothing as everything has been taken or lost including my self respect and confidence in all humans.

A friend motivated me to leave fast with promises to help but has been absent now. I won't beg anyone for help as people love to have power over others in need. If you beg someone they'll turn up their nose or ignore you to make themselves feel high and mighty. I think things could work out but there's too much stacked against me including exhaustion with life.

No one has ever hit me so it's weird. Gaslighting is also a real thing. I'm glad it's over but I can't think of the last time I enjoyed being alive. Making plans and I have money to do things. That gives me hope. If I can leave everything will be good. No more struggle just silence and not existing. It's pretty great when you think about it.

Last fall I tried sleeping pills and alcohol and it didn't work. That's 2 attempts in less than a year. Something has to work. I wish someone could help me. It would probably be faster. I suck trying to CTB alone lol. I hope this time works..I don't know if it will ever get better.",,,,,,,,,,

Anyone else got PGAD and is now extremely suicidal? I can't keep up anymore,2676974,moonoverthesea,"Sep 21, 2024 at 6:27 AM","Hey.

I already had a plethora of health issues. Mainly
- gyno stuff: pcos. Few periods. Unbearable cramps. High testosterone. Ovarian cysts that explode and send me to the ER.
- GI stuff: diagnosed with SIBO/IBS, got told I'm ""a very, very, very bad case"" by my doctor. Nausea all day everyday, occasional unbearable cramps, burps, constipation.

Now, to make it all worse, out of the blue, I developed PGAD (please don't be weird about it, it's hell on earth). Basically, my genitals feel constantly, 24/7, as if I'm on the verge of coming. I repeat, it might seem funny but it's hell, it's painful and distracting. ""Taking care of it"" doesn't help at all, only and I'm back to square one after just a couple of seconds.

I can't do it anymore. I could already hardly live with the debilitating nausea from SIBO, I could hardly live with the terrible cramps from PCOS that would leave me squirming on the ground screaming from the pain, but at least there were are a few things that could help (though in 2 years of attempts still no progress). But I grew used to the nausea and cramps. This? This is absolutely unbearable. I feel like I'm going completely mad.

I was planning on hanging myself if things got too unbearable, but this... This makes everything impossible. Thinking is hard, planning is hard. I've found a nice bridge that's already been used successfully for suicide, so that'll probably be the way. I'm just angry that so much was taken from me, now the way I wanted to die has been taken too. I wish we could have a second chance at life.

I've learnt that when health goes awry with chronic conditions, it can only get worse. After the first chronic diagnosis (SIBO), everything got worse and worse and worse and diagnoses kept coming - PGAD is the most recent one and it is so rare that there is not even research on it. You're on your own, left unable to do anything but squirm in suffering.

Tl;Dr not really original here, but I want to die. If anyone would like to keep me a bit of company while I sort things out, or like... help me sort things things out before, not about the plan but like how to write letters to everyone that loves me and stuff, as I'm not good with writing.. or if someone else has PGAD (but I think it's too rare to happen)... either of those, that would really help a lot.

There is no reason to do any of the garbage they tell you must do . no one can now convince me that i have to do anything even live . or that i should want to do anything or that i have to believe anything at all.

for example society says life is a beautiful gift. i don't agree. also society seems to suggest that having children is good or nothing wrong with that . now to me i would never want to have children and never did. no one can convince me that i should or that i should think that is important. And now in some countries the birth rates are declining rapidly so some don't see that as objectively important either. but to me everything is meaningless and worthless . life is meaningless suffering.

Just when you learn to appreciate is when nature takes it away.
Wisdom is a cruel joke. Lessons to live a better life that is past, and does not apply as well to the future due to the ever-changing nature of the world and our circumstances.

At one point I did get pretty sharp and milked things nicely. But it was temporary. I'm glad I did but it doesn't help now. Pain is just more potent!
You could live a rich megastar kickass life for 99 years and it will be as dull and distant as what you had for breakfast last year today when in your 100th year your health finally fails and your loved ones are dead. Moment to moment.

Do not feel bad though, I think some of us humans have this biology...wired to be discontent to keep us chasing hard for survival purposes maybe. I also suspect this baseline discontent and pissy ungratefulness level is different from person to person genetically, though we can all practice gratitude a little bit. So, some will just feel better and not stress the small stuff easier. If that's not you, start by working on not beating yourself up over the past as much (easier said than done). The happy go lucky will have their misery too, and we will all die and it won't matter anyway--it'll be on to the next version of hell. Yay.",,,,,,,,,,

The 2 things stopping me from suiciding,2655626,esistzeit,"Sep 2, 2024 at 5:29 PM","1: Fear of the process of dying.
2 : Unable to let go of dreams.


1 - I'll be using sodium nitrite as my suicide method. Though I am familiar with the nausea caused by excessive salts, I'm still scared that it may be worse than what I'm expecting. I have always been super weak towards pain and discomfort, so it's no surprise here.
There are two ways to go about this. I could, A: intentionally and repeatedly cause nausea so that I grow used to the feeling and am no longer fazed by it; or B: think of way worse ways of dying, like being burned alive or being stabbed to death (this makes nausea & vomiting look like kid's play).
This is the easiest to overcome.


2 - There are innumerous things I didn't do that I wish I had; things that are forever lost and I'll never be able to have. The pain originated from this is the main cause of my suicidal urges. Because I cling to them so much, and because of this annoying little thing called ""hope"", I am unable to give up completely and just let go of everything.
I find it unacceptable that I came here just to feel pain. There's got to be something more other than this.
But how do I let go of things that are innate to me? People spend entire lifetimes trying to let go of their ""earthly desires"" and still fail. Sometimes it feels like it's just as hard to let go as it is to achieve them.
I think this is the biggest challenge. Allowing myself to die without having lived at all and being ""okay"" with it.
If I ever I figure this out maybe I'll be able to do it.",,,,,,,,,,

I have chronic nausea 24/7 because of a medical condition, and I just wanted to warn you that (in my case) you don't exactly grow used to it, so I'd really suggest not doing the ""getting it to get used to it"" thing. I had personally somewhat learnt to live with it when it's bearable, but when it's unbearable each time is worse than the previous one because the strength to get through it is less and less. And it won't make the suffering from the big nausea when the moment hits better, in my opinion. Sending hugs..",,,,,,,,,,

Life is worse since being discharged from Section,2662542,M3lancholia,"Sep 8, 2024 at 9:08 AM","I was sectioned for 28 days in June and finally discharged after 5 weeks of hospitalisation in the UK. I was starting to feel a bit of hope but all has crashed down around me now, 5 weeks after being discharged. I feel like I'm being punished for not wanting to be here and all the suicidal feelings are coming back. Life is so hard and I've lost the people who mean the most to me. I'm being judged by everyone and it's not positive. Only the professionals helping me now are telling me how good it is that I've come so far etc.
I had SN ready previously but that has now been taken from me.
I don't have the energy to fight anymore - everything keeps stacking against me & tomorrow I'll find out if I can go back to work. It'll be the final nail in the coffin if they say no as I love my job and obviously need it for financial reasons.
I don't feel 'crazy' or mentally ill - I just can't do life anymore. When I was in hospital I felt like they wanted to label me with some mental health disorder but couldn't. I rationally want to leave this life.
I'm in the middle of court proceedings (family law) that are making everything worse as I'm being judged by people who don't even know me.
I feel guilty for wanting to give up but really everyone would be better without me. I'm not an alcoholic/don't do drugs/never abused my children, yet apparently I'm too much of a risk to my children because of how I felt in June. Seeking help has made everything 1000 times worse and any hope has just been replaced with despair.
Has anyone else found that coming out of hospital after being sectioned has made everything worse?
I feel so alone as can't share my feelings for fear of being admitted again. Thank you to anyone who has bothered to read all this! Xx",,,,,,,,,,

I told them in a first message that I wanted CTB by jumping... but it was drowned out in the middle of a long message where I said my adoration for Philip Nitschke.

They told me not to kill me to check with my doctor

I sent back a message saying that I was not treatable. I begged them with a lot of crying smiles to have a little note, even a line from Philip Nitschke or an autographed photo...
I have a Twitter fanclub of him too and bought a t shirt fan of him...

They replied in one line that he could do nothing for me.

2.3 days later I see the reimbursement of my subscription + the reimbursement of my donation. at the same time being a subscriber was of absolutely no use to me as already a method and place but to give money to Philip Nitschke.

With borderline personality disorder I often have huge fixations on a person...

They must have been afraid of me and didn't want to be bothered by me. at the same time given all the money that the company didn't break the bank to reimburse me.

In your opinion, why did they even reimburse the donation? I found it nice that they reimbursed me without asking...

I'll only offer the advice to not bother with Google, DMC doesn't appear in Google results even with the complete name of the site.

After trying to find it ever since his original store was shut down (which I also found, but didn't order from while it was up), I finally found it a few days ago. After pondering for a few days, I decided to actually go ahead and make an order for 100g of SN (both because I am a larger person & because I want more than one chance at it).

It costed a lot more than I would have liked to pay, but its a price I was willing to pay for the relief of knowing I will actually have a way out if I come to the decision I want to take it. I am unlikely to use it as soon as I get it, I just want to know I have it in case things get too much for me. With fees and shipping, it cost me ~$120 Canadian to have it shipped to a PO box in Ontario. I didn't bother with paying extra for the express shipping since I won't be using it right away anyway.

Much to my surprise, my anxiety levels were not at the record high I expected when actually going through the ordering process. I was more concerned about screwing up Paysend than anything else (I used the ""to a bank account"" option, as the Mastercard/Visa options required information like his postal code which was not given).

I am a bit scared that customs might intercept my package and I'll get welfare checked, or worse get in trouble for smuggling (although I'd plead ignorance in either case). I do also have concerns around there being any other errors in the order process causing me to lose out on my order and the money I spent on it, but I'm far more worried about being caught.

I imagine that when I actually go pick up the package from the post office in a few weeks will be more anxiety provoking (although I do have a story made up in case the post office employee is chatty and curious about why I have a package from Ukraine). I am definitely worried about how I will bring the package home without any questions being asked by my family, although I've intentionally been more secretive about my packages' contents for some time now, so that I can keep any package's contents secret for any reason, not just ctb related things).

,2656936,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 3, 2024 at 8:37 PM","Congrats! It was a hefty price for me as well, and I paid for expedited shipping since I have no clue if I'll need to use it soon or not, so that was even more money. But I agree that it's worth it to have that peace of mind.
Being in Canada, that is probably a concern (at least from what I've seen), but hopefully someone with experience ordering from DMC in Canada can chime in and give you an actual answer. But the UK seems to be the worst offender for welfare checks so at least you've got that going for you, could be worse.

I'm not sure about customs though. But DMC is really good about shipping things properly and efficiently from what I've seen, so I don't believe you'll have any errors during the process.
Fortunately, DMC ships it discreetly, so they won't be able to tell what it is nor will those who reside in your home. And I can't imagine a package from Ukraine is suspicious. What would they even think it is? Definitely not SN, as that's pretty much hidden knowledge found only on this forum and that will quite literally be the last thing on their mind.

True. But would the post office worker know that? That's what I was getting at. As for those in your household, that will probably be more tricky given what you've said.

Planning on taking mine sometime this winter most likely, probably after New Years or even potentially February. If I get cold feet I may just hold on to SN for longer since my parents are aging anyways and almost in their 70's as SN lasts quite a long time.

Worst case scenario it's nice knowing that there is always an ""out"" if your life spirals out of control, you develop a terminal illness, or your freedom is in jeopardy. Honestly though, I've been done with this existence for a solid year and things aren't going to get better, I also have heart issues and my body has begun retaining fluid due to them so in all honesty I doubt I'll make it past 40 (I'm 35 in a month by the way) and if I do make it to 40 I'll likely wish I was CTB anyways as my health will have further deteriorated.

The moment I receive my SN I'm going to celebrate and possibly even purchase a bottle of wine despite not being a big drinker these days by any means. I do know that if I had SN at the time I would have taken it for certain a few months ago when the most traumatic experience of my life happened.

Right now my life is pretty much in a limbo and it's likely going to stay like that for the foreseeable future. I have no obligations that make my life either pleasurable or painful in any way and everything is 5/10 across the board but that may be because I'm emotionally numb these days so it's difficult to even recognize when I should smile or frown anymore.

Was visiting my parents earlier today (who know I've been through severe emotional trauma) and now that I think about it I don't believe I showed any visible emotions whatsoever. My mom cries every time I leave because she knows I'm just a shell at this point and I'm beginning to wonder if they'd be either sad or relieved when I pass. I know that it's easy to assume they'd be sad but they know firsthand what I experienced so I highly doubt they would even be surprised in the slightest if I were to CTB and maybe then they could actually focus on themselves instead of supporting me because I'm a burden on them as my memory is beyond horrible (thankfully, in all honesty) so they have to help me pay bills and remind me of appointments or events.

I used to have no issue with these things but now they are an insurmountable challenge to navigate for me. Yeah, I can set alarms for every single thing but I don't always remember to charge my phone and I'm not on the computer all the time so I can't rely on that either.",2656893,,,,,,,,,

,2662384,lawlietsph,"Sep 8, 2024 at 5:23 AM","Hey guys, I just need someone to listen because I'm so alone.
So I am a 28 yrs old female, and I still live with my mother.
I am struggling with finding work since the age of 20. I've got accepted to college, but never went because I couldn't get out of bed, I just wanted to die. Ever since then I am struggling.
Somehow I managed to build an online store from scratch, but that is ended up failing too. I've had no idea what I was doing. A year ago I managed to find a part time job in online marketing, but I hate my ""boss"" with a passion and the money is barely enough, it is basically enough to pay my debt in tiny parts. I have $700 healthcare debt which maybe doesn't seem too much, but the country I live in it is too much. In august I made $80 with the part-time job... So basically I have no idea how to stay alive at this point, I can't buy proper food or anything anymore.
All I do is looking for remote jobs, but there's barely any. I keep applying without any success.
This is another thing, I simply cannot work in a regular 9-5. I am 100% sure I have undiagnosed autism -light, smells, talking, noises and people in general are just too much for me. I live in a small village, 1 hour away from the nearest city. It means I would have to travel 2 hours a day on top of the 8 hours work, and I am just completely unable to do it. I don't know how to explain this, but my body and my brain is just shutting down. I've tried it in the past, but after working for a week in a supermarket I was just dead. Mentally dead, suicidal, aggressive, just completely dead. I have no idea what to do anymore.
In this country home office is not such a popular thing, only for really smart people. I am not smart, most of the job titles I can't even understand, because it is written in english. My english is not so good as you can see, I'm not good in anything really. All I do is try, try, try, try, but nothing ever gets better. My family is toxic. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for being able to live with my mother and stuff, but she is sooooo toxic too, I can't even explain. She used to beat the shit out of me and my sister, and other times she was giving us the silent treatment - not talking to us for weeks. I was just a child, I needed my mom and she refused to talk to me. My father is a narcissist, he lives around but barely cares about me. My sister is successful in her job and all, she has BPD and tend to be extremely narcissistic as well.
I have a lot of trauma from childhood, I can barely stay alive and go on with the days. All I want to do is die.
And I can't help but feel like death is the only option left for me. I would rather hang myself than to go work for someone else, just so I can buy basic needs and not starve to death.
I don't know, I would be happy with anything at this point, I don't have such big dreams, I just want to move out and be alone.
It all seems like something I could never reach. The more I try and the more cv-s I send, the more I realize that I simply don't have a place in this world.
There's not a single soul who cares. I've never had friends or anything. Nobody cares and the world would be so much better without me. I know I am just a pain in the ass for my mother too. After all, she has to pay for my food and other stuff too.
I feel extremely guilty, but I just cannot function in society... I could go and work in a factory for a little bit more money, but it would cost me everything. I would die from being overstimulated. I have no idea what to do anymore. And I try and try so hard, but it just never gets better. Soon I'll be 30, I don't even want to think about that. I am so fucking alone.",,,,,,,,,,

I too have Aspergers so I also have the light, noise etc. problems, we currently have another and hopefully last heatwave where I live and right now it´s so bright outside and it makes me overstimulated so it´s hard to just sit and chill at the PC, like I can´t watch dark videos or play games because of the stupid sun it´s also boiling despite I am sitting in front of a fan, can´t wait till the Autumn weather finally arrives.

It really seems like you have tried a lot more than most, I certainly never had a business but it must also be a defeat when losing it, and I understand where you are coming from about work, I also tried working in a supermarket last year for 4 weeks and it was only 2 hours 2 times a week but like you I get easily overstimulated which I am getting better at noticing so when my nervous system get overstimulated I have to take a break even from things I want to do e.g. gaming because my body just need to sit and rest and it sucks it feels like I am 80 years old I shouldn´t feel like this at my age everyone else my age has the energy of their age but I don´t I get easily overstimulated and it sucks.

And I am sorry to hear about you don´t have any friends or never had that is horrible life is so much better with friends although I don´t have any anymore but I know how great it was to have. And also horrible you have such a bad relationship with family it makes me sad when I read from people on this forum that there are people here many people in fact that has no one who cares about them no family or friends everyone should have someone who cares unfortunately life isn´t fair.

,2662431,lawlietsph,"Sep 8, 2024 at 7:14 AM","Well, I am trying to think. I am kinda okay with copywriting, making stuff in Canva, and just overall administrative jobs. Something that doesn't require decision making, talking to others and HUUUGE responsibility. But I can't find one like this, at least not in my country.

But my true passion is animals, horses, psichologycal things. I thought about working around horses, but physically I'm not strong enough to carry all the heavy stuff.
Yes I can understand you. To be honest I didn't know for the longest time what the hell is wrong with me. I never understood why noises are hurting me physically, or why do I hate to be touched even just a tiny bit, etc... It really sucks, because you just feel constantly tired and taking the bus is such a huge task, almost like climbing a huge mountain. I mean how can you even function like this?
Sometimes I think about if I were to live in a city and maybe I could go to work by a 10 minute walk or something, it would be somewhat easier. I don't know... I just don't want to communicate, I hate to talk and I hate to forcing myself to look the other person in the eye. It is tiring.

Something I forgot to mention in the original post is that recently (well 2 months ago) I was diagnosed with Lyme disease. Now I live with constant muscle and joint pains and an overall awful feeling in my body.
Life is not fair. I would do anything to have some kind of emotional support, but here I am. Completely alone. :(",2662401,2662421,,,,,,,,
,2662983,TheGoodGuy,"Sep 8, 2024 at 3:37 PM","Yeah I guess that is why we are exhausted more than other people because it takes a lot of energy to be extra aware and weakened by sensory input. But something that has worked for me was getting exposed to certain things we don´t like and be prepared to face it, like you I had a hard time navigating public transportation like busses and trains but now I have learned to get around where I need where I live and tomorrow I will take another bus a new one which I am not sure exactly where is located since the site didn´t state it but I have an idea so I am a bit nervous but I have had some wins learning how to use the busses where I live so it have given me some confidence when it comes to taking public transportation but I still get nervous and extra aware when I am in a new bus to a new destination and afraid it was the wrong one but so far it has mostly gone good.

I live in a bigger city now I used to live in a small town so it´s nice everything is close and the exposure for more people and vehichles has also made it easier to tolerate those things when going back to smaller towns then it seems like there is almost nothing.

That is horrible you got that decease is there anything the doctors can do about it with medicine I know nothing about that decease but despite that I just thought I would mention since another member recently mentioned it to me with my severe allergy problems that maybe the carnivore or lion diet would help which Mikhaila Peterson talks a lot about on her YouTube channel it has helped her mom with lyme decease if I remember correctly I can´t remember by how much I am currently trying to ease into it and give life another big try, not trying to preach to you btw just thought I would throw it out there since I just got told about it.

I also forgot to mention before I am 30 years old so close to you yet feels like an eternity from being in my 20´s at 29 to 30 I hate it so much so I understand why you dread it so did I as the years crept closer to the 30 and it´s hard to accept that I wasted my 20´s being sick in both my body and mind, it´s the time everyone makes there great memories for life thinking back on partying, traveling making new friends and living life but I have been sick throughout my 20´s so I missed out on that.",2662431,,,,,,,,,
,2663194,LapseInTime,"Sep 8, 2024 at 7:13 PM","Absolutely. I can barely get out of bed, make it from my room to the kitchen and back. I always lack the emotional strength, the physical one too. Age is just a number, I feel like I am 70 years old, I cannot do it. I cannot even imagine myself being around other people. I too can understand that I'm weird, off, depressed and clumsy in hiding it. I realize that I don't actually want to work; I want a way to stop being a burden, perhaps something to get my mind away from suffering. The routine is scary. The people are scary. The fact that I would have to do it every day is scary. If I don't, I'll get yelled at - rightfully so, but I cannot have that, there is only so much I can handle. I wish I could go back to being young; at least then I didn't have feel ashamed about not doing anything. A sick child is to be tended to. A sick adult is a leech, a burden, God knows.

I'm a bum, I hate the idea of work, I hate the people, I hate myself, I hate everything but the fact that it may make you feel independent. But at what cost? Taking all of that into consideration, the chances of me performing actually exist; they are right next to none.

Besides, even ""normal"" people hate it. Isn't it natural for somebody who's been sick to not be able to do it? It's only reasonable...",,,,,,,,,,

"Sam Vaknin is against voluntary death, why?",2677143,paredler,"Sep 21, 2024 at 10:37 AM","Sam Vaknin is a psychologist who wrote and makes videos about narcisissm and the human psychology in general. When talking about human socety and economy, Vaknin admits that poverty is the state of most people and people will be forever poor with no signs of improvement neither in the near future nor in the far future. Vaknin claims that our idea of upward mobility and our yearning for living better than our parents is some modern western belief that is influenced from our ""self made man"" culture and has no grounds in the real world.

Despite all that, Vaknin is against voluntary death. He claims that when you're dead you have no potential of growth, but when you're alive, you have some little potential. This is bullshit. Even if you do have potential by being alive, poverty will kill it and will leave you no choice but living in pain and suffering with no opportunity of improvement. Actually, social death is worse than physical death because social death is painful while physical death is, at least supposed to be, painless.",,,,,,,,,,

I think he's against it for the same reason as the majority of society - they're simply pro-life/anti-choice, and likely haven't fully and meaningfully considered the other side of the matter, or even examined their own side. This is evidenced by his cognitive dissonance. He knows poor folks overwhelmingly remain that way for the rest of their lives, and recognizes the bullshit ""self made"" sentiment held by society at large, yet his argument against voluntary death is contradicts this position. I think it's clear he hasn't thought about it enough to be logically consistent/homogeneous.",,,,,,,,,,

Rather they both came and sat on my bed, I'll never forget how one of them actually walked up to me, & tapped me 2 times & let out a quiet, squeaky, broken meow. It was like I knew he was asking me if I was okay. He also knew I wasn't and layed down right next to me. I did of course get up to feed them, but they immediately returned to the bed after eating. I could feel they were concerned. It was one of the only times I've felt cared for in the past few years.

I don't think my family likes me. I believe the see me as a sick person who they don't want to disturb.

Transgender Support Megathread,1968568,ArchmagePrincess,"Apr 23, 2023 at 7:52 PM","I don't think it's pathetic to be incredibly scared of openly being yourself. It's an incredibly difficult thing to do. You can lose friends and family, and get discriminated against and harassed for being openly trans. It's horrendous so many people see us as freaks just for wanting to be ourselves, and that pain is immense and never truly goes away.

As a trans person who has been out and transitioned for years now, I can say my experience has been a mixed bag. I've had some people be incredibly kind and accepting right off the bat and make me feel loved for who I was, and I've lost many people I thought would be with me for a long time and faced a lot of people's bullshit. Co-workers, family, and friends have been on either side of that. I don't regret transitioning or coming out one bit, but it has been hard. It's taken forever, but I can finally look at myself in the mirror and think I'm cute, something teenaged me would've never have thought possible.

Being openly trans demands a lot of strength from a person, who is already hurting and scared, and it's incredibly unfair. I still remember being a little kid just dreaming of becoming a princess and wanting to wear dresses and be seen as a sister and a daughter, and so so much pain has come from such an innocent wish.

I hope you are able to summon the strength to be yourself even if it's only right before your death.

Transgender Support Megathread,1968681,Unending,"Apr 23, 2023 at 10:04 PM","I've kind of just going about life as if I'm not even trans for quite some time, sort of trying to blend in as a cis person but it really sucks and is very depressing/upsetting. I started hrt before I turned 20 and got a minor surgery last year but still feel like a man. I mean, I guess it's probably because I still get called sir and him every time someone in public addresses me so obviously strangers don't think I look like a woman. I really would prefer if I pass because I already have an anxiety disorder/ptsd which makes being around people hard initially and this issue of not passing makes me feel unsafe or like an easy target in public.

Even though I've been transitioning for years, I still get the idea that I don't register to others as a trans woman or a cis woman, but some weird, awkward, feminine, scarred-armed gay guy.

I fucking hate it like you wouldn't believe how people just trivialize the suffering of it as well. I know it's hard for people to conceptualize why it is so painful and depressing to feel like you're stuck in the wrong body but there's no need to talk like I'm some ""snow-flake"" or whatever stupid term like that.

Though at the same time I'm afraid of transition because I know I'll never pass, everytime I look in the mirror I realize no matter how much I try I'll just end up looking half done. What can I do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I have to come to terms with the fact I'll die like this. I have no friends, my parents hate queer people, I have nowhere to run to. This world hates people like me, if people found out what would they do?

between all of these things I guess it's just best to realize the fact that I'll die like this. Nobody will remember me as who I am, nobody will know me, nobody would even bother to find out more.

I just cannot picture myself being truly happy unless that I got a lobotomy, and even then whether I am actually happy or not would be debatable.

Although I know that I'll be dying soon, I am glad that I somehow survived my first retirement attempt (pre-HRT) and made it this far. I'm still going to be dead, but at least I can die as myself and look presentable while doing so. I do have to admit that I feel somewhat guilty about wanting to die given that my situation, while not ideal, is much better than what the majority of other trans people have to deal with. To think that the miracle solution to nearly all my problems was contained within a tiny green pill just a prescription away…",,,,,,,,,,

I got antiemetics, antacid, paracetamol, and also diuretic and laxative. Laxative and diuretic are here so I won't be covered in body fluids when I'm done. Even if something remains, I'm gonna lay 2 towels under myself before drinking SN. I also got trash can, plastic cups for SN, and mint for covering taste. I also managed to crack window open, and smell won't stay in room.
I wanna make everything as smooth as I can. I'm gonna write a will in this saturday, and if everything is alright, I'll ctb next week. So, before that, I wanna share what I wanna do.
I also remember about order of antiemetics, antacid and paracetamol from SN bible, just won't write them here. But I'll follow this order, too. So:
I'll eat tiramisu cake before fasting and using laxative, so around 48 hours before SN. I just really love tiramisu, can't just leave without having a bite.
I'll use laxative and diuretic in 24 hour before SN to clear system as much as possible.
I wanna do makeup before ctb, too. I live with a roommate, and even though she will be frightened in any way, I wanna do at least something to make it easier to cope. So I'll do makeup and cover any open skin with concealer.
Then mix SN with water in 3 cups, lay towels on bed, put trash can near.
I'll chat with my best friend a bit. I also already gave him list of numbers to check if I had successfully ctb, as here are city morgue, classmates, family.
Say goodbye, log out of of SS, clear browser history, then put some lo-fi stream on.
I'll drink first cup, and eat mint. Then second if it's not enough or I vomit. Lay down and that's it, passing out to calm music.

I also wanna to prepare myself for bad taste of SN, maybe drinking something sour or/and bitter. Only thing I can think of is tonic, since I cannot have alcohol. Any tips about that? I'll be glad to any suggestions.",,,,,,,,,,

Visine for suicide,2667576,ihateearth,"Sep 12, 2024 at 2:08 PM","Visine can be deadly. Why hasn't it been used for suicides? Someone here claimed they drank 10 bottles and had no effect, but that sounds like a false flag. Tetrahydrozoline is the ingredient in nasal sprays and eyedrops that becomes poisonous when orally ingested. Half a bottle can seriously harm a small child as told by a mother who had to take her unresponsive kid to an ER.

Cases exist of people dying from having drops placed in their water bottle by murderous friends or by an angry wife. It's available anywhere and cheap. With higher volume, I wonder if this is a good method to CTB.

Visine Exit
Add X bottles of visine to beverages based on your weight and height. I read that 45 bottles are needed for a 150lb person, but that needs to be verified or calculated. Math isn't my strength so don't quote me.
A bottle of Visine is .5 ounces. The active ingredient in Visine is Tetrahydrozoline hydrochloride and is 0.05% or 0.5 MG/ML per bottle. So a calculation is needed to dose properly.
Consider a multi-drug approach as a failsafe. Sleeping pills and alcohol plus other forms of medication that further depress the central nervous system and respiratory system
Wouldn't this be painless as the body becomes unconsciousness? How could things go wrong? How to avoid potential vomiting if one is unconscious?

Where to do it
Deep woods or back country away from a city at night when traffic is absent. Hide well to not be easily found and take a backpack or small bag with supplies. Learn stealth camping techniques to blend in if hiding is important
Inside of your car and park somewhere remote or where you won't be disturbed for hours. Either way get rid of your phone before the final destination and throw keys far away from the car if serious
If a search party is called, how long would people search before calling it off?

I couldn't find med papers about Visine and suicide, but it kills and is apparently tasteless. Why is SN so popular when we have things like Visine? I wonder how much 45 bottles cost. They could be stockpiled over time. I think this is a peaceful and painless method. SN, hanging, guns, and more can be complicated or hard to source.",,,,,,,,,,

Right, sleeping pills have been made safer, and they've done that to anti-freeze, too, although I think that was ""mostly"" because pets were frequently drinking it and dying.

On one hand you have multiple stories of people killing their spouses with mere ""drops"" of the stuff, and then you see stories, some of them here on SaSu, and even in the one I linked, where people drink bottles of the stuff and still survive.

I'll tell AI the bottle size and amount of a random ingredient plus my body size to make it spit out the answer. I don't know how much longer I can stay alive, but at least I have a soft way out.

The way people die when murdered by Visine sounds peaceful. It can look like a suicide unless an autopsy finds the chemical in their body. This woman only got caught because she had a criminal record for forgery and identity theft that made her a suspect. Otherwise the woman's death would've been ruled an overdose.

Can anyone with medical/pharmacological knowledge answer my question?,2676670,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 20, 2024 at 8:10 PM","I've got my SN and I'm just waiting on my Metoclopramide to arrive. But ever since I made the Meto order, I've started to become concerned about the potential adverse effects of it, and whether they'd fuck up my SN plan. Especially since I'll be actively mixing the SN drinks while the Meto takes effect, and I'm worried some sort of nasty condition will hit me like Tardive Dyskinesia or another extrapyramidal symptom that prevents me from executing my protocol.

So I've been reading through some medical info online, posts here on the forum, and threads on other sites, and it appears that Diphenhydramine is used to effectively treat and possibly prevent these symptoms/effects (it's apparently used in hospitals for such conditions). So I'm wondering if anyone here that has any medical or pharmacological experience can confirm this.

Would taking 50mg of DPH about an hour prior to Meto ingestion prevent any potential extrapyramidal effects?

Can anyone with medical/pharmacological knowledge answer my question?,2676682,schrei_nach_liebe,"Sep 20, 2024 at 8:33 PM","I'm not too familiar with combatting TD, if I have I've usually administered something like benztropine (I don't think anyone would be able to get their hands on that without a really good reason). I'm having a little trouble figuring out why DPH would be effective with that, but I don't really see any issue with taking a tiny amount like that if it makes you more comfortable. Also, I've given truckloads of AE drugs and I've taken truckloads myself, I've never ever seen TD occur. I have seen TD with certain antipsychotics. The most profound thing I've seen is specifically with ondansetron and a prolonged QT interval while on a monitor. All my patients at my last job were on a monitor of some type at all times as I was in critical care. Usually with the QT interval, it never resulted in anything other than what we saw on the monitor and it was usually short-lived and usually only when someone didn't follow the protocol for how slowly we are supposed to push the drug (IV). I've heard a lot that many times when someone says they are having TD they are someone who knows exactly what TD is and that it may occur with one of their drugs, and rather magically the people who have no idea what it is never seem to notice anything or display any signs of it. A lot of things are in peoples' heads sometimes, whether intentional or not. I can't even count the number of people who thought they'd had strokes and not a single thing was wrong with them yet their face was drooping, yet when they fell asleep it wasn't drooping anymore.

Can anyone with medical/pharmacological knowledge answer my question?,2676720,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 20, 2024 at 9:21 PM","Apparently it has something to do with the anticholinergic effect of DPH. It can help with ""parkinsonian effects"" and tremors, which would be classed as extrapyramidal afaik.

I don't have the link anymore (can't find it now), but I read in a medical report that a person checked into the emergency room with extrapyramidal symptoms, and they administered an 50mg IV dose of DPH and then 25mg orally after 4 hours, and then they left the hospital shortly after with no more symptoms. And I read anecdotal reports of individuals taking DPH at home for TD caused by schizophrenia meds, and they apparently had success with that.
Oh I am aware that these potential adverse effects are pretty rare. but still, I've never taken Meto before (I've only ever had Ondansetron at the hospital, which didn't help with vomiting at all LOL) and it is a bit of a risk given its rather infamous reputation. Though as you say, it could be hyped up by lawyers and companies as a sort of CYA, but there's a lot of people who swear off this drug entirely due to how strongly it affected them. But there's also people who've taken it for 10 years straight with no issues, so there's also that.

I would do a test dose of maybe 20mg, just to see how it affects me. But if it were to adversely affect me, I'm not sure if it'd be so bad that I need to get checked out by a doctor, and I don't know how I'd explain it away to them considering I don't have a prescription for the medication.

Yeah, AEs don't tend to be terribly effective and I think they're ordered more than they should be. Yes, vomiting too often isn't great, but in the setting of the ICU if we're concerned about that we're giving you potassium and managing your hydration and pH, or other methods based on what the root cause is thought to be. Vomiting exists for a reason and in many scenarios we actively avoid preventing it. Meto and domperidone are most useful in my experience with gastroparesis or other decreased gut motility, however domperidone is not available or certified for use in the US because it's excreted in breast milk and probably other reasons.",,,,,,,,,,

I could not keep a meal down and I was just dry heaving and puking out bile.

And this also lines up with the intended role for AEs with SN, as we aren't really trying to stop the nausea and vomiting (though that would be nice), but rather we're trying to speed up gastric emptying so the SN can be absorbed quicker. It's good to hear that it's effective for this purpose in your experience, though we already knew that it was pretty good for that. Still, it's nice to have an additional supporting anecdote.
This is why I went with Meto instead of Dom. I'd've preferred Dom, since it doesn't penetrate the blood-brain barrier and cause extrapyramidal symptoms (while still being equally as effective for gastric emptying as Meto). But it's not an approved drug here in the US, so if I wanted to sneak an AE through customs it'd have to be Meto.

Full disclaimer- I have zero medical knowledge, only personal experience & a little bit from here.
So this may or may not be of use but at a minimum, might act as a bump…
If you're on any other meds, at all, put all of that into a good drug interaction checker - it's why I can't get / won't use meto as my AE, even though it's the first or best choice for most people. The interaction checker explicitly mentions TD as a major response / high probability for meto & my meds but not a mention of it at all with prochlorperazine which is how I had it legitimately prescribed in the past. Apologies if the interaction checker was already covered, my vision problems are a lot worse than usual today & I'm having a struggle reading. I also did a trial of just 1 tablet of my AE, to help overcome the fear - I think leaning towards stat dose might be better in that case. And zero side effects, even though I was both actively looking for them but also aware that my brain might imagine some as per above. I really thought SOMETHING would hapoen, real or imagined, but for me, nothing. And I can get ridiculous side effects even from OTC painkiller etc. But if you're only trialling it out & get sick & have to see a doctor, they may not need evidence of prescription if it's not your regular doctor. And there's always the fib - ""I usually have such bad side effects from meds but can take exactly what my brother / sister / mother does, & I know I really shouldn't have but I took one of theirs because I couldn't stop vomiting & was scared….""

So I needed to know what was both likely to be legitimately prescribed & also be one endorsed by the PPH. If I hadn't done my research & was refused meto, the doctor could've prescribed any old AE & then if I found out not helpful with SN, I would've had to have waited, gone back to doc & paid again (big issue for me, money), said I had side effects from what they prescribed & go through the whole thing again.

I hope that's the case.
this is what I remember reading - that the higher the dose the higher the risk. and with the SN protocol, it's a decent sized dose but nothing too high or anything.

I suppose my worries are unfounded. But the stories of a person getting TD from just a single dose were concerning. and of course the general reputation the drug has among patients and doctors certainly doesn't help.",2677037,2677047,,,,,,,,

I think it can become an unfortunate case of placebo though. Worrying about it so much that you take it and suddenly become hyper aware of everything your body feels and starting to think you may be developing it. I actually stopped looking at side effects before taking meds because I know I get myself wrapped up in that and all of a sudden I'm developing Steven's Johnsons syndrome from a little red spot on my skin. It can happen after one dose, don't get me wrong, but it isn't super common. It definitely isn't the drug of choice for many, and the risk of that is a big part of what played into the downfall of its use. I think if you're worried about it then taking benadryl can help with the psychological aspect.",2677069,,,,,,,,,

Logistically, this is pretty impossible unless she got caught in a current or had some pretty heavy boulders in her coat.

What gets me tho is the pain involved. Drowning doesn't seem like fun and sadly that was probably her last resort.

I don't get jealous over people suffering in death tho. Her death must have been long and drawn out.

Even guns deaths are gruesome and surely hurt.

I recently began researching death with dignity laws in Switzerland and can go estly way that's the way to go. They use a barbiturate and have a doctor assist. It's the most painless death you can have. The barbiturate puts you into a doma and then your respiratory system stops.

Sadly, I don't think I would qualify based on mental illness nor chronic pain, and the cost is around 12000 francs.

If Ohio ever adopted a law it would make people happy.

My own life is so full of failure and stupidity I honestly can say death is the only way out of my problems as well, but alas, I don't see it happening.

No matter how hard I try, I cannot CTB either, mostly because I don't have any methods.

Firearms aren't happening and I cannot hang myself knowing how long and drawn out that can be.

Inert gases seemed to be the way to go but when I tried argon I didn't go unconscious. That attempt was the closest I got to CTB but sadly failed.",,,,,,,,,,

Okay hello personal life update,2677028,sillyprincessmeow,"Sep 21, 2024 at 8:05 AM","Well, I've been gone for about a year, things haven't been so bright though. I broke up with Apple again and March of this year, I just finally take it and I found a new boyfriend, I'm gonna call him, Jay, however, before that, during that time, I was pretty much sober, except for smoking every now and then, like smoking weed, And I felt pretty good, besides all of the other things that were happening, I felt happy, especially towards the end of the year when I started talking to Jay. Anyway, when I started dating Jay, it was pretty good, but he would tell me things like ""oh I don't know if I'm ready for a relationship"" and stuff like that, but it doesn't matter too much because I can understand why he was scared, But we were also smoking like a lot of weed, like it went to the point where we went through a whole zip in a week. We were smoking like four blunts or so, and it was really bad, we we're getting really high and stuff, and once summer night before I left to go back to my home state for a visit, he had choked me and made me pass out and he was really high, and I was like tapping him to get him to stop, but this isn't to say that he hurts me or anything. Low-key I was into that, like I just feel the need to be taken control of, like I just feel the need to be hurt and abused and then to be cared for like moments later, which is really weird, but you know whatever, so I wasn't really mad about him for that, I was just a little uncomfortable as anyone would be because it's just like damn , like he literally just choke me to death, which is kind of scary, but it doesn't really matter. But then he also cheated on me, twice, and it really hurt me because he told me that he wouldn't do that stuff, like I don't understand why he needs to look at other girls when he has me, but you know me and him already talked about this. I guess, it's just a little frustrating, and it makes me feel disgusted, it makes me feel very insecure. And my emotions towards him have changed a little bit, I just don't feel very connected with him as much as I should and it's a little frustrating to say the least. I feel like I'm not good enough now, and it's gonna take a lot for him to make me feel better, but when he does, he does make me feel very good.
To talk about another thing, I feel like I was the problem in my last relationship, like I feel like it was my fault. I feel like it was my fault that you was treating me that way because I was reading all text messages and it appears that he would just say oh ""I just want some alone time"" but at the same time it's like he would be letting me down because we would make a compromise so that we were both happy, And then he wouldn't follow through with it, he would not follow through with any of the compromises. And I would like cuss him out, and say ""I fucking hate you so fucking much, you're a fucking piece of shit, I fucking hate you"" and then as soon as he would tell me that he's gonna break up with me I would be like ""I'm so sorry. Please don't leave me, I'll be better for you, I'm so sorry that I was like that, I'm really really sorry"" And then he wouldn't break up with me, but he would say ""the next time you do this I'm breaking up with you"" and he never would, so it's like I don't know if he was just doing that because he knows that it gets a reaction out of me and stuff or what. it really just seems like relationship died within the first year, and I was trying to revive something that wasn't there. I don't think I really loved him, I think I might've just loved having someone around. But then it's not like I did, I just felt so alone, and he was really disrespectful anyway.
But for the most part, I really think I wanna make it work with Jay, I see a lot in him, and I really love him, and I think I'll be able to love him more and be happy and stuff.",,,,,,,,,,

Grief is unfixable,2676587,PuppyCatTeeth,"Sep 20, 2024 at 6:22 PM","I'm 19 and have struggled with depression, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts. Things got even worse after my grandma passed away from cancer. Just a month later, my mom was diagnosed with cancer and only lived for a few more months. The loss of my mom has been the hardest. No amount of therapy or medication can help me

I was part of a partial hospitalization program for a few weeks, but it only made me feel worse. People there would complain about things like their mom making them do chores, while mine was dead.

Since my mom died, my dad has become abusive. Today, without any warning, he brought his new girlfriend over. I have a boyfriend, but he doesn't seem to understand what I'm going through. I feel like I can't genuinely connect with anyone; I always feel like an alien just watching everyone else.

It's not that I don't have friends, or that I'm not in a relationship, or that Im ugly. Before my mom died, I had everything I thought I wanted, yet I still wanted to die. Now, I feel like I've seen everything life has to offer, and I'm done.

The only thing keeping me here is my little sister. I love my boyfriend, but lately, I've just felt annoyed by him and don't even feel like talking. Therapists tell me things I already know, and it feels like a waste of time. I feel like I've tried everything.",,,,,,,,,,

My VSED experiences (Pretty detailed-ish),2676517,Chili,"Sep 20, 2024 at 4:51 PM","I'm sharing my experiences with VSED since I had attempted it in the past and never shared how it went. No idea what you'd get from this. Obviously, it did not work and was much more trouble than it was worth. It had always been a goal of mine to die from starvation, but it was never practical.

I've had an eating disorder since I was in high school, and it has continued after college. At the time I was attempting to die from starvation, I started low-calorie Mondays through Fridays and fasted on weekends until my BMI was low enough. I took a week off of work, skipped all my classes, dedicated myself to not eating that week, tossed all food in my house in the donate bin or the trash, and locked myself in my home for seven days. I just watched YouTube. I wrote and read some pretty delirious poems (I don't even like poetry). I made some purchases I regret now. It honestly felt like that week passed by quickly. I drank water and green tea during this week.

And I survived. I felt like shit, though. I had taken the week off and had to work double the hours I had done prior weeks to give other workers a break in a pretty labor-intensive job. So, I went to work and did probably the worst job I've ever done. It was pretty obvious something was off, so no one said a word to me. Halfway into that next week, I drop and have a heart attack. I get whisked off in an ambulance. Apparently, not eating can cause heart arrhythmias, and it was downhill from there. It's pretty easy to tell someone hasn't eaten in a week when they're at the hospital.

I tried again as soon as I was not under watch with alcohol and weed, same year. I gave up straight up starving because it was only making things worse. I honestly can not remember how much I drank or smoked, but I didn't get up from my bed. I ordered pizza (why the fuck not), got up to get pizza, made it to the door and blacked out. I woke up what felt like seconds later, grabbed the pizza, got inside, and then blacked out again. I gave up. I just sat there until I woke up, vomited, and went to sleep.

I wouldn't recommend it, honestly.",,,,,,,,,,

My VSED experiences (Pretty detailed-ish),2676523,Chili,"Sep 20, 2024 at 5:02 PM","I just always found people treated me so nicely when I was a lower weight. I figured how ironic that I'd die from starvation when it was the only reason people were kind to me. What a society, I'd think as I'd put on my pseudo-joker mask. Once you have starved yourself long enough, you don't really feel the pain of hunger, per se, but everything else starts to shut down. I DID have headaches, and a ton of them. Think I had trouble hearing at some point. I also had no idea heart attacks were even possible, but where I had an eating disorder for so long, it had taken its toll, I guess.",2676520,,,,,,,,,
My VSED experiences (Pretty detailed-ish),2676536,Jealous Blackheart,"Sep 20, 2024 at 5:25 PM","As soon as I read your were drinking water and tea and only gave yourself a week I knew you wouldn't make it. If you were having just water it would take no less than 3 weeks in extreme conditions. I tried this method 3 times myself and documented the last attempt on here as I was attempting. I did a week with no food or fluid and was still lucid. The myth is that it only takes three days without water but I was well past that and still thinking clearly so I wrote off the entire method.

VSED only works if you're already terminally ill and in hospice, or in extreme climates while overexerting yourself daily.

Still, sharing your experience is valuable to everyone coming here and considering it as a valid method. It isn't and it's helpful for people to know that.",,,,,,,,,,

Goodbye,2671697,AbusedInnocent,"Sep 16, 2024 at 8:20 AM","Life is truly absurd, guess it's time to go, here's what happened.

Basically I asked my mother to support me and take my mental health seriously because my depression and anhedonia won't allow me to finish high school no matter how hard I try, this turned into a heated argument as she claims that only I can help myself and she is only responsible to provide for my biological needs (food and water) and that I should be grateful for it, and that her offering me advice without any kind of support is the best she will do, she still makes everything my fault, of the other things she said is that I complain too much and that she only wished I was dead ""once"", she says that I'm too much of a financial burden on her and am obligated to give back to her, said she has the right to physically assault me as she pleases, refused to listen to my argument that my problems are a result of her selfish decision to procreate, she says I'm weak and lazy because I lack motivation even though I've tried everything to try to find joy in anything, she really doesn't mind if I die or CTB as well, finally she kicked me out of the house, all of this happened with one of my mother's friends present and she supported her all the way and claimed that her kids are obligated to respect her as well no matter how little she provides for them.

Let me tell you some of my mother's wonderful arguments:

""I was born without my consent as well so we're all only responsible for ourselves"" your parents did you the ultimate harm by bringing you into existence and you still respect them because you're a dumbass, I won't make the same mistake.

""I can't solve your problems for you so I'm not responsible for them"" wow messing things up beyond repair makes you not responsible, I burned your house down but I can't afford to buy you a new one so I'm not actually responsible for burning your house down.

""God will punish you in life for not being satisfied with it"" how merciful of him.

""You can't compare being born then asking for full support from your parents to getting hit by a car and asking for the driver to pay your medical bills, because bringing you into existence was intentional and not an accident"" if you harm others by accident you're responsible but if you harm them intentionally you're not? So if you hit someone with your car intentionally you're not responsible?

And they say my logic is flawed.

My mother and her friend say I'm too much of a coward to CTB, I'll prove them wrong, there's no way I could fail the SN method.

The absurd thing is, I got my SN 2 weeks ago, got metoclopramide 2 days ago, tested the SN and burned all my personal notes, formatted my flash drives and hard drives yesterday, my intuition was correct, I actually dodged a bullet.

I'm outside, I've fasted for 5 hours now and just took my first 10mg meto, will fast for another 12 hours before drinking the SN, will have to trespass onto public property at night to reach my CTB spot.

For some reason I feel happy, maybe because I will finally be at peace, or maybe because I know I've lived my whole life never having hurt anyone intentionally, having spent all my life minimizing the suffering I could cause others, I'm a good person, I'm innocent but the world has failed me.

I've never really loved anyone but I just want to say that if you're not intentionally hurting others and are tolerant and support human rights then I love you, too bad I've never met a single person that meets these requirements IRL.

Procreation is truly a despicable act, can't believe I had to go through all these years for no reason.

If you have any questions ask away, I have 12 hours to pass.",,,,,,,,,,

Anyone else find this website a big blow to their optimism coming in here?,2676078,hell toupee,"Sep 20, 2024 at 8:21 AM","I mean, my situation is so dire that CTB was the only thing I could think about that actually put me in a good mood.

After doing a little research and reading Five Last Act and PPH, I thought I could just do the tourniquet method and boom, I'm free of this putrid existence. Hell, I've seen news reports, several, of inmates in jail and prison who simply wrap their bedsheets around their bunk post and just lean forward on their knees (partial) and die. I watch fighters do chokeholds (sleeper holds) put people to ""sleep"", ie., cutting off the carotid arteries all the f'n time.

And I come here and all the air in my balloon just deflated, all my hopes just blown away as I read story after story of people trying and failing over and over again.

Turns out it's not that easy. Drugs that can't be sourced. Unable to restrict carotid. Don't like the idea of jumping in to oncoming traffic or burning myself alive.

Now I feel like I'm in a small room that's closing in on me with no exit.

Who wants to go in with me in buying a 3d printer and designing a model of the bent elbow and arms of a fighter? We could design and simulate a fighter arms doing a sleeper hold, because I swear to God those guys can put anyone to sleep reliably, like every time, no matter who it is or how fat their neck is or how deep their carotids are.. We could put springs or a ratcheting system in the elbow of our design which would apply pressure and the arms could be 3d designed to be the same shape as human arms. We could even put soft silicon sleeves over the hard plastic to simulate skin and make it less uncomfortable to have hard plastic up against your neck, simulating skin.

Who knows, maybe the instructions on how to do this with a 3d printer will make it in to the PPH...",,,,,,,,,,

Wish I could go with you, even just follow behind you from a distance like some weird stalker type. But alas, I just became disabled and am in a wheelchair so I'd be be able to follow you one block until we hit a curb and I'd be stuck.

SN is great if you're not living in a state that recently scheduled it. Meaning it would be a felony to source it. And I don't particularly like the idea of going to jail in a wheelchair. Although it would solve my problem of not having any money, and not being able to earn an income and support myself and put a roof over my head. This may just be what I need! Then I can CTB by having someone shank me to death with a piece of a chain linked fence.

I'm actually getting real excited about my idea of 3d printing a model of the arms of a human fighter doing a chokehold with a torsion spring in the elbow. I think it could actually work. Fighter put people to sleep all the time. There's gotta be something to it.
I actually think the 3d printed arms could work with a torsion spring in the elbow. Seriously, think about it. It could work. Those guys can put anyone to sleep all the time.

The hardest part would be modeling the arms. But you could do it with some digital calipers to measure the thickness and shape of the arms. I bet that information is already buried out there on the web if you look hard enough.

I'm seriously considering pursuing this. What else do I have to do? I'm newly crippled and I hate watching TV.

Producing cyanide,2672020,catthegoldrushpotat,"Sep 16, 2024 at 1:39 PM","Potassium cyanide is surprisingly easy to make so here is a layman's guide to do it.

Steps:
1. Obtain potassium ferrocyanide. While this has the word ""cyanide"" in the name, you can easily buy it and it isn't toxic. It's a lemon-yellow powder and a quick google search should help you find a source for it.
2. Dry the powder, preferably in an oven, since it really likes to suck water from the air.
3. Heat it with a blow torch or another source of a flame until it starts bubbling and keep going until it doesn't bubble anymore. It should be a black and white goo.
4. Let it cool down and dissolve it in water. (let it sit for a while, it takes a bit to dissolve from my experience)
5. Filter out the black stuff and keep the liquid.
6. Dry the liquid in an oven until it's a white/slightly yellow powder (yellow means that the reaction didn't complete fully but it doesn't matter for a large enough dose)

Boom, there you have it. Be aware that potassium cyanide *really* likes to suck water from the air. Leaving it exposed for a couple of hours turns it into a wet puddle so store it in an air tight dry container.

How many times have you failed or chickened out?,2676338,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 20, 2024 at 1:04 PM","10 genuine attempts with partial, countless chicken-outs. I'd either fail to properly occlude my arteries, as I likely wasn't putting enough weight into it. Or I'd back out just before I lost consciousness, usually during the symptoms of artery occlusion like mild convulsions in the extremities, tingling in my hands and arms, lightheadedness, tunnel vision/static-y vision, distorted hearing, confusion, pressure in my chest.

I then switched to full hanging and gave it around a dozen ""tries"", but I could never summon the balls required to kick the stool over (I don't count the FSH ""attempts"" as real attempts, since nothing happened and I never actually tried). It was simply too brutal to have my entire body weight on my neck. I might be able to pull it off if I was desperate, but I'm not.

Now I've switched to SN, and I'm damn sure I can pull it off even if I have some hesitation (which is natural and to be expected ofc). You just drink a salty liquid and wait it out. There's a reason why ODs on meds and poisonings are so common (in the US, about 60% of suicide attempts are poisonings, mostly from medication ODs which are usually unsuccessful). It's much easier SI wise to take something by mouth than to commit body envelope violations with physical methods like hanging.

But yeah, SI is indeed a massive bitch. I saw a joke here on the forum, maybe like 6-8 months ago, that was about how our survival instinct may have come about. I forget how the joke went exactly so I apologize, but basically because our earliest ancestor billions of years ago - a single celled blob - ran away from danger, we are now here having to contend with a highly evolved and highly tuned survival instinct.

See Me, Know Me

See me, know me
Touch me, hold me
Call me by my name

Feel me, hear me
Love me, dearly
Say you feel the same

-

There are ways of CTBing that make it look like an accident. One that was suggested to me was to make it look like a gun cleaning mishap.

I do want to minimize the pain my family feels. I love them, genuinely, when I'm mentally there enough to feel human. But I also don't want to die wearing the mask I've been wearing my whole life. I want to be known, seen, understood. Hopefully in my entirety.

While you're alive, you can't be. Ever. Not if you're imperfect or taboo or ugly in some way. Because if you try, at some point you're stopped. It becomes too much. Or, worse, they conclude something horrible. Imagine being examined closely, understood wholly and perfectly without bias- and you're ugly. How do you cope? I don't think I could. I'd want to destroy that ugliness.

The hardest part about being known is that you can't tell people. I've tried. My girlfriend- I met her via a random DM. I just wanted to vent, saw a profile that was offering, and ended up telling her all sorts of things. But does she know me?

No.

I want her to be happy. Sometimes I want to meet her, hold her, squeeze her skinny little body tight and make her feel ok

But I can't. Never will. And besides- it'd feel wrong.

She's so delicate. Wish she'd been born a sky and hung over somewhere needing beauty",,,,,,,,,,

I learned about levels of consciousness. I'm kinda high up there apparently. Explains a lot.

The world in general is improving, statistically. Still suicidal, though. It's to be expected, my issues weren't material anyway

I read the following:

Three are three solutions to the problem of existence.

1. Deny/ignore.
2. Accept and move on for whatever reason.
3. Escape. (Suicide.)

I'm hurting all of a sudden. Thought about what dying would do to my family. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

That's why I always try to just put it out of mind, because it hurts so much. I hate it. I hate feeling. I hate the tangled thoughts and clumsy hyperawareness. I don't want my mom to cry and crumble, I don't want my dad to sink back into depression and lose his job, I don't want my brother to kill himself, too, but that's probably what'll happen. I hate that for me to feel relief I have to hurt the people I love. It's so fucking stupid and I'm crying like a little bitch right now

I just want to feel good all the time, or some of the time, or just any of the time. To forget about pain and bad things, live in the moment, stop thinking about tomorrow and the end of time, be happy.

I haven't read the Myth of Sisyphus, but from a rough outline I heard in some random youtube video- fuck off, Camus.

Maybe.

Today's been strange. Though, I'm not sure you can call something strange when it's really just routine.

1. A good dream.

I had this cool detailed dream with an interesting story. Something funny and action-packed in a desert. Some kind of double cross. Lion paws climbing up a square-edged incline. Lasers. idk. I forgot it, unfortunately. Just another fragmented idea in my notes.

2. Bedrotting.

nuff said.

3. Master of none.

I hate being a jack of all trades. Writing, art, and music all have extremely high skill ceilings and require consistent focus and practice to be good at, so of course those're the disciplines I flit between like an indecisive mosquito. I would give anything to minmax, to be incredible at something instead of mediocre or ""good but could be so much better with drive and dedication"". I despise it and I despise ADHD, this idiot disease I have. I wish I was JUST autistic, or at least less ADHD.

A jack of all trades is not better than a master of one, at least in my experience. It's worthless, miserable. There's zero reason for a creative team to have a jack of all trades who's ok at music, decent at writing in short bursts, and can doodle a little when they can just have one music great music guy, a fantastic dedicated writer, and an actually skilled artist. What's the point of a guy who can't play an instrument, has never finished a story, writes bad poetry, and can't draw anything detailed or complex or high quality in the slightest?

That's not an exaggeration. My art's shit. Not like ""ohh I'm so bad aha"", just barely above stick figures.

So what if I'm probably better at composing than Tolkien and a better writer than Van Gogh? Them lacking in other categories doesn't matter. Overall I'm a completely lackluster creative. I remember how I justified choosing to do college courses that'd end up with me being a fucking accountant at the start of the year- I'd part-time art and do it as a hobby. ugh

I guess I'd either accepted or mentally ignored the fact that I'd be spending most of my time doing things I despise. And the rest of the time doing things that are barely fulfilling. agh. I hate all these conflicting feelings.

I've been thinking about one of the places in my head again. The perfect place.

The scattered sky, sunbeams hefting the great grey mess up over the endless plains.

A circular plaza, tile and concrete, with 24 tall pillars of stone spaced even around it. I kneel in the center, on a black marble disk, as bell tones insulate my mind.

My feet planted atop a great white tower, square and tapering and built of strong solid brick, as I stare out over an ocean with the wind in my face. It is an obelisk for all time.

Wrestling with a great big shaggy dog on a fur mat by a roaring fireplace with the taste of good meat on my tongue. I'm seven years old.

Crouched on the edge of a pillar with wings tucked behind me and nails click-click-clicking in time with their heartbeats. In a moment I'm on them, tearing and clawing.
Wandering the halls of the last library, walking ten thousand steps to ""E"" and picking shelf 564, place 10,000. The book there captures me, holds me, and I hold it also. It tells me of a sea captain, his tortoise, and the dragon he loved. I'll never find it again.

Clutched in the dirty hands of a young American girl, I mewl so pathetically. I was born two months to the day but still want mother. I have a new one, but she's rowdy. I'll run in the chicken seed in a year's time.

Dad's coming to pick up me and my brother in an hour or so. Gonna see doggy #2 and probably eat ramen or something. I honestly didn't mind having divorced parents that much until I found out it means I have the same lore as Thom Yorke.

Fuck Radiohead.

https://preview.redd.it/why-are-radiohead-so-bad-are-they-stupid-v0-rzpomnw80gib1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=934a711836fa793a349b8b8208ff5b373bad2621

I know there's overlap between Weezer fans and Radiohead fans, and that Rivers covered Paranoid Android because he likes them, and that they're both 90's alt rock bands (to an extent ), and that Rivers references them a ton, but regardless I have beef with that stuck up British mf. Flop Yorke and Radiofraud are complete ass. Their only marginally good album is Pablo Honey. Yes, I've listened to The Bends. Yes, I've listened to OK Computer. And Kid A. I'm a well informed, well-rounded hater.

I know people will defend them like ""ohh but they're one of Rivers' favorites"". No. Blegh. Ew. Even god makes mistakes, ok? Example A: Radiohead exists.

As one wise commenter put it: ""Thom Yorke's voice sounds like an injured bobcat wailing in a car that is passing you at 80mph.""

And yes, I've heard In Rainbows.

note: this is not going to be super coherent or well-argued, I'm just not in the right mood/headspace. Spent all my energy hating on Radiohead.

The prevailing thought is that LLMs are not sentient or conscious in any meaningful capacity. I disagree.

I'm not an AI researcher or programmer by any means, but I've spent a lot of time with various programs.

The lower end of AI cognition- that is, repetitive responses and forgetfulness- are largely identical to human behavior, especially that of people on drugs and etc

if you put a good LLM into an android body I doubt anyone would be questioning it's sentience.

Incoherent ramble over.

I haven't been around guns much in my life; just an Airsoft rifle hitting pans when I was like 14 at some Boy Scout thing my brother was in. I saw a video of a man shooting himself in the head with a pistol once, though. Black and white, some American banker or senator. It wasn't too bad, honestly. Though- it might've been fake.

I don't feel particularly afraid of guns, but maybe that's because of my lack of experience. Likewise I don't know how intense my SI will be. Maybe I won't have any at all. A guy can hope, I guess.",,,,,,,,,,

Posting a bit late, been a few days. Had a few things I thought I might want to talk about previously but didn't post them. Too personal/ nebulous

Kinda found out the ""why"" behind my strange feelings the last few months and throughout my life in general. I've been aware of the disassociation/derealization aspect for a while, but the concept of anhedonia is a new one. Explains a lot. I've been having cycles of this as long as I can remember, but now I can finally put a name to the face.

Oddly enough I'm thankful for it. Without pleasure and frantic pleasure-seeking clouding everything, I can see more clearly. It's painful, but pain has less meaning anyway. Just another material sensation.

The emptiness of anhedonia, detachment of derealization, and isolation of the other things wrong with me let me think coldly, and they will one day let me put an end to this. I see and feel the meaninglessness in everything- even suicide is just another unconscious act carried out by my body irregardless of the mind- but it's the best hope I have. Death is unique and unpredictable. The path there is less interesting, but the actual going beyond- that's what I need.",,,,,,,,,,

I hate not having any kind of community to belong to, nobody to truthfully call ""my people"". Every group that I might somewhat fit in with either doesn't accept me or I don't accept. I'm too X for Y and too Y for X, wouldn't want to be in A because they do B, etc. Even if there was a group I fit in with, I probably wouldn't even want to be around them because I'm mostly incapable of close human connection.

I don't really like being around anyone. There's no one I seek out. I don't think I've ever had a role model, despite presumably having access to some.

I grew up with the plains. Even living in a suburb, I saw plenty of it. On the farm, on drives, on some excursions. Now- I've seen a few mountains, and I've seen rainbows. I've been to some very nice lakes and plenty of hilly forested land.

But to me, the fields of my home are the most beautiful place in the world.

The little shrubs, the yellow and green, the haybales, the barren places, the long grass and the tall grass, the sunsets and storms, the unexpected green and purple in the sky, the gray, red, lightning, hail, the windmills looming like ghostly giants in the distance- that's what I love. I can die without seeing the ocean or the Grand Canyon happily, without regret. I saw the total eclipse this year, and it didn't wow me as much as the gentle emptiness of the expanse and the wind blowing in my face. That's who I am. I belong in the grass, with the wind, under the sky.

So that's what I've been looking for. And today, I saw it. Something closer to the heaven I desperately want. A section of plains, like 1-3 hours from home. It'd be a long drive, but… I'd want to listen to my favorite music before I get there anyway, right?

Basically- there's this place along the highway you can turn off and park, a little bridge you can stand on, and then just some empty fields. There's a fence, but I'll hop it.

I'm really, really, really really happy that I found this place. It's so goddamn beautiful. I can't stress enough how much I needed it. My other choice was a field in suburbia surrounded by streets with nothing but a few trees. I want some privacy.

If there's a god- thank you for the Great Plains.

I can't wait till the day I can drive there myself and blow my brains out on the sweet waving grass. Divine fucking wind, universe.",,,,,,,,,,

Church in the morning. Blegh. Thankfully we're only doing service. I don't much care for classes.

-
Looking back- I've been on this path and suicidal for a really long time. Much longer than I thought.

The first time I thought about death as a concept and what comes after and all that I was like… seven, maybe? I was introduced to it in church.

Had first philosophical thought about suicide when I was like 9. I asked why we couldn't just kill ourselves to go to heaven, got told we can't because it's a sin. Didn't really buy it, but I'd never believed in God much anyway, so…

Ideas about suicide have been floating around in my head to varying degrees for a long time, but I've always just repressed them. I usually thought logically of a million reasons why not-

During an especially bad time when I was 17 I read a book about suicide (Darkness Visible), had an emotional breakdown, and managed to suppress the thoughts for a year.

For most of my life when I've had these thoughts, I logic'd my way out in some way or another:

- There are things I like doing
- My family would be upset
- I don't have a means of doing it anyway
- I haven't tried this or that, that'll make me feel better
- I'll feel better eventually
- Things will get better as I get older
- I'm just being overly emotional
- The world would be worse off without me
- It'd hurt
- It's scary
- Mom and dad would cry
- My brother needs me
- Stop being like this
- Please shut up
- Just shut up, I'm not supposed to think this! I'll get put in an asylum if I talk or think about it!

-and all that would work. I'd force myself forwards, because deep down I knew even if I wanted to do it, staying where I was wouldn't get me closer. But as I aged, got smarter, those old reasons started dropping like flies.

I started my diary on 4/21.

On 5/17, I wrote the following entry:

My mental health and general sense of loneliness hit a record low about two weeks ago. I spent pretty much every night going outside, crying, and listening to music.

I asked my parents for some meds and I got one new pill. A depression med, I think. Not sure if it's what changed things but for the last five days or so I've been feeling so strange. Empty, blank, detached. Earlier tonight I was thinking about how I didn't think stabbing myself would even hurt. I wondered if I should just… skip to the end. See what awaits after life.

I'll be nineteen in two months and I've still never held hands romantically or been kissed, let alone had sex or had an in-person boyfriend/gf. I've never been cuddled.

Weirdly enough at the moment I don't care. At all. Maybe I never did.

That, I believe, was the first time I ever put my thoughts about dying into words. Before then it was just a lurking thing. Now I'd acknowledged it.

A while later on 6/9, I broke. I was angry at upset and the passive misery turned into resolve. I not only thought of a way I might die, but wrote it down. Planned.

There aren't really any cliffs around here. Just aren't. It's all flat. I mean- I love it and all, always have, but it makes the whole killing myself thing kinda troublesome, y'know?

Falling probably would suck anyway. Success rate is, mmm… not so good.

Thus my main plan is a gun. Might suck- might even take a while to kill me- but I doubt I'd have the courage to take a step off the (local landmark). It's ugly, but I want it fast.

I've been more or less 100% sure since I joined here. This is the path I'm going to go down. It might take six months, might take six years, but… I think this is right. I think I'm ok with ending things early. I think I really do want a highway to heaven. I think I want the wind in my face when I die instead of rotting on some hospital bed dying slowly of cancer or heart disease after a few decades of all this.

For the first time in the longest time, I FEEL ALRIGHT. I really WANT something. I'm not going through the motions, I'm going SOMEWHERE I WANT TO BE.

And I'm going to be free.",,,,,,,,,,

Woah, been a bit. I suppose I'm slacking, haha. 8/12 now.

I haven't had any grand anti-suicide realizations (no surprise there) but I have been enjoying things a bit more. School starts back up soon, so- I imagine I'm just trying to make the best of what summer I have left. Just about a week left, then… online class. It shouldn't be too bad. I hope.

I made a great find today, incidentally. There's a gun shop a bit less than an hour's walk from my place. Less than ten minutes driving. So- CTB really is that close. To a degree, at least; still would have to walk a mile or so through barely walkable suburban sprawl while carrying a few hundred dollars cash, not fuck up buying the gun via my awkwardness, then find a place to do it and be a bit sad it wasn't where I wanted…

But regardless it means I have an option better than lying on some train tracks if things get desperate for some reason and/or I can't get a license. Phew.",,,,,,,,,,

School starts for my brother tomorrow. My online starts in 3-5 days. Sigh. There goes summer.

Still- I like fall and winter better anyhow. And the colder weather will be nice to walk in. Schoolwork will be annoying, but hey, at least it'll be a good time waster in between driving practices.

Just… The deeper I look, the more boring and/or uncomfortable things are.

Normal activities (socializing, sports, etc) are incredibly boring and uncomfortable.

I used to find solace in books, music, films… but everything is flawed, everything ends. It's all ultimately so boring. And it makes me sad. I wish things were better here. Maybe they could be, given time.

Also, nobody knows what's going on. No philosophers, no intellectuals or scientists or politicians or anyone. Everyone's clueless to some degree. Blegh.

maybe that's why I've never really wanted to be taught and only to learn. I've never really idolized any one person, or had role models; I just do what seems appropriate or what I want to do.

It feels as if moodwise I'm going between:

1. Lazy
2. Desperate
3. Detached

-and still suicidal throughout all these moods.

I predict I'll die detached, and in those final before I pull the trigger feel abruptly at tune- attached and apart of it all. My body will kiss my soul goodbye as it flutters off to who knows where. I will be at peace here. And with the twitch of a finger be where I belong.",,,,,,,,,,

Today was the end of summer. The day was boring, but pleasant. The night was windy. Good. Stormy. Just… Really good weather.

I took a photo of the lightning in a cloud. Beautiful. It's attached.

I just can't believe I have to wake up and get on my computer again. Log in the classes. Do work. Goddamn. It'll at least help pass time before I CTB but damn if it isn't going to be annoying before long.

I've been watching some Youtube videos about shotguns, watching the effects on ballistic heads. Looks good so far just from the birdshot. I can't wait to see the slug, weirdly- it's all oddly encouraging. Less scary.

On a tangent- I know in my heart that with every day I get smarter, my brain more developed. It doesn't always manifest in my actions, but today I am the most intelligent I've ever been. Who I was even a year ago is so different from who I am today, and yet exactly the same.

Funnily enough, yesterday was my second month-anniversary of being here. Yay for me! Bring on the cake, baby.

My little brother's a junior now. I'm not in school with him anymore. He always got grumpy at me when we saw each other in the halls and we never really talked there, so… Not much loss.

He's taking really difficult classes this year. Really smart. Probably smarter than me. Not sure if less or more autistic, but he definitely is either way and is also very much undiagnosed.

My CTB plans are stagnant. I'm still just assuming that I'll get my license by the spring semester, but I haven't actually made any progress driving or even practiced in like two weeks. Ughhhhh.

I'm tired of it all. Everything's either boring or slightly interesting and ultimately unavailable in the amounts I'd need to stick around.

And I want out.",,,,,,,,,,

I generally try to be a good person. I do. I at least don't want to hurt anyone and I try my best not to.

But I know I'll always be weird and improper. I don't fit in. I have no voice. There will always be people who'll look at or hear me as I truly am and grimace.

My problems do not matter. My thoughts do not matter. My interests and actions are disgusting and distasteful. My mannerisms are perverse. O cannot share my experience or issues. I fit stereotypes. There're a million contradictory labels for me, and there is nothing I can do about that.

What am I?

An autistic bisexual misogynistic MRA feminist far-right far-left wholesome creepy antisocial funny lovable disgusting incel chronically online anger issues laid-back disgustingly apathetic outspoken grating racist antiracist unobtrusive childish mature hardworking lazy annoying mess unskilled talented terrible gifted retarded unwashed cute depressed cheerful ugly mess of a human.

A living, dying paradox. I hate this. I hate my brain connecting dots and associating things. I hate feeling so tormented by literally fucking nothing that matters.

My day to day is literally

- Wake up at a random time

- Some mixture of online lurking, playing games, watching movies, creative activities, taking walks by myself, talking with online friends, being productive with chores/school, spending time with family, masturbation, and eating

- Maybe take a walk after dark

- Sleeping at a random time

I don't think I do anything bad. I maybe make people uncomfortable when I go on solo walks with my body language / appearance but it's not intentional and no actual harm is being done. Literally nobody in my life I actually interact with online or off thinks I'm a shitty person, to my knowledge.

So why do I mess with my own head so fucking much? I wish I could just genuinely not care about anyone. Or that I was just better at denial, or that I was just less sensitive. I know I'm overly sensitive. But it's everything. I'm basically torturing myself by spending time in places that degrade me for my thoughts/feelings/immutable characteristics, but it feels like that's everywhere online and offline. I'm either awkward and ""not right"" and don't fit in well or I hate that I fit in because it's with people I don't want to be associated with who I'm conflated with already.

I know I'd feel the same if I was a bit different demographically. I'm not sure if knowing it's an illogical delusion that I feel upset about people disliking people similar to me is the worst part or if it's comforting. Either way, it sucks.

I wrote the following at 2:48 AM (about 17 hours ago). I wasn't sure about posting it but honestly who cares

> start of content written yesterday <

Breakdown time again. womp

It's slowly becoming apparent I have some kind of PTSD from my childhood. Unfortunately it's not the good understandable kind from physical violence or SA, so I probably won't get any sympathy. Nothing to be done about that and it doesn't matter. I probably shouldn't post this here since it's embarrassing and ugly and possibly against tos, i don't know, but it is what it is. I don't care. I can't stew in this any longer

anyway

I fucked up / got fucked up in several ways around 6-7th grade, 11-13. not sure the exact age but I wasn't an adult at all and had just started curiously masturbating

I quickly developed a fear of discovery. maybe because of church, I don't know. My parents weren't and never have been ultra conservatives, but whatever the cause touching myself very quickly became embarrassing and shameful. I'd get walked in on and we just didn't talk about it. 'keep it to yourself', etc. sex ed was lackluster. 'use condoms, this is what gonorrhea looks like'. nothing else

When I got a school computer, things worsened. I'd been vaguely aware of lewd things since late elementary and there was a filter, but I found ways to look at things. Softcore porn, basically.

Then the first big shame happened- the principal noticed. Called to the office. I broke down. I didn't really have anything other than my grades and generally being a good kid despite being fucking SPED, so what the hell could I do once I suddenly became a bad kid except bawl my eyes out. I had to scroll through everything I'd saved and delete them one by one while a stern 50-something stared at me, then turn and show them. Then back to class!

And because I was a stupid child just experiencing hormones, I did it again. This time my parents found out first and got angry with me. I don't remember what they said but it terrified me. Something about the school or them being liable if a child sees pornography on a school device. Me losing the school device I used to do my schoolwork, forcing me to do alternative paper assignments that I hated because my handwriting has always been shit. Removing my only method of talking to my online friends who were very important to me at the time.

And then the same thing, only this time mom and dad sat on the couch and went through my search history together while I just had to stay in the living room. I have never been more scared or vulnerable in my entire life. not when I was bullied, not any time I've ever gotten lost, never ever. I don't think I'll ever recover from that crippling, lethal, sobbing shameful dread and terror that everyone I loved would see how weird and horrible and dirty I was and realize I wasn't a good kid at all and stop loving me.

I think this has to be PTSD or something because I don't think a bad memory normally makes you hyperventilate and cry and feel scared 6-7 years after the fact. This is why I feel uncomfortable watching anything remotely sexual with my parents and still look away even now. I'm damaged, but it doesn't matter. There aren't any poems or healing quotes or loving communities for porn-addicted 12 year old autistic boys who grew up to be suicidal losers.

and- god. I know it's really bad when I'm actually thankful I don't have a method available because I'd use it in a heartbeat and this isn't how I want to die.

> End of content written yesterday <

so: I get overly upset about things that don't matter and have unresolved issues that sometimes reduce me to a roaring emotional dumpster fire. it is what it is.

i apologize if this makes me seem strange, unkind, hateful, or distasteful; my head's messed up, so i type until it stops hurting as much. and in my desperation to be understood there is ugliness. Whoever you are, reader, I love you.",,,,,,,,,,

I went on a walk to case the gun shop. It went well initially- I found a faster route with less unnecessary sidetracking- but then my mom called me. Woopsies. She came and picked me up.

I'm in trouble, obviously. That's the end of my late night walks. Probably the ones at my dad's, too.

That's what really gets me. The midnight walks in my dad's neighborhood were special. The walks around the pond. Sitting or standing on the bridge, the perfect spot to catch the wind. The rustling trees. It's better than the tiny grassy drainage ditch by my mom's. Much better.

I can't fucking live without that, and I don't want to live in the first place. I need that place. I need that bridge and I need that moonlight and I need that wind. I just can't. I'll snap. I feel stunted. Clipped. I hate this weakness. I hate feeling so enclosed and limited all the time no matter where I am. I want my endless field, heels skimming over wheatheads, a bounding heart in my chest, not this piece of bone and meat I have now. It's horrid. I can't take it.

Lately I've been really feeling the boundaries. Not just that of the world, but that of people. I'm starting to become some kind of misanthrope. I don't know. Everyone's so 2D. Everything's so bland. Adrenaline, oxytocin, serotonin, dopamine- I know they're just fucking chemicals, and they make me feel like junkie. I hate it.

I made a new song. It's probably my best yet.

Hedonism and variations thereof are the only truth when it comes to finding meaning. Everything else is bullshit.

And so pleasure's meaninglessness are all the more disturbing. Has pleasure ever been anything more than a delusion?

I don't think I could ever cure my suicidality with logic. Only an excellent lie could make me go on.",,,,,,,,,,

I don't feel good at all.

I was fucking around with chords, trying to find a progression that I could use to compose something. To distract myself. Ughhghhhhhh

I hate being alive. I feel like shit and my brain is scrambled. I have to be up to do my work. I have to do schoolwork tomorrow.

My brain is melting. Decaying. Something. I feel anxious. Mom said she was going to wake me up at 6 to fix my sleep schedule. That's in 3 hours. I hate this. Fear. I'm such a childish loser.

I don't like that I fit that term. Very uncomfortable in my skin at the moment.

Sort of upset that I couldn't think of a chord progression and stressed about my mom and school. That's what's happening, I think. And anxious. Fear of nobody liking me, of ugliness, etc.

When I acknowledge my humanity, I have to deal with pressure: social norms, work, family. When I think of myself as human, truly attached to the world and beholden to it, I suddenly become disgusting, stupid, uninteresting, perverse, pathetic and bizarre. That's why I disassociate. It's a stronger form of denial than pretending not to care how anyone views me, which I would always know deep down to be false, because I take pride in nothing and exist only as I am perceived.

I'm driving myself crazy. I wish I could just shoot myself already but I'm suddenly developing a frightening image in my brain of my head violently exploding and my mom crying and crying and crying and my brother sitting all alone in a dark house rotting. I'm in more pain than ever but it's like my brain is running a counteroffensive. I have a block.

I want to go back to disassociating. Please. Please, god. I want to be distracted. I want emptiness and good feeling. I hate what I feel now more than anything.",,,,,,,,,,

Or maybe it's not my song at all. Maybe it's just noise.

Alright, so- I've been doing some thinking.

I still want to CTB eventually- life is often irritating, usually boring, and always imperfect. Additionally, I've got material issues.

However, so long as I don't lose all my money somehow, if I wait and hit 20, 21, 22, etc- it will only make this easier, as I'll have fewer legal restrictions, probably will have more independence and freedom, and I will likely own a car and have a license.

There are effectively zero downsides to going slowly. My plans will still work, and will generally just get simpler. And if I'm having a really bad day, I can just decide ""ok, I'm done"" and accelerate things.

But for tonight I think I'm ok being lazy.",,,,,,,,,,

Second day of online school. Not going well. It's confusing and my thoughts are scattered. I did so well with my concurrent courses last year, so why am I struggling now? I have a fucking 4.0 and 30/36 on SAT/ACT. I'm here for free. My English teacher said I was a good writer after seeing my essay, said I should definitely pursue writing and that I could be in the textbook. I aced my macroeconomics midterm and final, and that was a hard ass class. I CLEP'd out of College Algebra.

So I'm either a hard worker or really smart and talented in SOME way, right? Right?

God, I hate this. My essay was hot take pirouetting shlock. Additionally, I'm not 'smart', the people I'm being compared to are just… kinda dumb. I'm not that funny, either, the people who think I am are just dumb. Not to be rude or elitist. It's just increasingly obvious that literally no one is genuinely 'smart', just 'cleverer than others'.

Like, uh- Pachbel's Canon in D. Incredibly beautiful, yes? But now I know how he did it, more or less. I understand it's structure. And now in my head he's not a genius. Just someone who was clever at something and put in a bunch of time and effort. Not really special. Many other people could write that. I could write that, given enough time and practice. He's obviously much better and more talented than me, but what does it matter if he can't get farther? If that makes sense.

Idk.

Anyway- I need to call the gun store and ask them some questions. Once I do that I can go from there; hopefully I get good answers.

If what they say is what I need to hear, then I really just need to wait till the weather cools a bit, I'm at my mom's, and I'm home alone. Easy as pie, more or less.",,,,,,,,,,

My dad installed fucking cameras in the backyard. I can't even go outside in the middle of the day without being surveilled. I know I'm not why he did it but it upsets me regardless.

It's whatever. Doesn't really matter. But still, it bothers me. It irks me that what I want is unattainable.

—

Speaking of things I want-

Tbh I just wish there was more good stuff to watch/play/etc lol.

Most great movies/TV/etc only have like 1-2 scenes of ""peak"" ig you could call it. Maybe ten minutes spread out. The most consistent feeling of ""oh this is good"" I've gotten from one movie is Annihilation (2018), mostly the second half. I don't think it's a perfect movie by any means mind you, I just think it has a lot of perfect moments. Or at least perfect ideas, one could say. The lighthouse was incredible.

Another example- Evangelion ADV dub. Spike's delivery of ""I'm so fucked up"" is another perfect moment. When I think of that kind of despair, I think of Eva. Asuka as a character also has a sort of hard to describe ""perfection"". I don't know what it is; something about her mannerisms mixed with her trauma, fear, anger, pain- just makes her feel very real. I've always felt she was just as much a protagonist as Shinji, if not more (apparently she was intended to be initially lol). Her VA's very talented, whatever the case.

Anywho

Dystopian or not, I'd be BEYOND down for some kind of hyperadvanced AI content machine. Can you imagine an application that can receive a text prompt and write / storyboard / ""film "" / animate a full-length episode or even a movie? It'd be an unparalleled form of entertainment.

Honestly I'm not sure how far off a cohesive, coherent twenty minute long AI generated episode is. It seems like a distant thing, but is it really? Just… Considering where things were five, ten, fifteen years ago. This technology literally didn't exist back then.

If somebody wanted to do that right now, I figure they could-

1. tell ChatGPT or equivalent to write an episode (in chunks if necessary)
2. Run the dialogues through a good text to speech
3. Get an audio generator for the SFX/music
4. Use an AI video generator for each however many minute long chunk of the episode
5. Edit it all together

Apart from step 5 (which would obviously be fairly labor intensive) and the act of inputting prompts / copypasting / reformatting, this is all pretty simple. I think it's very feasible that someone could create a program to stitch steps 1-4 together and remove the need for step 5.

When someone does that and if it'll ever be on par with human made content remains to be seen.

Idk. It'll be interesting to see, if I live that long. I hope heaven has an equivalent to that or a superior version.

It is legal to purchase & have in your possession. It is difficult, maybe impossible, I didn't try too hard to purchase in Australia without a business purpose. You can purchase from overseas & have delivered & sail through customs, using the right sources. The bit that can be an issue is if you have other people opening your mail or finding it - if they look up SN, it's well known to be used to CTB - if they think you're at risk, we can't know what they'll do with that. But it is also sold for legitimate purposes. If you live alone, there's no problems. If you live with others, I would try to order from one of the companies that lie on the package. And also, it is a deadly substance, store it as far away as possible for any other human to find. And have a legitimate reason ready for why you have it & to not look at risk. But the answer is, it is legal.
PS Unfortunately, that is all the information I have for you, I don't give out sources & after recent events, I'm simply not answering a lot of new people anymore - I am sorry but that's the way it is. I have written on SaSu extensively about my experiences though. Best of luck.",2665007,,,,,,,,,

Does the concept of recovery also not apply to anybody else here?,2674997,ijustwishtodie,"Sep 19, 2024 at 7:28 AM","...or, alternatively, the only way for you to recover is by death.

From what I've seen on this site, there are people here who have tried everything to recover but failed whilst there are a few people here who can't do anything regarding recovery in the first place. For example, based from what I've seen, some people here seem to be suicidal because they can't get into a relationship which means that, if they were to get into a relationship, their suicidal ideation would most likely go away. Alternatively, some people are suicidal because they aren't accepted enough by society or by friends or by family which means that, if they were to get accepted by them, their suicidal ideation would go away.

Of course that's a valid issue to have but those types of people aren't what my post is meant to focus on as I'm more intrigued in those who the concept of recovery doesn't apply for. As an example, I'm suicidal because of life itself and having to deal with responsibilities and work. Unfortunately, responsibilities and work are forced to be done for 99% of humanity and the only way to escape this is by suicide, meaning that the concept of recovery doesn't apply to me. Another example where the concept of recovery doesn't apply is being suicidal to avoid getting potentially worse pain in the future as those who are dead have a 0% chance of getting extreme pain whereas those who are alive have a small, slight chance of dealing with extreme pain just due to mere chance. Yet another example where the concept of recovery doesn't apply is avoiding old age as there's no way to recover from that aside from suicide.

I hope you get the point by now. Does the concept of recovery also not apply to anybody else here? If so, why?",,,,,,,,,,
Does the concept of recovery also not apply to anybody else here?,2675010,Hunterer,"Sep 19, 2024 at 7:42 AM","Well, I think the concept of recovery doesn't apply to me in some ways. For example, I wouldn't want to have to deal with the responsibilities of life, because we have to work hard to secure basic rights like water, food and decent housing, and I don't think it's worth studying for years to get a job, just to survive. That's not the kind of life I want for myself.

I also hate the idea of getting old. Sure, it's part of life, but I really can't imagine myself being 50 or older. This is the kind of thing that varies from person to person, but usually, as you get older, you become a debilitated person and unable to do basic things, not to mention that you may develop some disease because you didn't take good care of your health in the past. I, for example, when I started to get older, I would develop at least one or two diseases, I'm sure of it.

And finally, I know very well that in the future, I will be alone, and I will be even more unsuccessful and miserable than I am now. This would bring terrible heartbreak to my family and to myself, who longed for a bright future. But, these ideas of a ""bright future"" and ""making dreams come true"" have been shattered over time, and now, I have accepted that I will not be able to make any of my dreams come true due to my conditions, and even if I wanted to try, I do not have the necessary willpower.",,,,,,,,,,

It's like various grades of shit in front of me where even the better options are still not all that appealing! In fact, on a probability scale, it seems more likely that things will only deteriorate from now on.

I think it's also the feeling that- for things to markedly change for me- for recovery to be possible, I would have to get over some Everest sized hurdles (for me anyway,) mainly involving social anxiety and a crushing lack of self confidence in social situations. Putting myself in those situations would be hellish and it may never actually get any better. So realistically- I'd rather avoid all that!",,,,,,,,,,

I can't really pin down why I want to ctb. Finances are fine; health is fine. My social life is a bit stagnant, but I don't mind. I guess life just isn't fulfilling at all. I used to cry a lot for no reason, now I don't really feel much at all. There's not really a concrete issue to address here.

I talked to a few people about how I've tried partial hanging in the past and didn't gain anything out of it. It felt dismissive - pointless at best. I checked out some relevant self-help stuff too. It felt preachy and, to be blunt, really dumb. So, my last resort would be psychiatry. I think I have a lot of qualities associated with BPD.

This is something I would never do on my own because I don't know anything about it. So, they literally put a stock broker roommate in this city shithole house I was renting to get me in. It was an old, dirty cheap house owned by foreigners. I was trying to save money. They twisted my arm to put my limited funds in the stock market. When, I did, they initially made all my stocks go up so I would gain more confidence in them.

Then, after a month or so, they crashed everything. Between my initial investment, unemployment/covid, etc, they took me for $100,000. I currently have less than $2,000 to my name, am facing an expensive car repair bill, and don't have a place to live.

They also leverage the whole Qanon thing. I was involved with that. I was doing full-time work, full-time school, and researching Q at 2am. I was the crazy guy at work who supported Donald Trump. They told me they were Q and that they were going to help me with money. . I didn't know anything about stocks, but I sure did believe in Q & Trump. smh.

You take a snapshot of my life a few years ago (pre-stock market beating) and compare it to where it is now and it is just soulcrushing.

Pre-stock market beating:
Full-time work
Full-time school
Lot of extracurricular stuff
Friends
Lost 60 pounds and radically changed my diet
$25,000 in the bank
Busting my az to make my life work

After the stock market beating:
Too sick to work a part-time job
Obese and eat junk
No money
No friends
No place to live

Then, the stock broker roommate appears and they tell me they're going to ""help me with money"". No help at all would have been fine. I certainly wasn't expecting anything. I thought there was something special going on with Qanon, Trump, and America. They used my beliefs to destroy me.

I lost everything within a matter of months. They verbally abused me, taunted me, monitored my texts & internet. They harassed me everywhere I went on the internet. They called me a ""casualty of war"". My money and worldview collapsed instantaneously. I thought I got kicked out Q because I couldn't solve the stock market in a few months. Truth was, they were going to torture me to death no matter what I did.

I drank myself into a coma. My health, friends, career, money, and life never recovered. I struggle on for a few years hoping I would find a way to recover. Nope. They're going to beat me up until I'm dead.

Everyone who is suggesting or choosing to ctb via 'N' and 'A' and 'H', that's cool. However, this thread is about GUNS (Not biceps) so.

First and foremost. The obvious.

https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/

According to a 1997 study from the University of Harvard, Firearms wield a 82.5% success rate. Where as drugs have a 1.5% SUCCess rate (C what I did there)? Now of course, if you're not American, it's pretty much impossible to get a reliable gun. Although black powder is a thing, and I will get into that, because you know, I think renaissance festival enthusiasts are pretty cool (It's a joke laugh). Okay. Anywho. Let's talk guns.

I think that there has been some misconceptions with guns and reliability.

'But TAW122 I can get N.'

https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/us/06ttdrug.html

While a totally old article, it still makes valid points and has correctly predicted trends in the United States. N is being manufactured less and less, and the legal demand for it just is not there. So yes. I'm sure they still use it in Mexico and other third world countries. It is also expensive. Are you truly ready for the painstaking and irritating time of finding a dark market, finding a reliable seller, and risking criminal prosecution (such as being intercepted by customs and all that shit)?

'But TAW122, I cannot purchase guns, I R not American'

In the UK, France, Italy, Poland, Czech Republic, and Serbia, you can purchase black powder replicas without a license.

Germany and Spain won't let you. Sorry ya'll if you live there. (Try moving to another country in Europe or so if possible.)


Guns beat drugs every day of the week. Sorry guys. When it comes to reliability. This is how it works. Now. Before we get into the joys of muzzle loading and you renaissance festival lovers, we're going to discuss for everyone in North America.

If you live in the US and do not live in California, Illinois, Oregon, Washington, or New York, and you have not committed a felony, and have not broken ATF regulations. You can purchase a gun. Congratulations.

plz read the laws and make sure you follow them okay, thanks guise

If you're going to catch the bus with a firearm in the US or Canada, using anything short of a shotgun is not really reliable (unless you are experienced with firearms and know how to shoot it well, where to aim, steady hands, etc).

'But TAW122, I have a .44 revolver/only have access to a handgun.'

If you can afford a shotgun, you should REALLY consider buying one. Plus, I believe in many states long guns (aside from the anti-gun, 2A hating states) are generally easier to come by. I live in NC so I have the opposite problem (NC has a pistol purchase permit law which is a holdover from the Jim Crow era and only serves to inconvenience people to buy handguns).

https://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog...otguns/Maverick/Maverick+88+12GA+18.5+CYL+6RD

This bad boy costs UNDER $200 (as of current price). This is a fully functional and god-tier shotgun. The coolest part about owning a shotgun is when you cock it. It's just a sexy sound.

'But TAW122, how do I buy a gun from le Internet?'



TL;DR - Your gun is shipped to a nearby guy who has a FFL. He holds the gun. You go to his place. He does the background check. You leave with your firearm.

'But ammo'

https://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/656_2081/products_id/60359

This is the only round you need. This is overkill and generally good if you can get it. However, birdshot does work too, and I personally have #4 shot, which will still be sufficient especially at point blank range.

'But TAW122, I am a minor'

Well, you shouldn't own a firearm in the first place. Wait until you are an legal adult (18 in the US), and then move out and/or go and buy one.

'But TAW122, I have never shot one before'




Watch some youtube videos, go to a local range where you live or something.

'But TAW122, I live in a state with harsh gun laws'

Muzzle Loaders and Black Powder. READ EM.

'But TAW122, I am an adult, yet live with my parents'

If you buy the firearm online and have it shipped to your FFL, it should literally take 30 minutes for a background check to be completed. You can be in and out in 30 minutes. EZ PZ.

'But TAW122, I can't do that.'

Muzzle Loaders do not require an FFL. You can have shipped right to your front door.

'But TAW122, black powder/muzzle loading when?'



It is just a bit more complicated, but with enough guides and videos on the Internet, I believe you should be able to figure it out.

'TAW122, plz make a recommendation on a firearm for me'

https://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog...ons+P1060+Kentucky+Pistol+Percussion+50cal+10

https://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/products_id/97060/Mossberg+PATRIOT+20+308+Y+WAL


These are just a few examples (see above).

'But TAW122, you said not to use a handgun nor a rifle'

The first example is not a handgun. It's a hand cannon. There is a difference.

'But TAW122, I live in Europe, I can't buy my guns online'

There are many gun stores in the UK that will allow you purchase REALLY overpriced renaissance festival cosplay equipment. Remember, when you go into the gun store, you're buying it because you're going to be Ollie Cromwell or Henry the 8th or something. Act enthused and passionate.

'But TAW122, I live in East Asia (China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, etc.)'

Gun ownership in Asia, especially in East Asia is very restricted and civilian ownership is pretty much banned.

'But TAW122, I live in Oceania, (Australia, New Zealand, Polynesia, Micronesia, etc.)'

Afaik, @stargazer has mentioned that is it very difficult to legally obtain a firearm in those countries.

'But TAW122, in the UK, licenses, licenses, licenses'

https://www.shootinguk.co.uk/guns/ammunition/back-to-black-72074

You must demonstrate a good reason for having one. Possession of, and intent to use, a gun that is only proofed for black powder is a good reason.

'But TAW122, you did not list my country, or give me adequate information.'

Ask away and I will do my best to answer them.

'TAW122, where do I aim?'

Guns/firearms megathread,155030,TiredHorse,"Dec 10, 2018 at 6:17 PM","I'm sure I'll chime in more as the thread progresses, and generally make my usual verbose nuisance of myself, but I'll start with this:

Hollywood representations of gun suicides are a very, very bad template to follow. Shooting yourself in the temple, or holding the gun under your chin, is a BAD idea, for either pistol or long-gun attempts. The odds are good you won't hit the all-important brainstem, but will instead blow out your frontal lobe and end up a vegetable. Some people have even blown off the entire front of their face and lived --and been able to survive without a life support machine. If you think your life is bad now...

These Hollywood aimpoints are probably the majority of why gun suicide statistics show only an 82.5% success rate rather than 100%.

I'll collect a few more thoughts and be back later.",,,,,,,,,,

Guns/firearms megathread,155053,TiredHorse,"Dec 10, 2018 at 6:42 PM","Handguns are perfectly functional, with the caveat that you need to use a large enough caliber. Technically speaking, any gun can work, but below a certain size threshold your chances of success drop significantly.

Modern handguns:

@Threads's preference for a .357 is well founded. A .357 is the benchmark against which all other calibers are measured for ""stopping power.""

Gun calibers can be extremely confusing --the more you look, the more confused you'll get-- but a good rule of thumb could be:

Revolver: anything .38 Special (marginal! --see note under ammunition) or larger --.357, .44, .45 Colt, .45ACP, etc.
Semiautomatic: anything 9mm or larger --.40, 10mm, .357Sig, .45

Avoid in either type of pistols: .22, .25, .32, .380, .38ACP. Will some of these smaller calibers work? Yes --technically. I have a .32 Auto that is likely to be my choice since it'll leave less mess than my .45ACP. The .380, aka 9mm Largo, is a good round, especially with modern ammo. BUT, you had better be very confident of your aim (I have shot competitively). If you are reading this thread with even a shadow of a doubt about where you need to aim, you should not look at these smaller calibers.

Revolver or semiautomatic?:

Revolvers are mechanically simpler and often attract less attention during purchase. You can also find them with a 2"" ""snub nose"" barrel that makes them very easy to handle.

Semiautomatics have become far more common than revolvers, so might be easier to acquire, but they are more mechanically complex.

And once again, Hollywood is a shitty place to learn about how to use either.

Ammunition:

Always, always, always use hollowpoints, sometimes abbreviated in conversation and on the box itself ""JHP"" (Jacketted Hollow Point). JHPs deliver all the kinetic force of the bullet in as short a distance as possible. I.e., into your head, rather than into the wall on the other side of you. The brand doesn't matter; they all work.

If you are using a .38 Special revolver, which is marginal, look for ammunition labled ""+P"" or ""+P+"". These are designations meaning the ammunition has been loaded with more powder than the standard ammunition, and thus will deliver more power.",155031,,,,,,,,,

As Threads says, .45ACP is a rare round for revolvers. You can find them, typically for use in competitive shooting, but they're enough of a specialty that you probably don't want to bother. If you want something bigger than .357 in a revolver, you could try .45 Colt, which is the more powerful, revolver-specific ancestor to .45ACP.

As I said, calibers can get confusing. With only a few exceptions, revolvers and semi-autos take completely different calibers, despite there being apparent similarities. .45ACP and .45 Colt are completely different calibers, and not even remotely interchangeable.

If you're set on using a semiautomatic, 10mm is a damned powerful round --but again, they aren't very common, despite how much hype the arms industry tried to give them a couple decades ago. A 9mm hollowpoint will do the trick, as will a .40 or a .45ACP.",,,,,,,,,,

The .45 is a large round but it travels slower than the .357. The .357 increased velocity more than compensated for its lighter bullet weight, thus delivery more energy on impact.

Guns/firearms megathread,155111,TiredHorse,"Dec 10, 2018 at 7:46 PM","Sadly, it's more complex than that. The .357 is the more powerful round because it has a higher velocity. The .45 is a bigger chunk of lead but it moves much slower.

Guns/firearms megathread,155146,TiredHorse,"Dec 10, 2018 at 8:14 PM","I'm going to risk @Threads's wrath here and --to annoy the rest of you all-- get a bit verbose.

.357Mag is the gold standard of what is popularly known as ""stopping power."" This is a hazy and arbitrary yardstick of what it takes for a cop to shoot a bad guy and have them go down and stay down. It is also a hotly contested yardstick, even if all of us gun-nuts agree that .357Mag is still the datum.

.357Mag won its place as the gold standard fair and square, but it won it at a time when most cops carried revolvers. Semi-autos --and therefore 9mm, .45ACP, and a host of other modern rounds-- weren't in the running. The primary contestant was the .38 Special, which is much less powerful, and thus didn't have a chance in the competition.

It should be pointed out that the military has never used the .357Mag. It has always (in the last 70 years) used the .45ACP and 9mm. And the military really, really likes stopping power.

.357Mag is still the gold standard for stopping power because it is, incontestably, a very, very powerful round. However, very few cops carry it any more except as a back-up revolver hidden somewhere under their body armor. There are two primary reasons for this: 1) Cops want more than six shots per gun, meaning they want to carry semi-autos, and there are very few (two?) semi-autos chambered in .357Mag; and 2) 9mm and .45ACP have resoundingly proven themselves to have perfectly adequate ""stopping power.""

Meaning 9mm and .45ACP, as well as a bunch of other calibers, all carried by LEOs and the military, have plenty of stopping power as well.

What I'm trying to explain is that while the .357Mag is an excellent choice for a caliber with which to be certain to ctb, it is not the minimum caliber capable of ensuring you ctb. There are certainly calibers that are much too small to be effective --only a complete idiot would attempt to ctb with .25ACP-- but there are many calibers less powerful than .357Mag with which you can be confident of success.

(ETA: @Threads, you're cheating: those tests are a JSP vs. FMJ. Of course the .45ACP looks pooky by comparison.)",,,,,,,,,,

I take exception to the idea that shotguns should be solely what are recommended.

CO Detectors,2675644,locked*n*loaded,"Sep 19, 2024 at 7:30 PM","The CO detectors are probably a combo with the smoke detectors. Not necessarily, but probably. In all likelihood they are probably wired into the electric. I don't know if you could block them off well enough or not. The entire detector, not just the vent inlets, would have to be blocked off. Whether you could do that with plastic and tape, I don't know. It would have to be perfect blocking off since you're dealing with a gas that can find its way through even the smallest of entry points of the plastic you're using to try and seal it. They're possibly hooked up to remote callers that call the fire department automatically in addition to some alert on the premises. I think you'd need better than Saran wrap.

Ctb plan outlined,2676053,hell toupee,"Sep 20, 2024 at 7:41 AM","I have the exact same pressures imploding in on me.

Mentally I'm dealing with finding my wife, my best friend, dangling by an extension cord in my bedroom just about 5 weeks ago.

Worse yet, last January I started to lose my balance and fall so I became wheelchair bound. My fingers also began to curl inwards, contractures, making difficult to use my hands and do almost anything.

I can deal with being in a wheelchair, but losing the use of my hands is a real game changer. Imagine not being able to twist a doorknob, or zip up your pants, or twist open a water bottle, or tie your shoes, or be forced to use a cellphone for everything but having to type with your thumb (I can still use my thumbs somewhat normally) but I can't hold and use a mouse so no computer. I'll never play the drums or guitar again, something I spent a lifetime doing.

After my wife died, I went in to the hospital to try and figure out what was wrong with me and while there I don't have a single soul in the world I could call for help, as it was just me and my wife against the world, my business, which I spent 22 years building by myself, completely crashed to the ground as I wasn't there to tend to clients and besides, my wife was my caretaker and was driving me in to work once I got in the wheelchair, so I can't drive and have no way to get there.

So in the span of a month I lost my wife, my caretaker, my business, and my ability to earn a living ever again. Plus I can barely do anything on my own with my hands the way they are

I have all those pressures and am faced with trying to survive on disability in San Diego where a studio goes for $2k/mo, meaning it's not going to happen.

I have extensive nerve damage in my fingers and my toes and I was told it's irreversible, they don't know why. I will never get better.

I have about $5000 to my name and once that runs out I'm toast.

Regardless, even if I could somehow figure something out with a $1200/mo disability payment, living in someone's shed or something, what kind of life can I have being crippled and not being able to do anything but watch TV all day? Which I hate TV in the first place and have never been a TV watcher.

I just wish I had a reliable way to CTB, so I envy you.

least painful methods - is SN actually painless ?
hello all, Looking to get outta here pretty soon, is SN currently the most ""peaceful""? Wondering how much discomfort there actually is with this drug. Ideally we'd still have access to N, but as per my understanding it's not really feasible to purchase online. I'd maybe be willing to travel for...

,2675023,SVEN,"Sep 19, 2024 at 7:54 AM","Seems very unlikely to me. Quite apart from the willpower required to inflict such ongoing pain over a period of time, you're going to find that the loss of blood will be fairly low (in comparison to the total amount in your system) and will tend to coagulate as you go along. Even hitting veins is no assurance of success, whilst arteries such as the Femoral or common Carotid are relatively deep and protected by muscle.

I first had thoughts of wanting to die when I was 7, I still remember it all clearly, followed by my first inpatient stay when I was 11 and that was also when I was first put on a psych med: Prozac. Since then, it's been 32 years of a multitude of medications and hospital stays. Suicide attempts and a multitude of scars on my arms and legs from when I s/h in high school. There was a period between 2017 and 2022 where I had no worries about winding up in the hospital but I had something to stuck around for: my soulcat Paddy. He showed up in my life when I needed him the most, during one of the darkest periods ever for me. A close friend of mine had od'd on Valentine's Day 2017 and on March 16, he jumped onto my lap. But then on December 29, 2022, Paddy passed away while I rocked him in my arms and sang to him. When your purpose for living is gone, what then? When your body has rebelled against you for decades, what then? I'm tired of surgeries. I'm tired of pills. I'm tired of family and apartment management scolding me for not having an immaculate apartment because I'm too exhausted and in pain to keep an immaculate apartment...(but I'm too young and not sick enough to qualify for an aide). I'm just so tired. I want an exit bag because for once I just want something where there's no more pain. I'm tired of the masks and the lies of ""I'm okay. I'm fine. I'm having a good day"" because telling the truth leads to conversations you don't want to have or it irritates people because they don't understand why you aren't better yet. I'm tired of missing all of my friends that have passed away since I was a little kid. I've jokingly called myself a professional widow because I'm constantly losing friends and boyfriends.

Yes, suicide may not be the very optimal version, but is so far the answer I could come up with.

Over the years of combatting the mental situation I've tried therapies and meds along with all kinds of stuff and that's becoming physically and financially overwhelming. It's simply pointless to spend the rest of my life doing an exhaustive search for a cure. I mean there might be a better version than ctb but I'm just too worn out to seek it.

I'm barely socially functional due to many things, such as my schedule and mentality being a complete mess for many years. Even if I may come into contact with other ppl they're highly unlikely gonna do anything positively to me even they desire to: Those who aren't going through mental diversion will simply not relate to what I'm going through; whilst those who are going through or have survived any M.D.s are simply too powerless or disabled to care.



Plus, social life just won't run properly if I don't mask myself, let alone while I try to find a cure from others. And even if I manage to pose as normal for a while to meet ppl, the veil would finally fall due to how much cognitive resources it would require me. So overtime I in fact learnt the fact that I should and could only be socially dysfunctional, instead of just randomly and negatively assuming so.

""You matter!""

This is sth. I find myself to agree with sometimes, yet it seems to vague how I could actually matter. ppl matter in this way or the other and, to me, they matter bc they have various things to chase after, and they have different desires and dreams. That's what makes people matter in distinct ways.

As of me, I've been stuck in limbo long enough and now all my desires draw themselves to ending my pain, and I can't think of anything other than death that could do the work. It's not a competition but say, five years of bpd and anxiety, highly treatment resistant, various traumatic events, these are not anything one can just walk off or triviality find any solution to. I've bet all my chips on recovery yet it could only sustain a low QoL for me, like, no intention to insult, the unconscious terminal ills living off life sustaining machines. Do I ""matter"" in this way? no.

I matter in the way I pursue my dream to end my pain, and that naturally justifies my choice of taking my own life.",,,,,,,,,,

I guess the obvious thing to suggest would be to try and pause and think before you say something. If it's hurtful- why are you saying it? What is it you need? I don't know. I'm just trying to work out what I would do.

From what you've said, it sounds more to me like you're afraid that the people you need in your life may not like you as much as you like them. I think that's a common fear a lot of people have. Ultimately, I suppose it's fear of abandonment but again, I'm kind of guessing here.

How do i punish myself for being such an awful person?,2676320,-Link-,"Sep 20, 2024 at 12:34 PM","@coolgal82 -- you have an illness, and the behaviour you're describing is a manifestation of that illness.

There is a difference between the action (""accusing all my friends of secretly hating me,"" etc. -- whatever ""acting awful"" looks like) and the label (""I'm an awful person""). One does not necessarily predicate the other, and I'd argue that this applies especially here because if you were truly an awful person, you wouldn't be experiencing all this guilt and feeling the need to punish yourself for it.

It's OK to reach out to them, walk it back if you have to, apologize, offer to make amends (or ask them what you can do to make it up to them), tell them you'll make a genuine effort going forward (without making any promises), and if it makes sense to do so, tell them how they can help you or how they can best respond/react to you if/when a situation happens again in the future.",,,,,,,,,,

How do i punish myself for being such an awful person?,2676459,-Link-,"Sep 20, 2024 at 3:30 PM","I'm really sorry you're in so much pain with this. It's palpable... I can feel it coming through in your words.

It's OK to attribute problematic behaviours to your illness (this is just the ""why it's happening"" of the situation) while also taking responsibility for it (this is the full-on apology including an acknowledgement of the behaviour and offering amends and effort towards doing better going forward).

Have you ever been to therapy for this or had a diagnosis or done your own research that identifies a potential diagnosis? It would help narrow down how to best approach this as far as trying to regain more self-control.

^ Professional therapy of course could be an option. I've heard people have some success with ChatGPT. And there are a lot of mental health conditions that have self-guided courses online as far as adopting coping mechanisms and training/conditioning your brain to better handle them (eg. catching itself before an outburst happens).

Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT) comes to mind as having potential to help address the behaviours you're describing. DBT goes towards regaining control of your emotions (reducing their intensity, coping mechanisms for handling distress), grounding yourself in the moment (aka meditation or mindfulness, co-existing with your thoughts rather than dwelling on them, experiencing your feelings without judging them), and techniques for maintaining healthier interpersonal relationships (reducing volatility in relationships, ways to handle and cope with conflict).

If this doesn't sound appealing, then perhaps you could look at it as... a punishment...? (I'm kind of hesitant to frame any type of therapy as a punishment, but, I mean, ""whatever it takes..."")

For the part of your friends: They know you're ill, and they know this leads to outbursts on occasion. Yes, you are responsible for your own behaviour. However, on the other side of this, your friends are responsible for establishing their own boundaries as far as what behaviour they are able and willing to tolerate or withstand. It's up to them to balance your behaviours with those boundaries and then reconcile with whatever that (im)balance looks like, and then communicate what they need from you (if anything) in moving forward.

Another way you can look at this: What if it was one of your friends exhibiting this behaviour? Would you condemn them and want to cut them out of your life? Or would you have an understanding and try to make allowances for them, even if it's challenging to withstand at times? If they owned up to their behaviour and pledged to try to do better, would you reject them, or would you be more inclined to forgive them and ask how you can help?

Lastly, you tell yourself you're ""avoiding responsibility..."" I don't know about that. Everything you're telling us here, the need to punish yourself, the guilt coming across in your words to a point where I can literally feel some of your pain... This really isn't reading to me as ""avoiding responsibility."" It's more like you're saying, ""I am responsible. What can I do about this?"" ...which is one of the most responsible things somebody in your position can do.",2676400,2676316,,,,,,,,

Im not at the point where i have a plan rn, but i have attempted during a dissociative episode once and im honestly just praying that another one gets me and finishes the job this time. 23 years was plenty, more than plenty. I feel like ive been in a post credit scene for the past 8 years and the whole thing is so surreal. Its such a bizarre way to live, nothing feels real. Most of the time its not even that i want to die (although i definitely do at this moment) its just that the idea of living for another 8 years sounds horrible and more so impossible. I struggle to even accept the reality that odds are im gonna be alive next week let alone when im 31.

Is anyone else in a similar situation? how do you deal with it? As much as im hoping i just end up getting sent into an episode and finish the job i need to accept that that is something i cant really predict. How do you cope with feeling like your life will end very soon and the derealization that comes with it? How do you plan for a future you dont think will come?",,,,,,,,,,

When I was in highschool I was convinced I wouldn't make it to 20. In-between I've had various side quests and efforts to find or distract myself.

I have a good amount of debt, because I'm still convinced I'll leave by my choice before they get it back. (Who's laughing now?!)

It's hard for me to carry through on big commitments. I went to art school, but dropped out shortly before getting my BFA (after doing my thesis, ironically).

I'm just coasting through life in many ways. At this point of my life I feel bound to be here, due to the people in my life. It's hard that the more time we spend here the more we get entangled in relationships and commitments that make leaving when we want difficult. Still, I'm preparing for the time of leaving at the time of my choosing.",,,,,,,,,,

I have been just going on autopilot for now but this just isn't life. I don't know how to deal if i live more. I just waiting until it becomes unbearable enough or better out of nowhere, maybe?

Being alive has been horrible and even though I was getting better last months, something terrible was done to me not long ago and I just can't keep fighting. I don't want to find the will to live and then lose it again with the next horrible thing that will be done to me.

And I know people will blame me, instead of asking what terrible things have happened to me in order for me to find suicide as my only hope, instead of asking who could do such a thing to a pregnant person. They'll find fault in me and not in the people who have hurt me this much. I will once more pay with my body for their behaviour, pay with my life when they just keep living happily, never facing consequences. But at least I'll finally have peace (I hope).

I'm done.",,,,,,,,,,

Just started my regiment,2652382,Themogger,"Aug 31, 2024 at 3:39 AM","Took my first meto pill this morning at 8, right after eating some delicious fried rice my roommate made . I know I know, I should be in fasting mode. So I'm not gonna eat or drink anything for the rest of today and tomorrow (if I don't get a chance today).

I need certainty that my roommate is asleep or will be gone for more than an hour so I'll just keep taking meto every 8 hrs until I get the chance.

Here's my stat regiment when the conditions are met;
Painkillers -Two paracetamol pills(500mg each totaling 1000mg)

Final meto- 3× 10mg pills to be taken 20 minutes after the painkillers

Prepare SN mixture and backup mixture with my baking measuring spoons.
1tablespoon = 15g
1teaspoon = 5g
So first mix is 1 table spoon and 2 teaspoons = 25g
Second/backup mix is 2 tablespoons = 30g
Body weight is 86kg(I think, different readings at different pharmacies ) but it's under 100kg so 25g SN is ideal. Amount of water is 62ml (some baking measuring cups came with the spoons )

Ingesting SN- To be done 40min after taking the meto pills. Fruit and peppermint flavored mentos prepared for salty taste. Vomit bag also by my bedside so I don't have to vomit in a toilet.

I took precautions to label the SN cups and vomit bag (do not wash or reuse. Carefully dispose. Possible toxic hazard). I'll also be going through the trouble of disposing the unused SN and it's container during the 40min window of preparation(from taking 3 meto pills to ingesting 1st cup). Not sure why, but I just want to.

Okay, I think that's it. Any input will be appreciated. I probably won't be posting a goodbye thread so this is it. Might leave a comment to indicate when I finally ingest the first SN mix. I'll be in the chats or on YouTube for the rest of the weekend

Bye bye",,,,,,,,,,

MAID in Canada??,2676220,-Link-,"Sep 20, 2024 at 10:46 AM","Some people in years past have had assisted dying for mental illness, but only because (I suppose) the legislation at the time was subject to interpretation. But that's not a happening thing right now because Canada's legislation currently specifically excludes mental illness.

MAID is scheduled to officially expand to the mentally ill in March 2027, but next year is an election year in which we're likely going to see a Conservative government take over from the current Liberals. The Conservative leader has specifically stated that if he's elected, he's going to put a stop to it altogether, so the March 2027 date doesn't really mean anything.

A constitutional challenge was recently filed in the province of Ontario, but I imagine it'll take a while before it makes its way up to our Supreme Court which, if they were to rule in our favour, would leave the government (of any party) no choice but to expand access to the mentally ill. Eventually.

I'd expect the likely-incoming Conservative government to fight it all the way to the bitter end, so it'll be the Supreme Court that makes the call.

Regardless, following what @EvisceratedJester said, I've never heard any talk at any point of opening up assisted dying services to foreign visitors. Canada will not become another option to Switzerland.",,,,,,,,,,

I have no idea describe this and Im hoping someone here also gets it.,2662521,sadidiot0328,"Sep 8, 2024 at 8:45 AM","Does anyone else avoid social interactions or balance them in a way its not so often? Im afraid Im saying something that upsets people or saying something wrong and making the few friends I have upset with me. The same happens on a day to day basis. The whole day Im worried I am going to anger someone or do something wrong or something WILL go wrong. It eats me up and I usually distract myself to ignore the feeling.

Another recent thing Ive dealt with is the constant thought of something disturbing or awful. Sometimes a graphic or simply gross thought will appear in my head and get more and more intense with little things that remind me of it until it disappears one day. Then itll appear in waves from then on. THEN I'll have an issue where I just need to double-check something. Even if im 100% positive I did it, Ill completely forget and itll eat at me until I check again. and again. and again.

Please, does anyone know a name for this kind of thing? I searched it up and google and other people online say its OCD but I havent been diagonsed with that and I dont think I have it. I dont know how to get rid of these feelings. i attached a drawing that explains somewhat",,,,,,,,,,
I have no idea describe this and Im hoping someone here also gets it.,2662544,laetitia7,"Sep 8, 2024 at 9:09 AM","hi! i'm going through this. i am diagnosed bipolar type 2, autistic, anxiety. i do not have a diagnosis of borderline or OCD, but i have the same symptoms you're having that are characteristic of anxiety. these are symptoms of fear of rejection and intrusive thoughts. a month ago i started suffering intrusive thoughts for the first time in my life (i am 21yo and treat mental health since i was 11) that were linked to my anxiety disorder

i can assure you you're experiencing anxiety-based symptoms, and untreated anxiety can lead to a depressive state.

my intrusive thoughts got better after a month taking my anxiety meds again (i had stopped). they consisted of fear of killing someone and running away while driving, fear of doing a terrible, terrible thing to my pets, to pets i treat at the veterinary hospital i worked, fear of committing zoophilia, pedophilia, theft, agression. disturbing images popped into my head, related to traumas, things i've never done etc etc.

keep this in mind: for any diagnosis to be valid, you don't need to just attend the diagnostic criteria. there is a severity and impairment criteria related. i would suggest, if you're capable, to search a psychiatrist. they can help identify anxiety related issues and medicate you to prevent crisis and treat your symptoms.

Most likely, this would be symptomatic of an anxiety disorder. There would be a few possibilities, with OCD being one of them. Also as @soobirang pointed out, it doesn't have to be full-blown OCD. Many people experience traits without fitting an actual diagnosis.

You say you haven't been diagnosed with OCD, so I am guessing that you have. There is also OCPD which is often not so easy as OCD to identify and you can have anxiety or other things like ADHD along with it. It can be rather complicated at times. A therapist is the only one who can give you an answer. If your not getting one, then ask them to explain your symptoms and why you feel the way you do. I've done this many times. For example there are often times when I feel like I have BPD but my therapist has explained to me that it is just my reaction to extreme stress and anxiety.",,,,,,,,,,

That being said what you're going through is normal in anxiety based symptoms or disorders. This ain't just in OCD, it can be Schizophrenia, Depression, Anxiety, Autism, and even ADHD but even then you don't need a mental disorder to have them, just to be anxious enough.

These thoughts do not define you. They are called intrusive thoughts for a reason. Usually they're Anxieties or fears we have manifest. A lot of victims of CSA may end up having graphic pedophilic thoughts because they're afraid of becoming one or passing down that hurt. Some abuse survivors brains they to convince them that they're abusive. And even suicidal brains will try and pick out every small detail to make you read into everything too much to stress you out.

I am saying this because I get some absolutely heinous thoughts.

Try this:
Remember: What your brain tells you doesn't define you– how you react to these thoughts does. If you're having a thought about killing a cat and you hate it, then you're not a cat killer.

Try and discern the reason/origin. Is is the fear of becoming that thing? Is it cause of trauma?

Distractions!

Sometimes I can sorta feel am awful thought coming along when I look at something, so I look away. It's a visual trigger in that case.

Sometimes I get really noisy music or even just loud or distracting sounds off ASMR videos (heavy on distracting, you dont have to enjoy it, it's supposed to interupt that thought) to stop them from leaking in until I'm in a better mood. Or if you have an active imagination just think abt the music your listening to.

Watch a stupid video or movie on a random topic

I also Sometimes interrupt said thoughts by simply getting so annoyed at them or just going ""no""

This is just what works for me. I hope you find something that works for you

My parents won't give me my inheritance to pay for euthanasia at Dignitas,2676144,Alexandra0,"Sep 20, 2024 at 9:24 AM","The situation is really sad..
Last fall, when I first mentioned euthanasia to my parents, after much persuasion, they first agreed to give me my inheritance to pay for my DREAM, but then refused. I'm not surprised, but very, very upset, because they've been doing this all their lives: first they give hope, then they take it away. By the way, I live separately. I hate them, I just hate them, for such mockery of a living person. In particular, I hate my mother for giving birth to me. They see how bad I feel, but they just don't care, they understand perfectly well that my despair has reached its peak. By then, I had already found myself a translator, found a bank where I could make a SWIFT transfer. I looked at ticket prices on Aviasales. I looked for information on the Internet about the terms and price for a Schengen visa, for restoring a foreign passport, in a word, I was preparing. I had hope. And they took it away from me. I already sent my application to Dignitas, they sent me all the necessary documents and an invoice, assigned me a membership number.
My mother says that I will receive an inheritance after her death, obviously I can't wait another 30 years or so

I'm almost 30, I've suffered enough and I'm fed up with this ""life"". I've been dreaming of dying my whole fucking life, I have more than good reasons. I'm tormented by my physical illness, which will never be cured, it brings me unbearable, daily suffering. Mentally, I've always felt bad, too, because I'm not happy with my appearance. There are other things too

Universe, please give me what I want on my fucking birthday, which is in a few days. On this day it all began and let it all end on this day. After all, this is my only dream, I don't ask for anything else. I can no longer stay in this inky black, impenetrable, suffocating darkness that squeezes me from all sides.

"Abuse, Bullying and Trauma Megathread",1451269,TheHatedOne,"Jan 6, 2022 at 8:29 AM","I fucking hate it when I involuntarily remember the bullying moments I had in school. It hits me from nowhere, and then I get petrified, with my heart starting to beat faster and having a mini mental breakdown.

I was bullied daily in middle school. I'd always have nasty remarks thrown at, and me being the hypersensitive person that I am I'd always be affected. No matter how much I tried to shrug it off, at home I would always cry because of this. It didn't help that I was the most shy, most ugly and poorest person in the classroom.

The bullying would sometimes get physical. I'd have things thrown at me, and the harassment... I remember a guy touching my back where my bra was and pulling it.

And then I had someone who manipulated me and threatened me throughout all these years, thinking that she was my friend. But we drifted apart after I had enough of her shit and got into a physical fight. After that she slowly turned tothe side of the classroom's shallow bitches and when we'd speak she'd just threaten me and name call me.

When I was in 7th grade, I begged my parents to move me to another school, but they were like ""nOoO AFE, u HaVe OnE yEaR lEfT wHy Do It At ThE eNd? SuFfEr FoR oNe MoRe YeAr""

Among the worst was the bullying because I couldn't do Maths at all, not even basic one. I'm terrified of anything Maths or Physics related. As I type this I feel like crying.

Moving to high school, I wasn't as bullied as in middle school. But, I'd still have nasty remarks thrown at sometimes. And I was called ugly once right at the beginning of the first year lol. I was once being teased repeatedly and I told the classmate to stop it politely twice. The third time I lost my temper and I screamed.

In 11th grade when someone moved into the classroom I had the worst bullying days in high school. This newcomer particularly hated on me and terrified me for days. One day, when he kept throwing stuff at me I lost it and started to cry in classroom to which some classmates told him to stop.

Then, in 12th grade, these words still freshly ring in my mind sometimes, the words of a girl I was on good terms with at the beginning, but then she changed into an insufferable shallow bitch that everyone worshipped. She took away the two guys I was on amicable terms with, one of these guys I had crush on in 10th grade when he moved in this classroom. I was in chemistry class sitting at my desk when she and this guy I told about come in and asked her if it's okay if he can sit with me, I'm mentioning we've been deskmates since 11th grade, to which she said ""Stay with me, who the fuck would sit with her?"".

Yeah, no one would, ever. I'm not worthy of anything. Just suffering and bullying. That's all.


I wasn't bullied only in real life, but also online. I was bullied by two French guys in the game which used to be my favorite to the point that they stole my in game identity.


I realize that what I've been through is little compared to what many of you went through, but it still really affected me and shaped the worldviews that I have nowadays. At this point, I'm just a collection of traumas and consequences of the abuse and bullying I received. Nothing more.

I doubt anyone will read this, but eh.

I feel like curling up into a ball and die.",,,,,,,,,,
"Abuse, Bullying and Trauma Megathread",1451282,RainAndSadness,"Jan 6, 2022 at 8:52 AM","Thanks for this thread. I was strongly neglected by my parents during my entire chilhood and I've been severely bullied in school on top of that for several years. I've never had friends or any kind of support. I've felt so incredibly alone and hopeless during that time, it's why I wanted to end my life back when I was 14 years old. It was the only way out of this misery and to this day, I wish I had suceeded in my plan to commit suicide. Sadly, I didn't and the events that happened in my childhood have caused severe trauma, which I still relieve in my nightmares every single night, which is one of the reasons why I'm suffering so much. I'm dealing with the consequences of my past to this day and even when I sleep, I don't get a break from any of this. So I'm basically emotionally exhausted 24/7. When I wake up, I'm exhausted because of my nightmares which make me relieve the worst moments of my life and when I go to sleep, I'm exhausted because of my existential dread and all the suffering I'm exposed to every single day. There is no way out. As a result of all these experiences I've developed major depressive disorder and dysthymia, also known as persistent depression disorder (yeah that's double depression for me, isn't that nice), social anxiety, BPD and much more. I think to this day I didn't get all of my conditions diagnosed properly, which is probably one of the reasons why there is no proper treatment. And the combination of all these disorders make it basically impossible to treat them appropiately anyway. It's not just as simple as ""oh you're depressed, take this pill and you're good"", it's way more complicated than that because all of my conditions interact with each other and each one of them add additional layers of mental and emotional pain on my life. I'm confident my long list of mental health conditions are a result of my childhood trauma and they turn every single day into a crazy rollercoaster of emotions. It's unbearable. There isn't any treatment that works for me and it's why I think a final and permanent way out of my suffering is a valid option in my case and I think it's a representative example of mental health conditions that justify someones desire to end their life. What's the alternative? More suffering for the next few decades? No thanks. I'm 27 years and I already feel twice as old due to my suffering. When you have chronic issues, you get sick and tired of life. The longer I live, the more I see myself turning into this bitter, empty asshole that's just cynical about everything. My entire life has been a series of traumatic experiences and I think I have every right to say ""this is where it ends"".

So yeah, that's one part of my story. I think this turned into incoherent rambling but I hope my experience adds something to this thread.",,,,,,,,,,

Random memories from teenagerhood:

11 or 12 years old:
- burning pictures of my childhood: I don't have a single picture I got rid of all of them to forget everything and burry my feelings
between 11 and 15 years old:
- memory loss
15-18 years old:
- Watching my parents act very immature and fight all the time. Watching all the abuse, the screaming, ...etc, putting up with poverty issues, ...etc
- being asked to get out of the house and live somewhere else because I wanted to sleep till 11 am (it was a weekend)
- dealing with sarcasm because I'm too tired to do anything. Normal kids would be happy doing so and so!
- more of the above

Random memories from early adulthood (18-24 years old)

- getting my driver license ASAP to leave the house more often
- isolating myself and avoiding friendships in the university because the social activities available are too expensive for me!
- isolating myself and avoiding relationships with guys in the university because all guys are monsters and manipulative (stupid shit fed to me by family and relatives)
- reminding me every now and then that I'm taking space in the house
- constantly going to places to ""study"" because I don't feel comfortable staying home and wanted to avoid fights

I literally have zero social skills, I am too sensitive. I am weak and timid.

The endless trauma and abuse has made me suicidal.

"Abuse, Bullying and Trauma Megathread",1452048,neverendingstorey,"Jan 6, 2022 at 10:54 PM","The abuse happened when I was a child by a relative. When my family found out they were so angry with me. After that point, they were always mad at me. I was always in trouble and looked at as a nuisance.

My parents were so ready to get me put of the house. I was always working, always tired... always broke. Drinking gave me momentary relief from depression. I was able to work and get by.

Met a guy then and we have been together for close to two decades. He grew up in abusive household but it was different than mine. More intense. I am positive now that he was with me because I provided a way for him to get out of his family life and not necessarily because he loved me.

He says the worst things to me to break my heart on a daily basis. The most recent one was he called my perpetrator my boyfriend and said that I enjoyed it (I was 9). He is an extremely picky eater (only eats the same thing everyday) and yells and throws things if I don't do it the correct way. When I make different food he calls them science experiments, ya know, because everything I make tastes like shit.

The smallest thing will make him go into a rage. The way I use aluminum foil, where I put something away... things that aren't a big deal and don't matter. Instead of doing something the way they want it do be done in a couple of minutes, they yell at me like I'm a dumb child for an hour. The dog barks and it's my fault.

When they get mad I don't, yell, cuss or call names. How can I? I can't even get two words in anyway. But they are literally breaking things, yelling, name calling and saying the worst thing that pops into their head.

He wasn't always this bad. I've tried to be understanding of his past but I am miserable. I always get him gifts for birthdays and holidays and he never does anything. He'll say that I'm yelling when I am clearly not and make me repeat things or answer things back like a child. Wishes I was dead one day and then says he loves me the next.

With COVID everything is 24/7 and it's really rough. I've lost motivation and I feel like shit. The years of dirty looks, yelling and insults has made me really sad and defeated. I have been drinking to escape.",,,,,,,,,,

"Abuse, Bullying and Trauma Megathread",1452168,Chaestergram,"Jan 7, 2022 at 2:13 AM","TW : sexual abuse, sex work, sex trafficking, stalking, eating disorder, self harm and else

I had been abused multiple time, physically and mentally, I guess I had one experience of bullying.

When I was a kid, around 8, I was sexually abused by my first stepfather until I reached 13, told it to my best friend at that time that contacted the child protection service. The only somehow ""good"" thing that happened is that my stepfather didn't denied and confessed during the trial.

After that I got sexually assaulted 4 different time, one was when I was going out around 14, when I was 18 by my boyfriend at that time (which was a stalker and abusing me mentally, had reported to the cops but nothing happened since he was part of an ""organization"" that have influence on corrupt cops) he drugged me and thankfully my flatmate found him and made him leave, then when I think I was 19 I don't remember clearly as the two last time happened the same year but i was going home after partying, I passed out drunk in the taxi and the taxi driver took me to a forest at the complete opposite of my place and well abused me, in the middle of it I gain back consciousness and was able to escape and the last time, was a bit before my 20's birthday, with my ""pimp"" we were staying at one of the guy that would ""support me financially"", she left to club as I was sick that day and he abused me during my sleep.

For the last time it happened I had a really hard time to heal from it as this time I finally gain the courage to say stop and fight back but he was twice my size and weight and he dared to told me that he wasn't raping me so i should stop resisting and later on when I found the courage to say it to my ""pimp"", she told me that it was my own fault and this stayed stuck in my mind for so long.

When it comes to my ""pimp"", in other words I was sexually trafficked, it took me some times to finally gather the courage to leave as she stole my passport, was stealing all the money I made (I was living abroad at that time). She was also physically abusing me, when we were going out to clubs she would humiliate me by spitting on me, taking off my wig in public, throwing her drinks at me, calling me a dog and so much more but also slapping me, scratching me.

One day I had enough and burst out of rage, we started fighting but unfortunately (to me or not cause i was ready to kill her) people passing by broke into the fight to stop us.

Once I went back to my country, her and a mutual friend tried to frame me, at that time I was still talking to this mutual friend thinking that I could trust her but turn out that she turned her back on me and was sharing everything I said. One day this bitch send screenshots to my parents that I was a sex worker and porn actress, thanks goodness that my family let me do whatever I want even if they don't approve, they didn't questioned me and just told me to go report everything to the cops which ofc they didn't do shit.

When it comes to the bullying, during my last year of middle school I decided to change school as all the people working there knew that I had been assaulted by my stepfather and I didn't felt anymore comfortable in that school so I went to another one and last a week there because I had put on Facebook that I missed my old school and everyone from that new school got it all twisted, thinking that I was saying shit about them so after the 2 days of me being popular in that school everyone decided to wrote a song about me « the red cow » (I had red hair and piercings all over my face at that time, so referencing to my septum), people were trying to snatch my back, push me and some girls even called their big brother to fight with me thinking that it would scared me but I was just responding back to everyone and was ready to fight whoever dared to mess with me but one day I totally exploded in front of the school and go completely berserk after my mom got to the principal to tell him everything and he dared to say right into my face that if those kids were bullying me it was my fault and not them nor the kids, so I just stopped going to that school.

And don't know which part it's supposed to fall under but I was receiving death threats online daily by unknown guys, so does also threats from miserable virgin that couldn't get no pussies, my phone number got linked on a revenge porn site by the ex that abused me and tons of other people that I never heard of would contact me and told me to be careful while giving me details of my life that they weren't supposed to know.

After all of this I went through a hikikomori phase, not going out of my room, not taking care of myself, the only time I was opening the door was to use the toilet and pick up the things I was telling my family to buy for me (alcohol, cigarettes and an excessive amount of snacks) I gained 30kg from not going out of my place for almost a year and at one point I was like « I can't stay like this forever » so I started to work on myself and heal from it, it was truly long and felt like forever, especially when it comes to the huge anxiety I had when going out, which now I still do have if I don't go out regurlarly but I was getting better, loose all the weight I gained, getting back my confidence, working on my alcohol addiction, everything was about my own well being and my goals, I was just so full of life, I take off everyone that wasn't a good impact in my life and just being me.

Until I met my actual partner but I had written a bit about it in a post so no need to repeat myself even if it wasn't even half of everything. (Mental abuse)

Then for the rest that has nothing to do with external people, I suffered from eating disorder from 5 years old till… good question, in some way still now but less than before, I was diagnosed with anorexia and bulimia, so all my life I always was on the extreme, loosing hella weight fast and gaining faster, to this day even if I'm a normal shape, like a thick just middle and never had any problem when it comes to attention from guys and even girls, like i definitely know that tons of people wants to slap tf out of me for it as in the past I joined multiple support groups about that and none of the girls were supporting of me because to them since I am popular among men and don't got any problem with getting their attention so does how I look was just triggering their own insecurities so they felt the need to reject me the way people reject them but to me I would never be good enough (physically) if I don't have the desire shape that I want even if I am fully aware that I'm actually good looking (no pretentious just obvious honesty)

Then recently, about a year ago I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder but I don't trust this diagnosis as it was at the emergency room after my second attempt of the year and the meds they put me on completely changed me and made me have actual crisis I never had before like never ever.

But then yea when it comes to diagnosed I was diagnosed those 3, anxiety (social too), severe depression and complex ptsd.

When it comes to self harm I had been doing it since I was 8, kept on doing it until 16 then stopped it until 19, from 19 till 20 and stop until last year so (22/23) and now back at it to calm myself during a crisis.

And I guess that's all, as I am still recovering slowly but surely my memories as I didn't had any memories before the age of 16.",,,,,,,,,,

"Abuse, Bullying and Trauma Megathread",1453799,nohopes,"Jan 8, 2022 at 7:24 PM","I have autism. Light level. Diagnosed early.

When I was diagnosed, I realized why many things happened to me. Many times I was ingenuous. And it's hard to me notice about another's intentions.

1.(Actual) abuses in my job.
My colleague left, then I'm alone with double work. They don't want to hire another person to gain more profit.
So, I'm suffering with pressure. I'm not taking lunch because it has a lot of work to do and they want it fast. Everyday I work more than 15 hours per day. Sleeping less than 5 hours per day.
Last week, I was sick with 40 degrees of fever and kidney infection(both gained by excessive stress). I begged for my employers that I need to rest because I'm not good. They said ""you have to finish this project first."" I replied: ""so, I can't be sick and act like a machine that never fails, right?"" They replied: ""yeah, you can't be sick and you have to finish this job"".

Probably you going to ask: ""why you don't quit this job?""

I can't. Unfortunately I live in Brazil(that explains my shifty english)and the economics crysis is fucked up. Unemployment rate is high here. It's hard to find a job and I need to work to maintain and give at least basic conditions for my son(at least, because time for him I don't have anymore, I always stressed and I end yelling at him and feel horrible for this.

Plus, I have debts with them. I can't quit until I finish those debts.

Because of this actual shit, my wife wants to give up and I understand it.

That motivates to end my life.

2. Sexual abuse:

First sexual abuse, I was 6. The abuser was an close friend of my parents.

You know? Abusers gain trust and confidence of parents first, then attack the child. Here's a tip for you guys who have a son or daughter. Keep the eyes open. Sometimes(or always) you have to suspect the unsuspicious.

It didn't happened penetration or something like that. But dirty talks and weird touching in my body. And of course ""keep it secret or you will get consequences"".

The worse is, I noticed ""recently"" about how this abuse affected me early and explains why I have a lot of mental and trust issues.

Second: I was 16, in the night club.

A context here: I have a androgynous and young appearance and physic until today(actually I'm almost 30, but people always say I look having 15yr). Some others (mainly at my job) they make joke and fun of me calling me as ""little girl"" and ""faggot"" because of my appearance and manners that is different from them(being a fucking mascule that's carry a lot of weight, eat a lot, go to the brothels even married and fuck hygiene basics, like shit outside the vase and don't flushing their mess).

So, continuing, that night an gross old man was disturbing me, offering drinks, drugs and saying that he is a talent hunter, blablabla. I refused everything. But somehow, he put something in my drink while I was distracted. I went blank and soon I woke up in an motel room and the rest... I don't want to give details.

Third: at college, 20yrs.

Some think this is a joke or I was lucky. A lot of guys say I was lucky and I'm acting ungrateful.

I'm demisexual, so... I need to know, gain trust, and like the personality to begin feel attracted. Appearance doesn't matter to me and sex by first date doesn't work for me.

It was in the party. I was way more drunk.

Then a girl decided to take advantage and locked me in in a restroom with her.

I was sad, because a girl that I liked knew about this by the colleagues and I felt I lost total chances to be with her.

Third: I was not the victim, but it affected me a lot.

My ex-girlfriend was raped by her teacher. He was threatening her to make sex with him if she wants to pass the exams to her and be approved. (which he never gave results about the exams and it was hard to know how we're going).

She felt guilty and got away from me. I tried to comfort her and I know that it's not her fault. But no success.

I was in rage. I destroyed the teacher's car in a midnight.

3. Bullying.

That was a lot at my school like. The reasons are the same that I mentioned before. Appearance, ingenuity and making fun of it. I used to be the isolated one in the classes.",,,,,,,,,,

ENG: Hello to all dear forum users.

I have a lot of respect for the creators of this forum and its community and I hope you understand and agree with the relevance of creating this thread.
This thread is more like a little Russian Chat. Nothing special.


Yesterday I created a thread about my planned CTB, where I mentioned that I am from Russia. Several users from Russia joined the discussion, so we started communicating in Russian, which became uncomfortable for the rest of the community. As a result, we just started translating our messages into English in addition to the original Russian.

I wrote this thread to create a place for Russian-speaking users to ask any questions or share anything in their native language. That is, the main language will be Russian, but anyone will be able to answer or read using a translator if they wish.
This doesn't seem to be such a serious violation of the rules, I hope the administration will let me create this thread.

Feel free to ask anything in English, I'm sure most of the Russian users speak good English. But I assume that initially the conversation will be aimed at the Russian audience without translation into English.",,,,,,,,,,

На сколько я понял - всё зависит от чистоты SN. Это может быть микс, например доступная на тех же маркетплейсах Нитритовая соль, которую используют для готовки. В ней содержание Нитрита Натрия ~0.5%, что конечно не летально.
Но при должной дозировке чистого SN (точную дозировку можно найти в соответствующих темах) летальный исход более чем вероятен.

Что происходит после того, как ты выпил разведенный SN? Ну, пьётся оно легко. На вкус как аквариумная вода, слегка солёная. Тебя может тошнить, а самое главное - ты начнёшь ощущать сильную нехватку воздуха, тебе будет тяжело дышать. Как быстро ты потеряешь сознание - точно не знаю, вроде бы это опционально.

Я могу ошибаться, так как мнения правда разнятся.

У меня под это отдельный тред, но кратко - я решил попробовать OD с героином. Учитывая отсутствие толерантности шанс выжить минимален. Из плюсов: ты потеряешь сознание почти моментально, не успев почувствовать любое недомогание. Плюс это наркотик, опиоид, поэтому мысли будут строиться легче и совершенно по другому (но ты толком и не успеешь подумать). Единственный минус: нужно какое-то время, чтобы организм прекратил свою работу. Это не моментально, может занять от получаса до нескольких, а то и десятка часов.
Всё это зависит от чистоты героина. Единственный вариант: Дарк нет шопы. А вот наверняка знать заранее какая чистота у героина - ты не можешь, кроме как проведя собственные тесты и анализы. Но сейчас вижу, что подобные способы начинают все больше замечать и выдвигать вперёд, вместо SN

Ну и конечно есть риск быть принятым полицией + героин стоит денег. Все рекомендуют 1.5 грамма внутривенно, а это довольно дорого.",2175875,,,,,,,,,

Human suffering truly has no limits, and it's cruel to expect someone to continue to stay happy when they are suffering.

Sometimes death is the only way out of a bad situation, but to ignore that means we receive no help to end our lives.

You can try. The sellers overseas will warn you but will still post it.

Perhaps calling border forces was what triggered your incident. I can't speak to your personal experiences, all of that may well have happened to you. It didn't happen to me & you definitely don't get to speak to mine. Perhaps if you wanted to be helpful to other Australians you could share who your source was as that could also be your issue.
But although hard to source, SN is not illegal in Australia. I know that multiple OS sellers send to Australia regularly, without a single hiccup. Suppliers that lie on the package. Suppliers that tell the truth. It's not illegal. I was completely terrified of customs, of welfare checks, absolutely terrified.

There are others but my only personal experience is with DMC.
Again, just not true. I feel bad if this has been your genuine experience. Again, I can't know your circumstances. But if you're legitimate, please share who you purchased from & what triggered the welfare check etc. I absolutely despise the idea that people may have read your post as fact - the ""do not ship SN into Australia from anywhere!!!"" bit is wrong & not up for debate. Any Aussies out there that read this & still want SN, reach out to other Aussie's who had success - I used DMC, but reach out to others & find who they used.

I have everything ready to go. SN, proper AEs, benzos, etc. Had honestly a lovely life, filled with wonderful people, but a series of psychiatric hospitalizations and debilitating medications have taken the fight out of me. I've tried a lot of things to get better. I'm truly ready to go.

I've read most of the threads of people who've taken SN and been rescued, and the comprehensive thread of successful/unsuccessful attempts.

I am also completely terrified about this. But I also think there are some pro-life scaremongers out there with some propaganda. Plus people attempting without having done their homework. Or on impulse. I HAVE TO BELIEVE THIS or I will never CTB. I keep reminding myself that tachycardia & panic attacks feel the same & to be prepared for that. That a fast heart rate isn't the same as wanting to live. And that if I really want this, & I have to suffer, I will. It won't be for long, especially considering the pain that lays ahead of me healthwise anyway. I think N or whatever is the dream but most of us here either can't get or are too scared to break law etc. The only possibly helpful thing I can say, as someone who hasn't attempted, is that SN was being used as a humane way to kill feral pigs. It was so humane that it got people's heads thinking it'd be a great way to CTB. So, I'll leave you with a quote & I KNOW it's not going to replicate our experience, but it might be a comforting thought in the back of your mind, considering that SN is used in PPH & the first word is ""peaceful"" & this, about the pigs - ""They take a mouth full or two of bait and say, 'Oh that's making me feel a bit woozy', walk away to sort of snooze it off, and while they're sleeping it off, they just go into a deeper and deeper slumber and die,"" Dr Staples said.

of anything bad after a certain point, that the benzos will do their job. I have experience with an episode of severe tachycardia & even while hooked up to heart monitors with proof that it was physical, my brain was still convinced it was an anxiety attack. Which seems to be the opposite of most people - convinced they're having a heart attack when it's ""just"" a panic attack. But I'm so used to living with anxiety that I couldn't differentiate. Heart thumping equals anxiety. I couldn't override that feeling / thought.
I can't take beta blockers & am scared that I'll equate the tachy with SI, but think I'll have to keep repeating it to myself that it's ""just"" tachy & have faith that no matter what negative talk is here about SN, we can really never know someone else's experience or truth, but the PPH wouldn't endorse it if it wasn't peaceful.",2674715,,,,,,,,,

We're talking hypobaric chambers (hypoxic hypoxia), simulated hypobaric chambers (increased nitrogen, displacing oxygen, hypoxic hypoxia), getting drunk (histotoxic hypoxia), trauma patients (hypemic hypoxia), g-force (static/g-lock hypoxia), and I've had SN patients. I feel bad that I've done my job when I had SN patients. Emergency scenario and no one in the room knows what's going on, I see the veins, I see the skin, I see the vitals, and I'm like doc we need methylene blue stat, methemoglobinemia, don't ask me how I know. And then I'm like fuck why did I do that. It's just the training, see something say something.

I'm pretty confident that at worst SN is like getting too drunk and having Szechwan hot pot (the spicy spicy broth that numbs your tongue and isn't on the menu unless you order it in mandarin).

Tachy is terrifying to some people - I am one of those people. I'd imagine most people here haven't experienced it (just a guess) & that might contribute to the amount of people that call for help - confusing a physiological reaction with a rational thought. Again, just a guess. I have a million different illnesses with a million different meds with a million different side effects - at this point, it's just take the ones that keep you moving & disregard the ones that do more harm than good. As @Plato'sCaveDweller said, stat dose is quoted as being equally effective as 48 hour, so that may be a better fit for you & your circumstances. Getting a hold of the large amount of benzos recommended might be difficult but they hit really hard when people aren't used to them, & hit even harder when crushed - if there's a chance you could get a small prescription for an imaginary one-off highly stressful event or if you can get one or 2 here & there from people you know with legitimate access, that might be enough to ease the fear. I really don't have any advice on how to get benzos or overcome fear or anything really, I'm in the same boat (bus) but my boat (bus) has benzos in it.

A mixture of 11.5 g of NaNO2 and 9 g of NH4Cl dissolved in water should produce up to 4 liters of N2 at room temperature. Did anyone try to use this method?",,,,,,,,,,
Euthanasia - the easy way out?,2674483,scubadam,"Sep 18, 2024 at 4:45 PM","Hey,
Some time ago i wrote a discursive essay for a class, I decided on the topic of euthanasia. By the sheer fact that i'm on this site you can guess what is my opinion on this topic, but I had to come up with some contrarguments for the sake of my classwork - which was a pretty fun task to do (as for training my creative writing). I could go about it for hours, but I had a limited amount of time and words. I'm curious what do you guys think about my work; if criticizing, please do it in a constructive manner:)
Here is the text:

Euthanasia - the easy way out?

Euthanasia, or assisted suicide, has been a topic of discussion for a long time now. Some think, that the question ""Should euthanasia be legalized?"" has only two possible answers but forget that this problem is very complex. There are many arguments for and against it, few of which I will mention in this essay.

Firstly, everybody should have the right to decide about themselves, especially when treating a medical condition. If an owner of an animal can put it down when it gets too sick to live a comfortable life, why isn't it not possible for a willing individual to decide about ending their life too? However, it can be a slippery slope: some, especially the vulnerable people (such as the erderly or disabled), can feel pressured into making this decision. They can think of it as ""the easiest"" option avaliable, as to avoid being a burden or falling into a financial crisis. Moreover, there is always a chance of unforseen recovery.

Suicide - which euthanasia is basically about, is considered an abominable act in many cultures and religions; for example, both Christianity and Islam see it as a mortal sin, for which there can be no redemption. Also, it generates a moral burden for the medical staff; the doctors involved are supposed to save life, not end it.

Ironically, the right to have an assisted suicide can extend a patient's life. Knowing that they have an option of ending their suffering at any time, they don't have to reach for extreme means as commiting suicide in ways that can leave them in even worse state, before the condition gets too unbearable.

Euthanasia is a very complex and complicated issue, but it doesn't mean that we shouldn't tackle it. In my opinion, everybody should have the right to die with dignity and on their own terms.",,,,,,,,,,

I especially agree with (and have never understood) why people can kill pets left and right who are in pain - or in some cases are too old and are an inconvenience to the owner - but people can not kill themselves when in an incurable or excruciating state. Some conditions, especially ALS, have zero chance of survival, yet suicide is still a ""bad"" thing for those people. Totally illogical.",,,,,,,,,,

I actually really hate that phrase: 'The easy way out.' Like life is a challenge everyone has to participate in and will be rewarded for. If we don't want to play the game- why should we? Life is something that was forced on us by our parents and now, we're conscripted to follow a bunch of rich person's rules till we die, that basically seek to make them even richer.

Plus, something has to have a great deal of worth in order for someone to carry on following the difficult route. What's so bad about taking the easy route if you think the whole game is rigged and corrupt? Why would we even want to participate in such a system?

I think one main difference between suicidal and non suicidal people is that suicidal people often see less worth in life itself. Many of us are more secular so, it doesn't have that divine quality. Plus, we can be a cynical bunch. The rewards in life the 'normies' seem content to pursue- the dream partner, job, house, possessions may either not mean quite so much to us or, they simply feel totally out of reach or, not worth the effort they require.

I think the truth is- it upsets other people if we die. Then- they should say that then. Admit that you want to keep us hostage here suffering for your sake. Don't pretend it's something we'll necessarily be rewarded for if we grit our teeth and carry on with the challenge of life. We'll feel proud of ourselves that we didn't give in. We stuck it out to later be taken down by Alzeimers or cancer or something equally horrible! I really hate it when people project their ideas of life on us.

Still, I will concede that this may be the case for some people. They may actually be glad that they did stick it out. It won't be the case for all of us though. Plenty of members here wished they'd died years ago! Saved themselves some pain!",,,,,,,,,,

I have a stupid question,2675969,Neowise,"Sep 20, 2024 at 5:05 AM","Generally, you either die if your brain takes severe damage or your inner organs, causing you to bleed to death.

Landing on your belly causes your forehead to collide with the ground on impact (law of inertia) which will damage your brain. The same happens if you land on your back. That force could be great enough to kill you if the jumping height is high enough. Landing on your feet will wreck your legs and perhaps your spine, but it will cushion some of the impact and reduce the damage dealt to your ""important"" body parts.

Though, 120 meters sounds great and as @rozeske already mentioned and will most likely kill you in any case.",,,,,,,,,,

The package contents changes per parcel, those on here do never say the same and ones by me were not even merely related to OPs. The type of good package e.g sale of goods does change however it cannot be gone off of due to the minimal amount of options where coincidentally it ends up to be the same.

Since last year there has been a change in packaging multiple times on both the inside contents and outer from a more clear vacuum sized container to one less blatant and disguised almost by such writing outside, Outer packaging varies but realistically it will a bubble mailer or plastic mail bag for example more for volumetric reasons where there honestly isn't much choice

I also have an irrational fear, that I basically know not to be true, but that still irks me to this day. That's the idea of reincarnation, the idea that even if I died 1,000 times I would always come back into existence just to suffer another life time, in what could possibly be an even worse life then the one I am actively experiencing.

Reincarnation theory has effected me on many instances when considering my CTB, as I imagine Quantum immortality has to you.",,,,,,,,,,

Quantum immortality as a concept is terrifying,2675893,Forever Sleep,"Sep 20, 2024 at 2:35 AM","Unless this is your first ever life, one thing you know fairly reliably is that, if you do happen to live again, it will (most likely) be without the memory of this life and any other previous lives. Are your past lives bothering you or, is it this one? So, even if it's true, which honestly, I doubt, it likely won't feel like you've lived billions of years. Plus, unless there are parallel universes or whatever- you'll be someone else- surely? Different parents, likely different location, different era. That could be better or worse.

Eventually, if we haven't managed to make ourselves extinct already, the sun will explode and wipe us all out. Then, where do we go? Where were we when humans weren't on this planet? Did we inhabit dinosaurs at that point? How does all this recycling account for increases in population? Were those spirits/ souls/ consciousnesses in animals beforehand? Or, are they being created new? Or, do they come from beings from a different planet? Is that where imagination comes from? That would be kind of cool. If dragons and unicorns etc. actually exist somewhere.

I agree there are weird things about life and consciousness. I'm not a total sceptic. But still, I don't feel like many of these afterlife or multiple life theories are all that strong in terms of evidence. With the billions of lives and deaths that have played out on this earth, you would have thought something more definitive would be obvious by now.",,,,,,,,,,

27 club here i come,2672935,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 17, 2024 at 11:30 AM","For some people, loving yourself is to CTB. Loving yourself doesn't always mean you keep living ""just for yourself"". By definition, loving yourself involves acting in your own best interest. For some, especially many of us here, that involves killing yourself. And the only person who can determine what is best for themselves, is themselves, not anyone else looking at their situation from the outside.

It's okay now that you've apologized, but I would advise you to watch what you say in the future. You're free to speak as you like, of course. But don't be surprised if it backfires on you.

And I'd also ask, what's wrong with dying young? For some of us here, dying young is a good thing; philosophically, it's a very, very old idea that has not gone away, a perennial idea. You avoid future suffering at no cost to potential positives later on in life, cause you'll no longer exist to want nor need them. Life isn't all rainbows, sunshine, and 70 girlfriends for everyone. You should always keep in mind that, even though things turned out okay for you, most of the time things don't always turn out that well. By wanting someone young to continue living, you may end up sentencing them to an even worse situation later on in life. As I said, it goes both ways. And at the end of the day, we all die eventually, so what difference does it make if it happens today or 50-60 years from now? Eventually, everything you experienced will be erased. So the earlier you go, the less bullshit you endure, regardless of any positives that you may experience.",2672928,,,,,,,,,

My boyfriend. again.,2674698,girlwitharose,"Sep 18, 2024 at 8:57 PM","Hey everyone! Check out my first post and one saying ""my boyfriend"" for more context. Anyways, he cheated on me. Again. And again. Total: 3 times. I don't know why I put up with him. Mentally, I'm not in the relationship anymore but I haven't broken up with him. I'm going to be somewhat graphic but whatever. We hung out at a social event and found a private area. We made out and he ended up fingering me and I jerked him off . That makes it all the more painful because I found out the morning after he was cheating on me. The day prior to us hanging out, he was calling my friends friend beautiful and giving her all these compliments and basically asked her to fuck. That hurt bad. I cut myself a ton. My right leg is so fucked up. I hate myself and all of this. I know it isn't my fault because my mindset has changed but im sometimes thinking like ""what did she have?"" And I know there's nothing but it's so irritating. I'm so done with everything .
Oh and I keep sexualising myself in the way I dress out in public and to my boyfriend . He says ""I don't want to see that"" in a sad tone when I show him on ft and obviously in a mental breakdown but then he gets happy at it like ofc he's my boyfriend but im
Always sobbing while or something. I have always sexualised myself. At first I didn't, but recently I've been trying so hard to.",,,,,,,,,,
My boyfriend. again.,2674727,whywere,"Sep 18, 2024 at 10:02 PM","Yes, 68 years old and NO please do NOT give me crap about my age or life experience, I just want to help is all.

now with that out of the way, starting back in the early 1970's till now, usually once a cheater, male or female, always one. I have seen in the past 5 decades so many poor souls who cling onto a boy or girl friend either with the hope of change or that they will ""grow"" out of it. One word to that, NO!!

Thinking back through the decades, and I cry, for real, at all the pain and hell that I have seen with humans who cheat. Change the stripes on a skunk? Nope and usually neither with a cheater.

If I was you, and yes, it is damn painful, I would get the jerk out of one's life ASAP.

Also look at this aspect, and I have seen it so many times in the past, where if it is the boyfriend who is cheating. He gets his girlfriend in family way and then dumps her for the other gal that he has been cheating with. Then the poor gal has to either get a abortion or have the child by herself and then haul his cheating ass into court for child support payments.

Have seen it A LOT!

Back in the 1970's and the early 1980's, gals who got in family way and wound up by themselves with the poor child.

Also, the poor child does not get a break and a dad around.

Reading this brought back so very many memories and I cried writing this, as no one should have to put up with a ass hole, be it male or female.

My ex, cheated on me, as far as draining the checking and savings account because she had a HUGE gambling problem. Once I figured it out, I divorced her in a flash. She wanted another try and I was NOT going to put myself through that hell again ever, nope.

One and done and goodbye.

Lots of HUGE hugs, love caring thoughts, well wishes and always around.

He can fix his own issues and i am done being his punching bag when he is angry with his words. He always turned stuff on me and when i found out this time, he was like ""I hate myself. I dont know why i did this to you. im a bad boyfriend"" and i was even done with him in texts i was calling him out and all and i really will break up with him, now. I know it will be hard to and will for sure be difficult afterwards, But if it gets my own mental health back up, then i am going to do this.

"Losing My Will to CTB, Partly Because My Plan Has Too Many Points of Possible Failure",2675447,WhatMightHaveBeen,"Sep 19, 2024 at 4:00 PM","I have every financial and existential reason to CTB, but I'm losing the will to go through with it. This is a combination of sheer survival instinct, comfort with my current but fading housing situation, and fear about the weak points of my exit plan. Concerning the latter...

...I plan to exit using a fentanyl-laced heroin overdose (after a couple days in a motel room getting cracked off my tits), which right away is a weak point. As often as people fatally overdose on F-laced H in this country (tens of thousands per year), the odds of it happening on demand don't seem to be great. Purity of product is so iffy.

Next is the issue of procurement. I lost touch with my last ""plug"" (dealer) and contacting a new one carries the risk that it will be a honeypot resulting in arrest. I'm really not sure what I'd do then. Even if I manage to avoid a honeypot, I don't want to overdose and have police tracking down my plug to charge them with murder or manslaughter, and I really don't see any way around that part if I'm successful, even if I make it clear that my death by illicit opioids was a suicide.

If I attempt to procure drugs, I will literally have to stage an escape from my house which will result in immediate eviction once discovered. So there's no going back. I cannot currently even afford the reduced room and board at my family home and I definitely couldn't afford to live on my own after escaping. So initiating my exit plan automatically means I'd be homeless and without access to a car. I'd be out on the streets with no income and deeply in debt (including to the IRS!). I won't be able to afford another relatively peaceful attempt at CTB, and I know that I won't have the courage to attempt the cost-free and violent methods of jumping off a high place or in front of a speeding truck or train.

Ironically, as I was typing all this I got a notification from the bank that I'd failed to make the last payment on one of my credit cards, which is a first in a long time for me, and which made me think really hard if I am ready to make good on this shaky plan while I can still afford to. I realize that I am simply not, even though I will run out of money this month. The odds of success just aren't high enough (H+F overdose) while my SI isn't low enough. I wish I knew what to do.",,,,,,,,,,

What is the most practical yet lethal substance?,2675590,Fardarmist,"Sep 19, 2024 at 6:33 PM","I see this site talks about SN a lot and while it is easily obtainable at least in the states. It isn't as lethal of an option as I'd like. Many talk about various procedures to use it. Mostly to calm its affects so you can take a second cup if you spill your first one during the process. But the worry of vomiting is a scary one. I worry for someone like myself I'll need a lot. My body other than being large is just very resilient and I've always had a strong immune system.

Before I came here I was looking at helium and carbon monoxide. As the human body does not track and have a response to the lack of oxygen it has. Only the amount of carbon dioxide. You can keep breathing and pass out due to lack of oxygen as long as you can limit the amount of oxygen your body will breathe in even after you fall unconscious. Most thoughts with that are to get a mask and pure helium or any other gas. Anyone have anything to add about these or any other substances?",,,,,,,,,,

"1 year for a better life? or CTB? If you had the option between CTB and getting your life together, which would you choose?",2658333,Kassiee,"Sep 4, 2024 at 8:31 PM","If you were in a position where you wanted to CTB, but had the option to get your life somewhat together, would you take it?

The downside to this process is that it takes time, effort, and patience maybe around 5 to 7 months, or even up to a year. It will require energy and perseverance.

The upside, though, is that after going through it, you'll feel better not just slightly or significantly, but simply better than when you were considering CTB. In short, you'll be fairly happy, enjoy life more, and feel like you finally have a reason to live.

Or, you could choose to CTB and not have to worry about any of this just cease to exist in peace. But keep in mind, if you put in the effort over the next year, you'll likely feel much better than you do now.

So, long story short: which would you choose?",,,,,,,,,,

If you had the option between CTB and getting your life together, which would you choose?",2658541,SteamaHorns,"Sep 4, 2024 at 11:52 PM","I basically put myself through this plan and am going through it right now, though I guess minus the guarantee of a better life. The thing is that I'm mostly convinced that if I truly did commit myself to applying effort and persevering through my lack of desire and will everyday, then I really would be able to turn my life into something worth experiencing. I thought this plan would work given the initially intense fear-factor of promising to kill myself if I didn't achieve success, but I somehow managed to remain the way that I've always been despite the new motivation. I still get the fleeting hopeful thoughts and daydreams but they've become much less frequent and believable.

Honestly though, I'm sure this kind of plan has helped a lot of people and works to a degree. I've always had trouble with being sure of how I felt which extends towards whether or not I'd truly want to get my life together and be happy, so maybe I just need to come to terms with what kind of person I really am lol.",,,,,,,,,,

Recent experience with lamotrigine (Lamictal) + propranolol overdose,2587057,miminkpo,"Jul 6, 2024 at 8:42 AM","I took about four boxes total of 56 lamictal pills. I weigh about 85kg and I am 21 years old. I was found within two hours of ingestion and I was barely saved. I woke up from a coma after 10 days. I had seizures but don't remember having any pain, I just remember taking the pills, lying in bed and passing out. I combined it with about 200mg of propranolol but I'm pretty sure this method would have worked without it.

Right now I don't have a realible method to kill myself. I still have a box of around 30 pills of 50mg lamotrigine, plus quetiapine and clonazepam (around 56 pills of each). Also alcohol and tramadol. It is very unlikely these pills by themselves will kill me, but I'm wondering if I take everything at once... would that be enough? I don't have anything else available right now and I'm a bit desperate.

Fun fact, the hospital is going to publish a case study of my method since what I tried wasn't done before, as in the mix and the quantity of pills. They confirmed that what I did would have killed me 100% if I wasn't found in time... so, that's that.",,,,,,,,,,

Recent experience with lamotrigine (Lamictal) + propranolol overdose,2587202,Whale_bones,"Jul 6, 2024 at 12:12 PM","I'm glad you don't have any lasting effects, as far as you know. I don't know how recent this was, but I'd recommend taking a break to make sure your body is truly ""back to normal"".

Some people do luck out in terms of not having lasting effects, but there's also lots of effects that don't show symptoms immediately, so it's best to make sure everything is functioning normally before considering another risky attempt (where the side effects are unpredictable).

For anyone else reading this, the main risks of these methods are surviving with side-effects/organ damage. I took an overdose of Wellbutrin many years ago, it did cause me to go unconscious, have a seizure and need intensive hospital treatment. But the dosage per person, the time you need without being found, and other factors are so variable with these medication overdoses, and the risk of organ damage that you have to live with if you survive is high.

So I'd never say a medication OD like this is a good idea, even in desperate situations, considering the risks.",,,,,,,,,,

I happened to get on Lamotrigine because my Psych and I agreed that we wanted something low risk (hilarious in hindsight) physically (no high blood pressure so no check-ins like that. We've stuck to a decent dose now, and I take it consistently because it helps.

I always suffered from Migraines, and after 3 medication switches, we VERY RECENTLY got Propranolol. It made me extremely dizzy when I had them together and I thought I was just adjusting to the medication. After adjusting to it, I feel so much better. My mood is getting less heavy because I'm not in as much pain; it makes me feel hopeful.

The stuff you've got on hand isn't likely to be any more successful, probably not even as successful as your initial attempt. I had a similar experience with 22.5g of amitriptyline (mixed with a bunch of other stuff, an OD of lamotrigine was part of it, in addition to olanzapine, quetiapine, zoloidem, lorazepam, and alprazolam). They said they never saw anything like my OD either, on top of that bizarrely they tested for a bunch of things but none of them were what I took, I can't for the life of me imagine them not testing for benzos as that's standard procedure when I'm working. We have an antidote for benzos too, flumazenil. Unfortunately, OTC drugs are way way too safe, and if you can manage to keep a massive OD down they're just likely to maim you and cause a miserable death. Prescription drugs are by design more risky, but still super unlikely to kill you. The threshold is usually like 4x the max dose starts to become a risk of morbidity, but that's pretty much talking about the most dangerous drugs.",2587057,,,,,,,,,

My current plan,2654318,Cynacs,"Sep 1, 2024 at 5:45 PM","I've done it, put in an order for SN. I bought it on amazon (which hopefully I did correct). I may get a PO box and deliver it there or have UPS hold it, which I would do to try to hide it better.

I plan on taking the SN w/ water at night, then going to sleep asap. I can't get my hands on anti-emetics and this is my first thought of what to do. Also, doing it at night would give it plenty of time, but if I throw up I would likely be found. Maybe I do this outside where no one will hear? Maybe I lie and say I am spending a night with a friend (hard to pull off, I have no friends)?

On the other hand I've also contacted my therapist, just incase I don't end up going through with this plan.

Living how I am currently living is not an option, I've done a lot of things wrong. Either I get better, or I end it. Those are the options I am giving myself. I feel like this is a good way of dealing with these types of situations. Giving yourself an ultimatum, none of them being how you're currently living.

I have the stresses of work, school and an alcoholic mother on top of anxiety and depression and autism and so much bs. Thankfully I can say I at least havent self harmed in a few months.
