"people diagnosed with OCD, can you help me by telling me if you experience these symptoms?",2631870,loslassen,"Aug 14, 2024 at 5:02 PM","quite a random post compared to my usual postings, I know this is the suicide discussion section, and I know the question might come across as outlandish but let me explain.

I've been heavily suspecting I might suffer from ocd, but I am unable to get a diagnosis, I will not use the information or shared experiences I get from this thread irresponsibly, I will not self diagnose or spread any unrevised or unsupported/unsourced claims, I am well aware that superstition and suggestion partake greatly in how own views oneself, but I pm just trying to connect, understand, I want to use these answers to take some insight into myself and know a little bit more about what i'm going through and how others' perspectives can resonate with me, in short, im just looking for some answers.

I never consumed real life gore media, but I have seen some, and I'm glad to say i'm not desensitized from it so yes, it scares me and makes me incredibly uncomfortable and grossed out knowing that is a real sentient person who felt pain, timelessly captured in a video.

I am also very conscious of the differences between reality and fiction, gorey content has never enticed or scared me in movies or shows, never given me nightmares or anything alike, but recently, even though I haven't really watched anything of that nature in a while i've been feeling incredibly random violent urges or having violent flashing thoughts towards the people I love the most :( it's really scary and painful because it's just random, I don't imagine the consequences, and can't begin to imagine myself in the situation harming them, so I know I am not capable of that, but the mere thought coming across randomly makes me want to throw up.

why does this happen? I can't find anything sensible or understandable enough in the internet, and I suspect it may have to do with undiagnosed OCD I might be experiencing.

… do you experience this? how do you cope with it?

also, if you want to share personal experiences, how has this affected, increased or decreased your suicidal ideation?
for me it hasn't made much change, i haven't felt intrusive towards myself to a point to where it has genuinely affected me or my mental health.

(of course, there is a collection of other symptoms that i will list below that have made me believe I might have OCD, which has made it difficult to get through life. /you can skip this but just to inform there's other reasons that have made me suspect/

compulsive lying.
I lie to people confidently about small things, I don't know why I do it but I hate it. For example saying ""Oh yeah I watched a movie about it, or I did my research"" though I didn't, I remember lying about things when I was a child too, for example ""I tried this chocolate called whatever"" since I noticed this, I've been able to stop myself and this doesn't happen as often anymore.

repetitive mental speech.
sometimes I will repeat a word or phrase in my mind involuntarily, not like when you're reminding yourself of something you don't want to forget, sometimes I will randomly choose a word I just heard or thought and repeat it in my mind, for example. ""whale, whale, whale, whale, wha-le, whale""
it can go on up to an hour and its like a voice in my head, but my own, not a hallucination or anything like that.

anxiety and fixation
I am generally a mentally anxious person, but Im sure this is because of conditioning and trauma, I'm always tense and on edge, specially alert and always making plans and arranging stuff in my mind.

childhood impulsiveness.
im impulsive a lot of the time, I remember biting a kid one time because I couldn't measure my own body and the way it affects others, growing up I also injured myself a lot cause I didn't have enough bodily awareness to calculate not hitting my head on my bunk bed for example, idk.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,

ive got friends with ocd, one of which i talked to a lot about this years ago, but he never described anything similar to these symptoms
of course it might just be that symptoms vary wildly from one person to another but im really not sure if my issue is ocd
this might not be particularly helpful but i figured itd be better than nothing
i suspect my issue is something else entirely, but i havent looked into it further and also never told my psychiatrist because it felt like not that big of an issue to me, and i also felt kind of silly about it
oh i do have autism though, which might help explain some of these issues. ive gotten that diagnosis quite late in my life too, only after i had already sought help for my various other mental issues, and i didnt believe it at first because i thought autistic people were like,, really weird. but it did make some of my experiences make a lot more sense suddenly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"people diagnosed with OCD, can you help me by telling me if you experience these symptoms?",2640444,Manfrotto99,"Aug 21, 2024 at 7:11 AM","I have a friend who was recently diagnosed with ocpd, ptsd and gad. I think he may have some adhd too. Some of what you describe fits him. He isnt a compulisive lyer but can lie in order to avoid getting caught when he is trying to avoid something. I wouldn't say he is very impulsive. Diagnosis for ocd and ocpd is based on things like hoarding, perfectionism, obsession or fixation, avoidance, going over lists (written or in head), unrealistic fears such as germs, need for control, a miserly approach to money and distrust of others. He has all of them to varying degrees, depending on how stressed he is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people diagnosed with OCD, can you help me by telling me if you experience these symptoms?",2640607,loslassen,"Aug 21, 2024 at 10:19 AM","thanks for replying!

I do experience intense perfectionism in my activities specifically art, I do digital art as an almost full time job.
it will genuinely stress me out and I won't complete a piece until it's perfect, even if it takes me months, if it's not turning out properly i will cry, get very frustrated or externalize it by smashing my screen.. (the last one more due to my hands sweating and giving me the worst sensory experience, i'm unable to control it and it slows me down significantly, affecting my productivity)
I also experience fixation, mostly over negative things rather than positive, such as one specific concern I am unable to get off of my mind. i also experience obsession but with topics i'm currently enjoying, as an artist it often sends me into a creative spiral where I only enjoy what i'm obsessing with and nothing else.
I'm not an avoidant person at all, I used to push people away, but after overcoming that fear, i honestly wouldn't consider myself avoidant.
I am going over lists in my head like, ALL the time, involuntarily, it frustrates me often and won't rest my head until those chores, activities or anything is over with.
I do experience a need for control all the time. mostly over miscellaneous things like day plans, my art, conversations, schedules, since my life is a mess of things that never turn out, that's why i'm so depressed, but the smaller things i have in my hands, they CAN NOT go wrong or the way I don't want them to without it affecting me physically, it makes me stress, get frustrated, restless, headaches, and even ill. I have been bettering with this, but it happens all the time still.
money doesn't mean much to me, this due to my high values and things learned at home, I don't expect anything back when I lend people money, and i wouldn't argue over it ever, I see it as a poor way of thinking.
I am heavy on the distrust to others though, even though i am direct and assertive, I will never show anyone the whole lot of me, I also have a very contradictory personality, values and approach on life, fortunately this hasn't cause me problems in life and i've never seen it as anything negative, but it's there.
I experience ptsd, specially recently. I can say this without a diagnosis idgaf, I'm irrationally on edge, react to certain stimulus that I relate to my trauma gravely, and I experience triggers from time to time, it makes me physically uncomfortable, and makes me want to cry.
a lot of these things make me react physically negatively and escalate on that, i don't have control over these things which has led my life to feel miserable, and affect me directly.


I mostly wrote this down to overview it myself, but what do you think?
I don't believe I have adhd at all, my mind is running all the time but I know that's because of stress, because when i'm having a good time I'm able to relax and lay back, I am able to focus and concentrate in activities, I memorize things easily and I rarely experience anxiety unless i'm breaking down, I have control over my body, and my way of being, demeanor and face, it just doesn't vibrate adhd, if that makes sense.
honestly, I might be autistic, though.",2640444,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people diagnosed with OCD, can you help me by telling me if you experience these symptoms?",2640673,VeryShy,"Aug 21, 2024 at 11:21 AM","I suffer from very severe OCD for years, but I can't identify with all of the symptoms that you have mentioned. OCD for me comes as a consequence of autism and/or schizophrenia.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"people diagnosed with OCD, can you help me by telling me if you experience these symptoms?",2640749,Hanaga,"Aug 21, 2024 at 1:17 PM","This doesn't sound like OCD.
Violent urges or thoughts - negative thoughts are normal, what's not normal is your reaction to them. All people have various thoughts - positive, neutral and negative. People tend to fixate on negative thoughts. By fixating on these thoughts, you are signaling to your brain that they are important, and they WILL resurface again because of your reaction to them. For example, thought ""I want to murder my family."" passes through you. You immediately concentrate on it and think about something like ""Noooo I don't want to do it, I love them"" and think even more about reasons why you would never do it. By doing this, you signal your brain to give you even more thoughts like that. You would never fixate on thoughts like ""I want to spend time with my family. I want to buy ice cream"" etc. That's just a random negative thought flowing through your brain, same as positive or neutral. That's it. If you wash your hands for five hours straight after a negative thought, I'd say you definitely have OCD.
Compulsive lying
Not an OCD symptom, more like pathological lying or desire to fit in
Repetitive mental speech
Sounds more like a habit.
Anxiety and fixation
Honestly it's a very common symptom for many mental illnesses and it may not be a symptom at all.
Childhood impulsiveness
Not an OCD symptom
Out of the limited things you wrote, I would say look more into ADHD and autism instead of OCD. My opinion is subjective and means nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some people can develop ocd as a coping mechanism that masks something else like adhd or autism. But I would say you lean more towards ocpd than ocd and there can be some confusion between ocpd and autism. Maybe something like autism with ocpd tendencies, then again you also have ptsd and that confuses things too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loneliness Megathread,1339975,LastLoveLetter,"Sep 23, 2021 at 6:48 PM","A recurring theme I have seen on this forum is persistent and profound loneliness. There are many members who have no companionship or connections in their lives at all, always alone and isolated. Others may have some relationships in their lives, but still feel alienated or neglected.

Some have shared that their seclusion has directly caused their suicidality. Some have stated that loneliness exacerbates it. Being suicidal is in itself often a lonely experience, resulting in ostracism and struggling to find understanding. I truly feel that SS is an important lifeline for us. I have encountered nowhere else we can discuss suicidality, systemic exclusion and social rejection so candidly.

The palpable desolation and soul crushing despair that many of us feel is unfathomable to those with healthy, loving support networks. I often find personally that people do not understand that going out and cultivating these connections is not always possible.

As such, I decided to create a Megathread for this subject. The aim is for those who are lonely in life to have a space where they can vent their frustrations, discuss their positions with others in a similar situation and support each other - perhaps even connecting with one another in the process (and becoming a little less lonely as a result).

You can post as much or as little as you like. I will always try my best to check in regularly, both to share and to respond to others.

I'll start by saying that I have always found it difficult to create and subsequently maintain connections, and have long suspected that I am autistic. I have no family and no friends. I am fortunate to have a boyfriend. Although I truly appreciate him, due to the the extent of my illnesses I feel very alone in the world, especially since my symptoms are routinely dismissed and undermined by peers and professionals alike. I often feel like such a burden that it means we do not have a typical relationship, as it revolves around my limitations when we are together. I am awaiting the day he eventually leaves to pursue a balanced relationship, and I truthfully would not blame him if he chooses to separate. I cannot even fulfill his needs romantically due to my illnesses and Complex PTSD, and the guilt of that crushes me.

I spend most of my life housebound, and a large proportion of it bedbound. SS is the only thing I have resembling a social network.

My hope for this thread is that some of us may find even a little bit of solace and solidarity from each other.

Staff will monitor this thread to ensure it stays on topic and is a safe, supportive space for those who participate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loneliness Megathread,1340044,littlelungs,"Sep 23, 2021 at 9:35 PM","I'm likewise chronically ill, way too many problems to list here, but I've mentioned the lot of them a few times around this forum. Being chronically ill in my case means (among many others) extreme isolation, because any sensory stimulation or physical activity leads to permanent worsening and thus further suffering that I cannot afford. I'm housebound and mostly bedbound, spending most of my days in a dark room with earplugs in. I rarely speak because, again, permanent worsening, so I mainly communicate over text. I've tried to make friends online a couple of times, but because I can't speak and I can't always reply in a timely manner, it never works out. Also, most people just don't understand what it means to be chronically ill and its implications and consequences, and while I'm glad on the one hand that they don't have the experience to understand that, it just means further social isolation.

The social isolation in and of itself isn't what bothers me or makes me feel lonely (I've always been introverted and have preferred to keep my circle small, even before I became severely physically ill, and I'm very wary of other people and their intentions, which I don't think is unreasonable); rather it's the fact that I rarely feel heard by most other people, and had to fight for so long just to get someone to listen when it really mattered. The only person who truly understands IRL is my husband (likewise severely chronically ill) and to a large extent my mom (who always tries to understand), and at this point I just don't have it in me anymore to constantly explain myself and my situation to people who clearly don't even care to begin with, and I often badly struggle to put my thoughts and experiences into words, anyway, which is probably already apparent in this post. My reality is (and almost always has been) just too far-off from what most other people can really fathom, and because of this, the more people I'm around, the lonelier I feel.

This is a great idea for a thread, @-Persephone-. Just as an aside, you're one of the members in particular who I can relate to the most, just based on what I've read here, but I'm nowhere even close to being as articulate as you are. I just tend to ramble on and on to no true end, and then when I finally do decide to wrap it up I don't even know if what I said made sense and feel the need to apologize for it and add disclaimers and shit then I feel like an anxious, obnoxious twat. My mind is just a total disaster 24/7.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Loneliness Megathread,1340046,Amumu,"Sep 23, 2021 at 9:41 PM","You're right, it's an important lifeline to be told to kill yourself by some members (and to be ostracised at the same time, paradoxically and) to never write anything under the pretence ""you derail threads"" while you just respond calmly to people's comments.

Loneliness Megathread,1340087,Phosphophyllite,"Sep 23, 2021 at 11:35 PM","I think I've become desensitized to my loneliness. I've been lonely for so long that I genuinely don't desire to connect with others anymore, and I actively isolate myself from the world. It's probably just a coping mechanism my brain latched onto after dealing with loneliness for my entire life. I suspect a combination of a disadvantaged upbringing and undiagnosed autism is why I always had trouble with people and relationships. I don't feel human and I feel as if I wasn't meant to be in this world.

Trauma is very alienating and, needless to say, it has aggravated my loneliness; normal people can't understand my experiences and I can't understand their experiences. When one of my few loved ones was dying of a terminal illness, the world continued to move on as if nothing was happening—I absolutely loathed the fact that people were still enjoying their lives while my own world was falling apart. I now know that was an irrational and selfish feeling, but I've never really recovered ever since. I also had no one to talk to about my trauma, which of course made me feel even more alone.

I used to be funny and could hold conversations, I don't even know how I made friends back then but that persons dead now. I have nothing to offer people anymore, it's upsetting because I realized if you don't have anything to offer (being funny/entertaining, looks, etc…) people don't really want to be around you or establish a relationship with you. People don't really like you for your general existence. I feel like it was that way for me, I had to perform while the other person could just 'be'and I would still consider them a ""friend"". I don't try anymore, I stay in the house all the time, I don't think I ever had a true genuine friend since maybe elementary school or even kindergarten (sad I know). My parent is around but honestly things are different now and I realized I don't feel comfortable around them at all neither do I really want to be around them (stems from childhood), so I basically have no one.

i also have the constant feeling that being alone is the safest thing one can do to not hurt others and theirself, until death takes them out. it's scary to hurt others, even if you don't mean to , even if they aren't aware of it.

The feeling of not having a gf has been causing me an average of perhaps 5 minutes of mild to moderate emotional pain per day for the past 5 years or so. Now, that's the estimated average; if I were to map it out, the pain would be made up of a few days a week with intense but short ""tfw no gf"" and a few episodes a month of intense and prolonged crying/fetal position/weird moments/silent screaming/laughing. And there are of course daily small instances of pain that I don't really count since they are not enough to cause any impairment.

Loneliness Megathread,1340194,OrcWitch,"Sep 24, 2021 at 4:23 AM","I think I was born to be lonely. I was born to a vulnerable narcissistic mother and a robot father. They were both emotionally incapable of giving affection, and the only adult who gave me affection was my grandpa. I grew up as a latchkey kid, cooking myself meals and raising myself. By age 9 I noticed that other children's parents paid more attention to them. My dad worked and shut himself in a room in the basement, my mom locked herself in the master bedroom and you had to walk on eggshells not to make her explode.

In early grade school I was ""that kid"" who smelled like shit, because my parents didn't do anything to have a pleasant smelling child. A few times my mom blew up out of nowhere and screamed at me for smelling bad, in retrospect I believe this is because another adult called her out on it and I was a source of making her look bad. It made me alienated and the weird kid. It wasn't until 4th grade I developed the maturity to ensure I smelled fine.

In middle school my few friends abandoned me. That sounds melodramatic but I had 3 best friends. They all became too cool to be seen with me, and became the three musketeers without me. Once they invited me to the dance and encouraged me to come with, then when I went with them they told me to go away and that they didn't want me around them. In retrospect they kept me around as the punching bag, and I basically hungout with them to be bullied by them. I basically shut down and didn't talk to anyone, and I got into mmorpgs and online forums.

My parents got divorced because my mom was an unstable psycho, and I started living with my dad and grandpa. My second day living with them they sat me down and yelled at me for being overweight, then my dad put rotting molding salad mix on a plate and made me eat it, telling me I needed to start eating healthier. Despite this my grandpa basically forced fast food on me everyday. He started molesting me in the morning when he got me up for school. I played world of warcraft and used 4chan and thought about committing suicide all the time. I stopped brushing my teeth or taking care of myself at all really. I dropped out of highschool and got my GED. I lost all my weight and became skinny when I started working and feeding myself, and emotionally coping with marijuana and alcohol and tobacco instead of food. I have not been overweight since.

On my 19th birthday my mom sent me an email apologizing for moving away, and saying she loved me and had been a horrible mother to me. She convinced me to move to her 6 months later. That went well for a few months until she started getting mad at me for working a fastfood job and sleeping on her couch. She stole my money a few times, then acted like the victim when I got upset. She screamed at me for crying on my 20th birthday because she perceived it as an attack on her. She kicked me out that December, and I had to sleep on the floor of my manager's apartment. I got an air mattress soon and built a comfy life at his house, and his wife felt sorry for me. But they were opiate addicts and always extorting money from me, so it was very hard to save to get an apartment. I was young and immature, and did a botched attempt at killing myself while living with them by trying to overdose laying in the snow in the woods. Instead I just vomited like crazy, went home and laid in the bathtub for 3 hours.

Eventually I moved in with an older woman who was looking for a roommate, she was in her early 30s and I was about to turn 21. I couldn't find a friend or boyfriend. My sister said she would go to my 21st birthday, but instead she went out to some costume party thing. My mom sent me pictures of my sister out having fun that night. I invited 5 people from work and they all stood me up, and I drank alone at a bar then went home. It was after that point I gave up on being outgoing, and I found it more comfortable to just sit on the computer than to risk rejection.

I eventually found me savior relationship but it turned physically abusive eventually. One evening my abuser gave me a concussion by hitting me in the back of the head while I had my back turned, and I already had a bruised cheek and eye from the previous few days. I am in therapy for some of the violence I put up with during it and was diagnosed with PTSD.I also have gone no contact with my mom and sister, as they have both treated me poorly. I have not had another real life relationship since then.

I got a job where a girl at work started to be my friend. I even took a bus to a mall with her and we went shopping and got lunch together. At work one day I was within ear shot(people speak very loudly), she was talking about going out drinking with 2 other girls from work that weekend. This girl who was trying to be my friend threw in a suggestion they invite me, and the other girl gave this sarcastic ""uh... yeah we'll see about that...."" response. I tried to act worldly and like I was too high iq to feel anything about it, but I cried pretty hard in my bed once I got home. I moved away and did not bother keeping contact with her.

I made a real life friend in 2020 and I spent a lot of time with her, and she was nice to me. She found a relationship and moved away, and I am back to being alone. I have discord friends and they are what keeps me sane. Sometimes I think I am more grown up and less affected by my isolation, I do not cry very often and feel mellow most of the time. but I am in a discord server of mostly females. I saw them talking about going out partying and having boyfriends and it made me cry the other night, I rarely cry but felt this huge wave of jealousy.

I am turning 29 in a few months and I have never lived. I have a tremendous lump in my throat writing any of this. I feel like I was born to have this failure of a life. Legitimately the only reason I do not kill myself is holding out for the day I have friends and a job and a marriage, and I am not alone. I go to college and I comfort myself in bed at night by playing these little movie clips in my head of the things I would do as a person in a relationship. I want to die because I am losing confidence of this ever coming true. I don't know why I had to be born.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Loneliness Megathread,1340215,sadworld,"Sep 24, 2021 at 5:26 AM","Thank you so much for this thread. You're struggling yourself but you still care about the loneliness of other people. That's so unbelievably kind of you.
Loneliness is also one of my main struggles.

I've been hurt many times by other people in the past so I am afraid to make friendships or socialise, even online. Besides that my avpd keeps me from any social interactions irl and it also sometimes affects me online as well.

In groups for example I am always the one who gets left out, in real life but also online. I feel like I never fit in anywhere.

All my life long I have been trying to overcome my social anxiety but everytime I did I was always left and forgotten. It hurts like hell when you are always the one person everyone cares the least about.

I've never had any relationship and the last time I had friends was back in 5th grade. Before that, my life was pretty normal but after that was when all the bullying and getting abandoned by ""friends"" started.

I still kept trying and trying to fit in but it made everything worse and worse.

I don't want to get hurt anymore.
A part of me still hopes that maybe one day I will find someone who understands me. Because this loneliness hurts.

But the most part of me has already lost all hope.

I hope to find love and everything I could not find on this world in death.

Loneliness Megathread,1340220,RainAndSadness,"Sep 24, 2021 at 5:57 AM","That's a good thread. I've been lonely my entire life but ever since I did my transition, I haven't really had any romantic or sexual experiences anymore and it's a very important reason as to why I regret transition to a certain extend. Sure, I feel a lot more comfortable in my body now but at what cost? I've completely killed my social life and any perspective to ever have a fulfilling relationship ever again. According to studies, only close to 2% of the general (heteronormative) population is willing to date us. What does that mean? The chances of people actually being into you (despite being trans) are very slim. And most people that are ready to have sexual intercourse with trans people only do so because they get a huge kick out of that. As sad as it is, we are just a kink for many people and nothing more, thanks to the porn industry that lumps transgender people and ""shemales"" together and portrays us as sexual deviants that only wait to have our dicks sucked. You know it's true when the first question of most people expressing interest into you is about your genitals. And this image that's out there now thanks to the porn industry couldn't be further from the truth but we have to deal with this fantasy of other people on daily base. We have to serve as the outlet of the depraved fantasies of other men. This unhealthy bias affects mostly trans women, as far as I know. I don't know why, but guys think it's super hot if a woman has a dick - which isn't the problem. The problem is when we're solely reduced to our genitals and that's the case very often. I want to be seen as an individual with feelings and desires and not as a cock attached to a female body. I'm more than just ""trans"". Anyway, here is the link to said study.

People just generally give me anxiety and I'm admittedly very sensitive to rejection when I *do* put myself out there, and I always feel like no matter what I say, it's stupid and nobody wants to hear it... which could very well be true, but that doesn't mean it doesn't feel bad and that the mere thought of people judging me doesn't nag away at me while I'm writing up a post. There have been quite a few times where I've wanted to participate in a discussion but felt like everything I was saying was all wrong, or I just couldn't get the thoughts out at all. Again, I just have a really difficult time expressing myself between the brain fog, invalidation, trauma, anxiety etc, and the fact that I often feel like words are simply inadequate.

As for not being completely bitter... I'm not gonna lie, it's hard not to be, but more than anything, I'm just so fucking tired. This life has beaten me to a pulp and I take solace in the fact that every passing day is one day closer to finally getting some actual god damn rest.

And at the risk of sounding like a self-righteous prick (here I go again with the disclaimers), I think a good part of why I try to show as much empathy and compassion towards others as I possibly can, is because I know how awful it feels to constantly be treated like absolute garbage and the kind of long-term consequences that it can have on a person, and I just want to (at least) be one less asshole in their life – and I think this is the case for a lot of others as well. It's also just always been important to me that other people feel welcome and included, so whenever I see someone who's lonely (and doesn't want to be) I just feel for them so much. It truly breaks my heart to read all of these posts, and I admit I shed a few tears because of it.

He often pressures me into sex even though I don't want to do it. He will say things like 'do you not love me?' or 'I thought you wanted to be with me'. This is just the beginning of it. If I continue to say no, he will literally beg me until it wears me down and tell me that it's my fault he's horny so I should sort it out, even when I haven't initiated anything sexual. If this doesn't work, he resorts to calling me names and stuff like 'prude'.

A couple of days ago, he came over to my house and we were watching a movie together. Literally 10 minutes into the movie he was pestering me for sex. I told him no. I don't think I could have been any clearer. But still, he did it anyways. It lasted the whole movie. I'm sorry this is not very detailed, I just really don't want to think about it. It's been affecting my mood over the last couple of days. I can't stop thinking about it. It's made me feel worthless to him.

All four are prescription drugs, likely for this individual who has either bipolar or schizoaffective but it's possible other things like very severe anxiety or depression. This individual isn't overdosing on over the counter meds, these are specifically prescribed for a specific disorder or disorders

Adding extra, there are over the counter sleeping meds which if you took say, 1000mg of zzzquil, odds are your gonna have a seizure and potentially drop dead. When medication has use with high demand, they aren't gonna bother banning it, since it helps a significant amount more than it hurts. If someone does use it inappropriately, it's not the meds fault, and since it's not something that is niche, it won't be removed. Especially if it's already FDA.

Reread this and as a disclaimer. This is not me endorsing overdosing on sleeping meds. It's a really risky way of going. Yes, in theory if you take an extremely high dosage you probably will just fall asleep and not awake, but how high that dosage is going to be very difficult to determine. My advice, find a better alternative. The same goes with oding on sedatives of any kind. You risk seizures and comas for something which is unlikely to be a one attempt thing. Additionally, should your brain be deprived of oxygen long enough to cause permanent damage, this would essentially remove any scrap hope of a recovery since even if you decided to forgo cbt you would have a myriad of new health related problems.

As for the possibility that the meds are the cause of OPs ideation, assuming OP got their prescriptions from their psychiatrist and not their GP, I'd hope that any adverse affects would have been addressed in the subsequent follow up checkups, which are standard practice. They said they had been taking their medication for fourteen years, which unless their psychiatrist(or psychiatrists since it's such a long period) was inept or uncaring, likely would have been noticed during the checkups to approve for more medication or dosage changes. That isn't to say it's not possible or unlikely that the medication is the problem, since everyone experiences the meds somewhat uniquely and poor mental healthcare workers isn't unheard of. The system isn't perfect, but as with most things it tends to air on the side of caution, so given the decade long medication usage, assuming the psychiatrist is properly trained and involved in their work, id hope this isn't the cause of OPs problems.",2649959,,,,,,,,,,,,

I shouldn't see it as a curse, it's a blessing. Seeing the truth is a blessing, right? It has to be. Why am I special?

..Maybe I am the only one strong enough to handle the truth. Maybe all of you would instantly give in and rather kill themself. I mean, I've tried before, that was before I realised it a blessing not a curse. Now I'm trying because they tell me to. They tell all of you to.
The voices in your head that tell you to kill or hurt yourself? That's them.

Don't listen to them.


I hate this part of me. Why am I special? I don't want to be special.
Stop complaining, it's a blessing. Be grateful.


I don't want to be the one that sees anymore.


I have a feeling that I will dearly regret sharing this with anyone. I don't think I am allowed to speak out the truth. I am afraid of the consequences.
I could never tell anyone in real life. They would think I am sick.

He and his mother were heading down to Florida when they stopped at a restaurant to get something to eat. They got in some type of argument and he, basically, stole her car and left her there. She called the cops and reported it. Later, somewhere near-ish to where they were, the cops spotted him and a chase ensued. I guess it was dusk and somehow he managed to get ahead of the cops enough that they lost sight of him. Apparently, he turned off into a water-treatment-type facility and proceded to drive the car up an embankment and ""launched"" the car into a ""holding pond"" reservoir. The cops didn't see him turn into the place and called off the search. The next day, maybe the day after, they used his last phone pings to determine his last approximate whereabouts and came to the conclusion that he was, in all likelihood, in the water-treatment facility somewhere. They ended up checking the reservoirs and found his car with him still inside. There didn't seem to be any attempt for him to escape, so, maybe, hopefully, he was either knocked-out from the impact of hitting the embankment at a high rate of speed, or from the impact of hitting the water. I hope he was knocked-out because I think it would have been terrifying to be conscious, and unintentionally die, entombed in your vehicle.

Sitting down and thinking outside the box already provided me answers to most of my questions.

I see some of you have said that my questions are hard to understand. I had felt this way too a little bit, but I have been so sick recently (high wbc count, losing weight) and I think it's affecting my mind. Plus, I am exhausted from the pain. So forgive me if that's the case but go ahead and ask for clarification anytime. I don't really know what else to do about it otherwise..sorry

I also want to note some thing I had totally not thought of before at all. People not replying to me or PMing me about my question because it is too direct and of course being afraid of legality. I am so sorry about that. that makes perfect sense. I can change that if that's what I need to do, I don't know how I should phrase it then, but I am at least not crazy if not humble. if someone tells me how I should phrase something more discreetly so it works, I will listen to you the first time.

of the questions I have left I think they really just regard checking if my method (roa) is all right, and the source of my drug on the DNM. (something 'strong' or 'pure' enough than last time. Oh, and it has to be domestic to US. Don't wanna piss off customs.)

I turn 25 in less than a month....I think I want out by then,2653650,MyTimeIsUp,"Sep 1, 2024 at 8:08 AM","Your teens and twenties are the hardest, by far. I had this mentality until I hit 30, and realised I have plenty of time.

You are still very young, but understand all this is very normal. You are still finding yourself, and this is something everyone experiences, some don't until much later in life, and that's ok.

Why does everything have to be done at the tender age of 25? There is so much pressure on young people to have done certain things at a particular age, which is wrong. But, as you age you will realise that - like I did, and my friends - my older friends told me this at the time, but I couldn't see it. Now I do.

Depression is a rough battle, but you can get through it, with extra support around you, and self help. I'm not saying you haven't tried, but your mind is very different at 25, to say 30, and perhaps there are things you haven't tried yet.

Take it from me, I'm 35 and have struggled with mental illness since I was a child, but I'm learning to manage better - and that's what it's about. I have had a lifetime worth of believing 'I've accepted I will die by suicide, and I'm ok with it', but I'm still here, although yes, I've tried countless times to end it, but I obviously want to be here or I would try to end my life, day in, day out.

There is no cure, it will always be there, so it's important to learn better coping strategies in order for you to continue on, and it can be achieved - the hardwork has to be put in though. It takes time, you'll have blips in the road which is completely normal and ok - it's ok to have bad days, but to move forward, being kind to yourself is so important, and reminding yourself you can get through this",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I say off and on because at reassessments they sometimes award me zero points and stop my payments, then I have to go through an appeal to get them reinstated. When this happens I end up living off an overdraft, and when I finally get my benefits reinstated with backpay, the backpay is never enough to pay off the debt due to overdraft charges. So I sink further into debt each time. Now my overdraft is totally maxxed out, I have literally no money, not even for food. The local food bank is shit, takes ages to get a referral and I can't eat most of the food they give due to food intolerances caused by my cancer treatment. I'm literally starving to the point that I was diagnosed with multiple vitamin deficiencies. Now I get vitamin tablets on the NHS, but I still have no money for food!

I developed psychosis in 2010 and my current diagnosis is schizoaffective disorder and I hear voices and can't work. The voices are part of the reason I'm ctbing but they're not the whole story. Like you, I'm on benefits. I live with my mum and she basically keeps the house warm cos she has a good pension but when she dies (she's 89) I won't have enough money to keep the house warm.

I just absolutely refuse to live a life like that, I would much, much rather be dead.

Opioids + alcohol (and or benzos) is a high-frequency source of deaths, like in your great-grandmother's case.
Problem is access to potent opioids, it is tough to get a script for painkillers and you pretty much gotta turn to the dark web markets for fentanyl, nitazines or other high potency opioids.

A possible alternative is the ""Matthew Perry"" method like combining something that will straight knock you the eff out with a body of water or a significant fall. This is something I'm thinking about. Like efftons of DXM and alcohol to pass out and drown while unaware type of thing. But yeah reliability is iffy and the setup is fear-inducing itself.

Sucks man I wish the govt would just do one good thing and offer on-demand euthanasia.

Method is the next obvious question. I considered more violent options, but frankly, while I'd like a big dramatic long and somewhat painful death, I'm not a huge fan of blood. That's why I choose anti freeze. Its slow acting, and no blood. So long as I'm not caught early on, I'll die.

Last question would be when. I'd give it like a month or two from now, I'm really not in a rush but at the same time I'm not wanting to stick around. I have some affairs to be put in order and such.

besides being alone is better than someone who's shallow and only with you cause you're attractive and nice lol. or i guess for men it's better than dating someone who's with you for money and emotional support.

No, it doesn't suck. Being alone can be genuinely great. It unlocks time and things I can't really do with people. It's about finding the fortes of a situation that aren't present elsewhere, and exploiting them. Even the hardest thing becomes easier.

That is beyond selfish and cruel. You're literally wasting her time when the man for her, the one that actually finds her attractive is looking and waiting for their person who is being used by you to fulfill some sick selfish desire so you're not alone? A partner shouldn't COMPLETE your life and if that's how it is then you might have to think about finding out why that is, most likely cuz you're unhappy with yourself and nothing, not even a girl is going to fix that emptiness inside you. Even if it feels like it's working, it will reappear again.
Everyone says that and honestly are you prepared for it? Plenty of people cry about relationships but none of them can hack it. Are you going to burden them with your constant depression? Yes, most people will see it as a burden after a while because that's life. Do you know how much works goes into a relationship? Do you know sex is not guaranteed or an everyday or even every week thing in a relationship? Not all relationship are like that and you have to be okay with you. Are you? Are you going to meet all her emotional and financial needs? Are you going to make her life easy? Can you even? It's not all about you or your desires and emotions. Be romantic? Listen to her? Go on dates? Pay for the dates? Treat her great? And not just say you will, actually do it. Most men just add stress to a woman life. What are you even adding to her life? You guys talk a big game and cry all day long about wanting your desires met but reality is, life doesn't owe you a romantic partner. It's never guaranteed. Just because you want it, doesn't mean you deserve it. Doesn't mean you've earned it. If that was the case, none of us would be here right now contemplating our suicide because we're in situations that can't be EASILY fixed. We have issues that requires meds and therapy and learning coping skills with no guarantee of a happy future or a healed brain. If your problem is finding someone, you'd actually put in the work. Most men are ugly anyways, you just have to do a bit of work to be a 5 and gain a personality but plenty of woman date losers.

That's why no one takes us serious and acts like our problems are fixable because of the small delusional groups of people that need to wake the F up. Even if it was easier to die from legal euthanasia, you'd still need a VALID reason. If someone want to die cuz they can't find someone, then oh will but nothing is lost. But if my problems were as simple as that, I'd find the closest idiot. My favorite quote after is all beggars can't be choosers so if you're begging for a relationship, well go to the nearest neighborhood, there is hookers out there and homeless people that will surely do anything for a place or a couple of bucks. That's nothing sad. That's nothing out of your control. Those are fixable. If you're ugly then work on it. You're fat? Oh well count calories and lose weight. You dress ugly? If you have a job, then surely you can buy better clothes. You've got pimples? If you have insurance or a job you can go to the dermatologist to get that fixed. Clear skin, dressing well, being fit and having low standard makes it pretty easy to find any low grade relationships and no one deserves the best possible relationship just because they're here, especially when some people NEED things that's vital to living and they can't even get that! Being happy is one thing but if a romantic relationship is all you need to be happy then sad to say but you have a lot of things you need to work on. Being lonely isn't something that can only be fixed through romantic relationships, actually friendships are much more important for that long term. So miss me with that BS. If that was majority of our problems, we wouldn't need this website for that. I wouldn't even be contemplating ending my life if that was my problem. Look at everyone. How many of them can say their relationships is good? Most of them are dating lying scums and telling themselves it's love when in reality love isn't real! I am just so tired of the constant pandering to you guys as if we're not all suffering worse. And then you guys tell yourselves that it's not a competition but it's funny how we're all in the same shoes but some people's wound are deeper than others. I guess it really isn't the same after all and the sooner we're honest about that, the easier it is to recognize the difference and maybe then people won't act like suicide is this impulsive decision that can somehow get better with time.

The very simple idea that other people have brains different than yours and perceive and react to the same stimuli differently is almost a foreign concept to you. Most likely the problems you're mentioning that are practically fixable are just surface level symptoms of problems that aren't.

Giving up on love,2653648,lamargue,"Sep 1, 2024 at 8:07 AM","suicide is an inviolable right. you shouldn't need to be 'good enough' considering that suicide requires a great deal of planning in thought and execution, as is evidenced by the great number of people who express wishes to commit suicide, yet cannot on grounds of having insufficient means or control of their current circumstances. there is a difference between ideation and execution. if you are seriously considering going through with the act, it's probable to assume that they are truly afflicted by whatever is causing them pain, or feel that there circumstances are far too overpowering to change.
that might be true in some sense. it may not be seen as sufficient reason to kill yourself because your partner broke up with you, and, indeed, there are certainly many issues which are 'fixable.' but who are you to decide what ought and ought not to be sufficient reason for suicide? even if i disagree with the surface level reasoning, there may be deeper problems which i have negated by assumption. of course, this isn't to say that it is true in all cases, but that i am in no way an ideal observer that can determine whether or not a cause of suicide is legitimate or not. i think that we have the tendency to offset our own pain against others in favor of overshadowing them, reducing suffering to a contest. let's be frank: there will always be people suffering more than you, and not all of these people think that suicide is a viable path; but are we obligated then to live, in spite of our own pain? i have a feeling you won't acknowledge this for the case of the terminally alone. there is a hierarchy, sure. but entreating myself to reconsider suicide as a consequence of submitting to someone higher on the echelon of pain should not be seen as anything other than a forceful imposition.
that's why i said that it's a little different in the case of euthanasia, which becomes a policy issue. it's pretty clear that you're hellbent on grossly oversimplifying and misrepresenting the argument, though i'm going to appeal to my better judgement and assume that something in the past has distorted your view of relationships as being something which can solve your issues.
it doesn't apply to relationships since there are standards which we are hardwired to, such as basic forms of attraction being a criterion for which to pursue partners, which is true of both sexes. it doesn't help anyone if you merely resort to dating someone who you aren't attracted to. i'm not arguing for incels, since they are irrelevant to the discussion, so i'll desist in claiming that there are those who are unattractive to all people.

yes, you can easily hire hookers to prostitute themselves, but that doesn't resolve any underlying issues. it's pretty clear that sex itself isn't the sole issue for the terminally alone. it's related to a whole gamut of desires, such as that of intimacy, affection, etc., all of which are consummated to some degree in sexual activity, and thus never truly independent of it. but sex can lack all of these things if for the sole intent of pleasure alone. so no, you are wrong in saying that hookers will fix anything. moreover, it's probably a very bad idea to tell men who seek codependency to first turn to mindless sexual activity.
a surprisingly redpilled idea. i thought that you would cling to the idea that personality is what determines your success, and not necessarily looks, which many women claim are not as important as the former. well, this argument is effectively useless considering i don't actually believe that looks are everything. i do acknowledge that they are necessary for making the initial step, and there are natural screening processes which occur in any environment where both sexes interact.

i understand the argument you are trying to make, and i respectively disagree. i'm not saying that relationships will cure your depression, nor should a partner be depended on to provide them with means of recovery. the discontent that a person feels when they are not in a relationship is really a discontent with their level of social fitness; are these people not allowed to complain? the very nature of their problem is that they are unable to enter into relationships due to deeper concerns. if you hand them a partner on a silver platter, obviously it won't cure their issues. but you can't argue that a lack of relationships is insufficient reason for suicide whilst also claiming that they ought not to enter into them due to their own issues. ""just fix your problems!"" is to assume that these are inessential, surface-level issues. what about those who are physically disabled, and hence unable to find partners? or those who have crippling social anxiety, or other issues which may make social interaction ineluctable and futile? ""well, i've seen people with these issues overcome them,"" is almost equivalent to saying to the clinically depressed ""it sucks that you're suffering, but there are people like you who have gotten better, so you should too."" so, individuals are seen as lazy, uncooperative and cowardly for not choosing the path of improvement, despite non-trivial issues. this seems to veil a particularly ""pro-life"" attitude, a phrase i don't like to use but is amply descriptive of your kind of thinking.

well, let's assume that you have actually considered these cases, and that they are exceptions to your rule. in general, those who possess no debilitating or life-altering maladies which would normally private any access to the dating market, are seen as individuals who can fix their issues, but simply choose not to, partly out of delusion or something else. again, you make far too many assumptions on what has driven an individual into chronic loneliness.

i reject the claim entirely that if a person's threshold for happiness is entering into a relationship then other issues should be addressed; that is, relationships should not be the saving grace in your life. again, you are in no position to determine what people ought and ought not to value, especially when the need to enter into relationships is an essential biological imperative. never claim what people ought to desire, considering that relationships in general are seen as pivotal to leading a good life. it's not true in all cases, but it's a view that is quite generally held, hence why we have institutions such as marriage in the first place. who are we to judge those consigned to the values of society, which are inescapable?

romantic relationships and friendships offer different forms of value. do you have evidence that friendships are more important in the long-term than romantic partners? again, there are things that friendship cannot offer, such as intimacy and the entire gamut of attributes relating to sex. and clearly you don't understand the value of sex as corresponding with a general level of social fitness, which is why i claimed before that prostitutes won't amend this fundamental issue. i'll copy paste something i wrote in another thread, since i think it's pertinent:

""the term 'virgin' is just a neat little contraction of a gamut of socially undesirable attributes, often conflated and seen as causative of virginity. i agree that few really care whether or not you are a virgin. but overall virginity indicates a failure of some sort, and an individual cannot be blamed for rightfully believing that his values are consigned to the social contract. again, the danger is in privation of contractual forms of social engagement, which basically means that attributes which are identifiable with virginity will derive from some root cause, and that both the function and identification of these traits will lead to social disengagement or prejudice.""
don't assume that just because you don't value their concerns that others ought not to as well. this essentially is reducible to a strong pro-life position, which is contrary to the aims of this site. ""well, i've suffered more than you, and i think life is precious! therefore you're a coward for wanting the easy way out when i lived through the pain of my life.""
it's pretty clear that you've suffered a great deal, and i'm sorry for that. but in the future, try not to project your issues onto others.
i also don't know what you mean when you say that people pander to the chronically alone, which somehow undermines the concerns of those who you view are suffering more. when? where? how? i really can't fathom this argument. even if you want to introduce a hierarchy of pain outside of the context of euthanasia for god knows what fucking reason, i'm still of the belief that the threshold of sufficient reason to commit suicide includes chronic loneliness. it's a personal choice, after all.
well, it isn't a competition. that's an absurd claim. the endgoal is the same; we aren't competing over who has more of a right to die, except in cases of euthanasia where it becomes a policy issue. and no, enforcing your view will not change how people perceive suicide. it will always be considered a cardinal sin. so, if that's the case, why should you care how people view it, if you yourself aim to commit suicide? i'm sure it isn't because you want to shoulder a certain kind of heroism in the act. suicide will always be maligned for the harm that it brings to people related to the suicide victim. in essence, to take your argument to its logical conclusion, only those who are perceived as having the greatest reason for committing suicide should be permitted to do so, in order so that social norms can begin to accept it as something that is not necessary malignant, despite the harm that it may bring to others. that to me sounds like a naive utopia that you've built, though i could very well be strawmanning your original intent.
but chronic loneliness fundamentally derives from mental issues? i really don't know enough about the biological origins of depression and anxiety, but let's not argue that these are all hardwired, unchanging features of our neurotypes. refer to my argument previously over those who have improved from these conditions looking at those who suffer the same conditions, sans the will to life, with contempt. i'm almost certain that there are those who have recovered from depression and anxiety, despite suffering suicidal ideation, and have gone on to lead meaningful, productive lives.

i have a headache and am quite inarticulate at the moment. i chose to abstain from mentioning what i personally believe to be the key failure in chronic loneliness, that being functional incompatibility on a social level: in other words, the deterministic nature of personality being devoid of socially desirable qualities locking an individual into circumstances which private the possibility of relationships. i personally view personality as independent of our own wishes and built out of immutable characteristics which are inarticulable and hence not subject to conscious change. but that wasn't needed here, i guess.",2653420,2653420,2653420,2653420,2653420,2653420,2653420,2653420,2653420,,,,

For example I challenge anyone to tell me why I have to live , why I have to have children, why do I have to accept pain and suffering and problems and work? There is no reason. I wonder what these prolifers would say to that challenge . why do I have to live and suffer since I'm going to die anyway no matter what? Why suffer for years and then be tortured to death and die anyway when I can take a drink and end this torture today? I'm going to die either way but if I don't suicide I'll be tortured to death

Nothing matters except avoiding extreme pain. It's the only thing I want to do and no one can tell me I have to live or watch youtube or have children or work or watch news or do anything

Plus I want to die. Even if I were a billionaire healthty young all the elements of a ""good"" life I would still want non-existence asap . I don't want anything from this evil life and evil world

My most traumatic experience is impossible for anyone to take seriously,2635946,RosebyAnyName,"Aug 17, 2024 at 4:21 PM","When I was a kid, another boy asked me if he could touch my breasts. We were both maybe 6-7 years old / the same age. I was too afraid to say no, so I said yes. Afterwards I felt so disgusted with myself that I cried the rest of the night. It still paralyzes me to this day.

Everyone I've told, including family, friends, and medical professionals / therapists, reacted stupidly or minimized it. ""He just liked you,"" ""it's just playing doctor,"" ""what he did was normal and your reaction was abnormal,"" ""why would he wanted to touch your breasts? You were a kid, you didn't have breasts that young."" I even saw a similar story online, and everyone sided with the boy and said the girl was delusional / crazy for being upset and that ""she's overreacting"" and ""she just had a lot of healing to do.""

I feel like I was sexually assaulted, I hate my body, I don't trust anyone, I don't even trust my own judgement anymore, I have entire hours, days, sometimes weeks where I'm just paralyzed thinking about it, and nobody gives a shit. I'm not even allowed to hate him for putting me in that situation because he was also a child and I said yes, and the consensus I've heard for that type of situation is that he's absolved of all responsibility. It literally was 100% my fault so I have nobody to blame but myself. I hate myself for this, and it feels like I'm the only one stupid enough to have made a decision like that.

Nobody irl has ever taken me seriously. I don't get to have people tell me ""it's not my fault"" like in cases of actual sexual assault because it really is my fault, or that ""my feelings matter"" because they actually don't, or that ""I did the best I could in that situation"" because I didn't. All of my suffering is my own fault and I just can't take the shame and guilt anymore. I know if I ever told anyone else, they'd just side with the boy and think I'm stupid.

I want to believe that society is at fault for not doing a better job at helping me stand up for myself, but that's kind of a ridiculous thing to expect, and other kids didn't seem to have the same issues with autonomy compared to me.

I guess the most frustrating part is sometimes it feels like, for every time I was taught about stranger danger and ""just say no"" and all that, I was taught a hundred other times from my parents and teachers, and from the media's depictions of girls, to always accommodate others. I remember being young and feeling like maintaining boundaries was too difficult and not worth the arguments it caused.

I'm interested.

You're not alone. And your feelings are valid and important. You do not need to read stories and find people who understand how you feel to know your feelings are worthy and valid. They already are. <3 I take it seriously. I get it.

I had that thing too where I thought that my life should have been more traumatizing for me to be feeling this way, but that's not how trauma works. Trauma has two sides: your physical body/mind/brain and the experience itself. We might just happen to have a physical body/mind/brain that is more susceptible to trauma. That still makes our trauma very valid. Someone isn't stronger for just happening to be born with a better physical body/mind/brain that doesn't get traumatized as easily. It doesn't mean that there is something wrong with US. If others had our body/mind/experiences, they would react the exact same. Our reactions are normal and valid. The first thing we need to do is give ourselves some self love. We have these wacko brains and bodies. The last thing we need to do is shame ourselves. <3",2635946,,,,,,,,,,,,

Feeling like it's my fault, shifting the blame, seeking help from people who are ill equipped to really ""reach"" the pain and undo it...

In my own experience, the weirdest thing is, all those beliefs and thoughts can shift around on their own when the underlying pain is gone.
It's a conundrum like the chicken or egg; is it the beliefs causing the feelings, or the feelings causing the beliefs?

Have done a few hundred hours of EMDR. I can vouch that it does work.
Major caveat being, it works as well as you are able to feel safe and/or trust a skilled provider to guide you.
This can be circumvented somewhat with the Flash technique (which was invented by an EMDR master).

Flash is incredibly safe, easy and pleasant compared to standard protocol EMDR (which can cause serious retraumatization if done poorly without guidance).
Flash is what EMTs learn some places in the world, to treat emergent psychological shock traumas.

You can try it online and experience that it does move your perception of distress around the trauma from say 9/10 to 6/10 in 10 minutes. Knowing that, you have proof you can heal. Knowing it's not permanent can do wonders for mental health.",2636074,,,,,,,,,,,,

My most traumatic experience is impossible for anyone to take seriously,2648599,uglyugly,"Aug 28, 2024 at 9:25 AM","I'm a survivor of sexual abuse that occurred mainly between ages 3-9. If you were uncomfortable with what was going on, then it was not ok. The abuse is not/was not your fault. I'm guessing most people who have responded to you (outside of this site I mean) are considering the boy's age and seeing him as a child as well, but why would a child that age be acting out sexually? That is absolutely not normal. Kids 6 and 7 rarely tend to act out sexually unless they themselves had been molested. So, just being on the outside, I am guessing part of the reason why you were so uncomfortable was his intention, which I am sure you could feel. What you described does not sound like someone playing doctor, it sounds like he reenacted abuse he experienced or witnessed. Please know that I am NOT excusing his behavior in any way, shape or form. Regardless of the reason he did it, what he did was not ok at all!

I understand the self hatred, the body hatred, and the shame of being abused. It took me years in a group for sexual abuse survivors to understand it was not my fault. It took a hell of a lot of work, but I am on the other side of that mountain now. I still hate my body, but now it's because I am old and it is failing me.

The worst thing my abuser did to me wasn't the sexual abuse, it was making me think I was crazy for ""over reacting"" to the abuse. He taught me not to trust my own instincts, observations and beliefs. But he was and is still wrong, and so is the boy who did that to you. Please trust yourself, your instincts and your interpretation of that event. No one can get it unless they have been in that situation, but just because others don't get it doesn't mean it didn't have a lasting impact. You have every right to think and feel what you do.

To be honest, it's the sort of thing I would have just let happen too because I was quite a timid and accomodating child. It really wasn't your fault. It's hard to really blame him either being that young. Although, you have to wonder what his parents were like. The fact that he asked you beforehand suggests to me that he did realise it wasn't something you just do to someone. That they may in fact object to it. I don't know. Just seems so off to me. But then, children are sexualised so young now. I find it really disturbing to be honest. Although, I'm terribly prudish I guess.

I think it's terrible that no one has given you the sympathy you deserve. Regardless of where to place the blame- definitely not on you but it's complicated- him being so young too. But, of course this would have been traumatic for you. Really, anything that is deeply upsetting someone should be taken seriously by others.

Thank you for your kind words.

I feel like, in my mind, it's not just that one boy did something bad to me, or that I didn't have the support systems I needed to help understand my experiences, it's that everyone else in my life ""sided with him."" My own parents ""sided"" with a random boy instead of their own daughter, therapists ""sided"" with him instead of their own client who paid to be there, etc. People always focused on him, his behaviour, why he acted that way (and why what he did is actually normal and I should get over myself). When has anyone in my life (outside this forum) ""sided"" with me? Or asked about what I was feeling or why I reacted how I did in that situation? Why aren't people justifying my experiences?

Which leads me to...

This hits the nail on the head. My support system felt superficial, even when I was young I might have felt ""safe"", but never ""secure"". I didn't fully know why at the time, but I'm starting to see it now as an adult. I felt like, because I was a girl, I was told I'm special, untouchable, wanted and beloved, except when something bad happened, in which case it wasn't his fault and he was also just a kid, don't be a bad girl, don't act out, stop talking about it and get over yourself.

Need to break into my abusive dads car,2629100,they forgot me,"Aug 12, 2024 at 2:29 PM","I have long come to the conclusion that ctb is the best option for me. I live with my abusive family and I am very chronically ill/disabled so I have basically no autonomy. My dad has guns and a few of them are in his car. I can remember the exact model or whatever but I know that he has either a 45 or 40 beretta in the car and more ammo. From the research I've done that will work with a shot through the mouth. I will check the clip to see if the bullets are flat points and see if in his extra ammo he has any hallowpoints.

The only problem is getting into the car. The best way would be night when they are all asleep bc they are very controlling of me. But my dads keys are always in the pocket of his jacket or pants and I would have to sneak into my parents room hoping they're soundly asleep enough not to wake up while I get the keys. Also his car keys are attached to a TON of other keys (he is a landlord) so makes a lot of noise and harder to get out of pocket while trying to be quiet. then i would have to sneak downstairs and go out to the garage and open the garage (another point with noise that could possibly wake someone up).

I thought about trying to get into the car buy breaking a window but his car is a lexus with laminated glass and likely even the back windows are laminated glass so that would be very hard to break. Also in case I bitch out him, having a broken window would be EXTREMELY bad.

So I was hoping maybe someone would know another way to break into a car.

-bags & ropes etc

I will also like to add that i probably cant do anything that will leave scars or obvious evidence on my self if it happens to fail again ( I have been left with deep rope gashes one too many times from attempted hangings along with a whole face of petechia for 4 days unfortunately)

Ive looked at the resources mega thread and have attempted many of them to no avail, such as the night night method, shallow water black out, and partial suspension hanging.

i desperately need to die but i literally keep surviving everything... Im not even exaggerating ive taken 2 pong pong seeds, had two whole bottles of Benadryl, passed out while hanging from a noose due to compressed air and was out for 5 mins and woke up, injected 20 mLs of air into my veins & 1mL into the jugular vein, along with a painfully long laundry list of other attempts. Im sorry that this has kind of become a rant but please i beg of you, if you have any ideas please let me know ive never been more desperate in my life i wish i could do firearms but im not 21 so thats not an option. all i want is a way that i can finally just die without an extraordinarily long painful demise.

if you've made it this far thank you for reading and please, let me know if you have any ideas on what i could do ):",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Are you going to leave a note? +vent,2623509,rotten,"Aug 7, 2024 at 5:21 PM","When you decide to ctb, will you leave a note behind for your family, significant other, or friends?

I don't really plan on leaving one unless I can ensure it will only be kept between a few friends and not my family. I doubt that would happen though. I know that sounds harsh but I never had the best relationship with my family.

When I was about 14 years old I got caught at school for having suicidal thoughts (my friend snitched). They sent me to the crisis center which I fucking hated because nobody listened to what I was saying. It was like I wasn't even in the room at times. Anyways, after being there for who knows how long, I changed my mind on ctb for the time being. I had my note stuffed in my underwear for safe keeping. I told the nurse to take me to the bathroom and from there I tore up the note, threw it in the trash can, and then buried everything with used paper towels.

These motherfuckers really found all the pieces, put it together, and then sent a neat little photocopy to my parents.

I know now to flush things like that but back then I was 14, stupid, and out of it.

My mother held that note over my head for a solid year. She would basically use it as a form of blackmail. If I didn't do this or if I did something she didn't like, she would threaten to send my note to everyone that way they can make fun of me and see how ""crazy"" I am.

Eventually one day my mom had to leave for the afternoon. It was a rare occasion where I was left in the house all by myself since my incident. I went into her closet and took that photocopy along with other paperwork from the crisis center and flushed it down the toilet. I didn't find the original though, I think the center still had it or threw it away by now. I was also lucky my parents aren't tech savvy so I'm pretty sure they never made more copies.

So for that, I don't think they deserve a final note from me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Goodbye feat. IC SN and olanzapine & random musings,2651489,tary,"Aug 30, 2024 at 10:59 AM","I will be drinking 25 g of SN from IC mixed into 50 ml of water in 8 hours (just started fasting).
I'll also make a second backup glass, conveniently there's exactly 50 g of SN in one of the three bags I have.
I will use olanzapine as an antiemetic, it has nearly the same dopamine blocking antiemetic quality as metoclopramide, but without the quicker stomach emptying.
I have seen it recommended in SN guides though, so might as well try it and see if it works now that I have it at hand.
I will bump this thread after drinking the first glass, and will attempt to post if I vomit.
If I don't come back for a week, I'll most likely have succeeded.

Now for random thoughts:

It's been a nice 2 years to be a member of this community. I like the honesty and freedom of thought, and the supportiveness.
I also like the old-school forum feel, reminds me of the time of smaller Internet communities (not that SaSu is small) before the rise of mass social media.
I'm thankful that I've found SN through this forum, without it I would've probably painfully hanged myself in public (at night) or stabbed myself to death.
I have been suicidal since my teens, and have known since age 16 that I would eventually die by my own hand.
I just don't like life in general, it doesn't feel worth the effort it takes to live, and I've grown bored of it as I've grown older (I'm only 32, but still )
I feel like I've seen and done enough, and that from now on it would be just more of the same for the next half-century with everything that comes with an aging body and brain past their prime.
There's a nice expression in my native Finnish: ""ajasta ikuisuuteen"", or ""from time to eternity"", meaning death.
I believe in an afterlife, but I'm not afraid of anything, I've read enough to convince me that it's nothing to worry about, even for a suicide.
We're at home in the universe. Everyone dies someday, it's not a thing that puts you in any danger of pain or hurt, it's just another transition in an existence with plenty more before and after it.
I feel almost excited, as if I was moving to another country or something. I've consciously done things recently knowing they'll be the last time I'll ever do them.
I'm sure many many people who've known they'll die soon have felt the same before me. It must be a very human experience.
Thank you, SaSu, for everything and see you on the other side.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

CTB Concern: Jumping into River,2652242,M0nolith,"Aug 30, 2024 at 10:46 PM","Hello, I have officially lost all hope of anything in my life getting better. I have lost all the willpower I had to keep going. I've realized that I am just not capable of making it in this world, i'm too sensitive, too afraid.

I've been fantasizing about it for awhile, and now it actually seems possible.

I live close to a river, it is very big. What are my chances if I take an absurd amount of a benzo (Specifically Alprazolam), and jump into the river using the bridge. I cannot swim.

I am terrified, but living is so hard and shit isn't going to get better. I now realize that there is something wrong with me, and that I can't fix it, nor can anyone else.

I feel so much guilt, but I see it as my only escape.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
CTB Concern: Jumping into River,2652245,sweetcreep,"Aug 30, 2024 at 10:49 PM","if no one sees you, it most likely will work. not knowing how to swim will help you. drowning just seems so scary to me, not trying to come off as judgmental or anything. it's a real fear of mine, haha.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
CTB Concern: Jumping into River,2652247,_AllCatsAreGrey_,"Aug 30, 2024 at 10:54 PM","I'm sorry you're suffering in this way.

Bridge over water is a method I consider often. Height is a major consideration. Do you know the height of your bridge? Not being able to swim is a big factor. Do you have more info on the size of the river? Use of weights can be helpful - like heavy backpack. Be selective of time of day. If there are many witnesses it can decrease success. Benzos will be helpful for managing SI, which is a big issue with this method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
CTB Concern: Jumping into River,2652266,Alexei_Kirillov,"Aug 30, 2024 at 11:29 PM","I'd recommend weights using the formula 1029kg/m3 x (your bodyweight in kilos / 900kg/m3). So if you weigh 70kg, 1029 x (70/900) = 80kg, meaning you would need to carry another 10kg to make yourself sink. You could feasibly do it with much less but this gives you some leeway.

Be aware that the hardest part about this method is not the drowning aspect, but the jumping, even if it's from a short drop. All the preparation in the world (getting the right amount of weights, securing them to yourself in such a way that even if you were panicking, you couldn't get them off, etc.) is useless if you're unable to make the leap.

If you can make the leap, though, then I personally think this is a very good method. I would read this paper on the experience of drowning to know what to expect, though the benzos would impact your experience.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To be absolutely honest, the psychiatric hospitals in the UK are a disgrace.

You might want to talk about all the positive plans and points of action you have to actually live life and even some enjoyable activities. Remember that they both have to agree for you to be sectioned.

Personally I have always refused to engage with SPA, crisis team, HTT and the psychiatrists are also a complete waste of time and find them quite triggering.

I really hope that everything works out for you, kittyswift. You might need to do some positive acting - also when they show up, they will also assess cleanliness of the property, self care etc. So you might want to prepare all of those as well. Have some healthy good laid out, pleasantries etc. Just theatrics to try and keep them at bay.

I can't die with partial hanging, it's my only option, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I feel a sense of urgency and need to die, but I can't find a reliable way to make me pass out without my body bailing out at the last second.

I live in an inn. If I'm going to die with partial, it absolutely needs to happen tonight because the rent that I cannot pay is due. I cannot bring myself to die without being completely isolated but I feel like knowing that I'm such a fuck up I'm not going to get what I want.

My anchor point is a suspended coat rack that's bolted high and can hold my body weight. I'm using a paracord with a clove hitch attached to the bar and a slipknot on the end. I folded a blanket and pillow as a mat for kneeling. I remember constantly adjusting my rope so that Its in a position where if I'm kneeling without pushing my head down, my oxygen flow should still be cut off by some amount, but not all. Is that what I'm doing wrong? I'm going to post my setup when I can, I still feel lethargic from earlier so I'm not going to include it in this post.

For my first attempt I knelt down, with the rope clutching my neck tightly. About 10 seconds passed before everything turned to static, the music going through my earbuds would get softer, but I was still conscious. Eventually I stopped breathing but I could still see the light from my phone screen, although blurry. I thought I was doing everything right and that this was it, but my body slumped to the side and the slipknot came undone. I couldn't breathe for a few seconds, then I started thrashing about and spitting uncontrollably. It felt like a seizure even though I've never experienced it. I woke up 30 minutes later, remembering mostly everything but feeling fatigued. The other two attempts didn't come close to the first one. I could still hear music, I was aware of my surroundings. The only thing I felt like was supposed to happen was that feeling of blood rushing to my head.

I have no fucking clue what i'm doing. I go through thread after thread, apparently you're supposed to pass out after 3-7 seconds? What the fuck? What the fuck am I supposed to be looking for? Am I even supposed to be remembering any of this if done right? Why is it not just as simple as a rope around my fucking neck? What part about this is ""painless"" or ""peaceful""?

I told my brother about one of my deepest darkest secret. (WARNING: DISTURBING),2652444,IBM0000,"Aug 31, 2024 at 5:05 AM","M, 21. I just told my little brother about a secret that I was willing to cite as one of the reasons I wanted to ctb. If you don't want to hear what a rapist has to say, please skip this post all-together.

Before I start, I'd really love give the credit to this community. In particular a trans woman. I shared my darkest secret with you all and you have only been sweet, caring and accepting. I won't say that you weren't shocked, you were. In a sign of her trust, she shared that her brother, reached a point where she didn't care if he died, but actually wanted for him to die because of how he ruined her life. I didn't want to become like that brother.

But that's besides the point. It all transpired less than an hour as of time of writing so I am still trying to process it all. I just want to get into it.

Backstory, this is essential for a quick understanding of my situation. I grew up in a semi-strict religious family in a ME country. As you all know, anything shameful is frowned up to be spoken. Let alone anything that is considered immoral. Immorality is basically the worst thing that you can do in a close-knit muslim country. Your family's standing depends on it. It's all things I didnt really understand nor really cared to until a few weeks ago.
This paints a grim picture for what I am about to say right now. I was a highly sexual kid, for some reason, I don't know why. I don't know how. But during my childhood. I did extremely immoral and sexual things to my young siblings. 2boys, 2 girls. This part is going to be extremely disgusting for you all next but I just want you to understand that I didn't do it. My life was like on auto pilot. To say I don't have any thoughts over the past 5 years of these reallllly shitty things is a lie. No one is perfect but that is no excuse. When we were playing, I fully clothed raped my little brother. Who was also clothed. Involving my other little brother, he and I did it. No penetration, that was too disgusting even for me, I guess, or I just didnt know how or what it was. I even remember him doing it with my young cousin too, same thing no penetration. My little sister, I tried to rape her when she was asleep, maybe? I think I may have kissed her when she was asleep though. I dont really remeber it much, I was far too young. Or maybe I didn't actually rape her. I don't even know. My other little sibling, however, I did try to rape. In the pantry, where I led her. Thinking about it all, the only reason why I didnt kill myself was because I am a coward, and my excuse was that my family would find out that I intentionally killed myself and our family would suffer because of the reputation of having someone who ctb'ed in their family. I obviously changed now. Up until a year, maybe half, all I wanted was to ctb. I just gave up on studies. The pandemic hit, it excarbated my mental health issues. I was extremely anti-social in school. They though I was special needs. In a way, I was. It made it impossible for my suicidal self to actually study and I failed. My family had me take it again and I failed.
I then did nothing for basically two years. Except for a part-time security job for three months.
Annnd here we are today. I gave up on the short-term suicide plan. I realized I was too cowardish and my family had too much to lose for me if I died. And I really wanted to make up for all the really batshit things I basically had no control over that I did.

Today, (Sat, Aug, 31 of 2024).
Now that we are here, we arrived at today. I was heading out and my little brother, the one who I raped, I was talking to. He was helping me take things to my car. (Dad's car but I was basically given it). I wanted to do it, I wanted to confess for a long time about what I did to him. He had started to become reactionary and I saw the signs of self-hate start to take its terrible toll on him in the form of racist and purely sadisitc behaviour. I just didn't want him to hate me and hate himself or reach a massive melting point like the sweet trans woman on here. I said it, I just slowly, roundaboutly said it, but he was like. ""SAY IT, I wont be offended. I wont get upset"" So I did...I couldn't believe what I just did, but....HE WAS NONCHALANT. He was shocked, I felt it. But he WAS OVER-ALL NON. CHALANT. AND...In exchange, he told me shocking shit....The cousin that's married to my sister? (Yeah, we're fucked up like that...Shouldn't be a surprise but I feel a little shocked now thag I write it down) Thought he wasn't involved, he came to visit. He also did that shit when he was young. I was shocked myself. He told me that this shit...it was all in the past, when we were kids. He was...Just like you guys, accepting albeit shocked. I even told him that about my other little brother. And that the other young cousin shit. He was shocked about that. I guess he didn't know it....I asked him: ""Well...Would you have yold anyone about this?"" He said. ""No way."" And...I just feel so great. I feel that I saved one of my little siblings.

What does this mean for my future, and what others could learn (if you read all the way through).

I want to reveal it to all my little siblings whom I hurt. Starting from the ones who will react the least badly up to....My little sister (youngest sibling) whom I tried to rape in the pantry. Thank god my mom came in and interrupted me before I did anything. But doesnt mean I didnt try. I would've probably done something had my mom not come in.. She's the youngest so she might tell everyone. But I want to, I can't let het become twisted or depressed and end up like me, not to anyone. And I want to finish high school I want to get a job. Take care of my sweet family. Donate to good causes, try to change the suffocating atmosphere. the political atmosphere in this nation...I have opened my eyes to life but I am still in a really fragile moment because it could all just crumble, and that's fine because I will have ctb'ed like I always wanted to. And to everyone out there, struggling...Hiding dark and painful secrets....Wallowing in complete and utter despair....You have to try, to try to slowly build up your courage to do it. If you can. Because while I have had a really priviliged life, not having had to work at all even, I was totally and utterly depressed. Life had no meaning. But each year I would move the suicide day up to another year.

Sorry if this sucks, first post. Please ask me anything. Or insult me. It's fine. Thank you so much for reading. This was basically the baggae I was carrying and yall are a godsend. :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I too had sexual urges from my childhood, now that i think about it, its like i was a demon in the midst of children at that age. My father and mother got divorced when i was 5 and my mother ctb then i was raised by my grandparents and my aunt. My aunt has a child who is 6 years younger than me. when i was 12 Once me and my cousin did the oral thing, there was no penetration, it was just once i didn't know why i did it and why was my mind so fucked up like that. One day my friend who was 3 years older than me tried to convince me that my cousin should do oral with him and the saddest part is i tried convincing my cousin to do it, fortunately she didn't but later that evening he r'ed her and i could never forget myself for that ever. Everytime i try to be happy, this incident makes me feel like i don't deserve that. Till this day i regret it, all i could think now is to runaway from home after two years or just ctb. I feel like i deserve no place in their home or in this world. What should i do, should i apologise or just hope that she never tells anyone about it.

I told my brother about one of my deepest darkest secret. (WARNING: DISTURBING),2652990,EvisceratedJester,"Aug 31, 2024 at 4:15 PM","First off, what you did wasn't rape. Rape involves forced sexual intercourse, or in other words, penetrating or being penetrated without your consent or when you are in a situation where you cannot properly give consent (such as if you are very drunk or very high on drugs). What you did would still be sexual assault, but it wouldn't be rape.

Secondly, what you did was wrong and unforgivable, but you were also a child. You may even have been too young to even understand what sex is. You shouldn't be holding yourself to the same standards that adults who do things like this are held to. You likely didn't even understand that your actions were bad in the first place. In this particular situation, you need to be a bit more understanding of your past self. This does make me a bit concerned since you described being hypersexual back then, which could potentially point to you having past sexual trauma. This would explain your actions too.

I'm glad that you were able to have a conversation with your brother about it and I think you should see a professional about this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I told my brother about one of my deepest darkest secret. (WARNING: DISTURBING),2653047,IBM0000,"Aug 31, 2024 at 5:17 PM","It's a middle eastern country. Therapy doesn't exist here in most forms. Nor would it be good for my family's standing, as standing is everything in a nepotistic country such as this. Heck, accessible therapy doesn't exist in most developed countries. Plus, I think therapists in a country such as this won't be operating on a non-judgemental, purely agnostic work basis because of how religious this country is and even if they weren't judging, they may not speak my language at all. It's just what I'd love from the future in this country. But it's a US-controlled puppet.
First of all, I just want to tell you that it's a very brave and a great start to tell ANYONE about this at all. I did it, and I never regretted it today. People here are so sweet and caring and accepting....And shocked, yes. But mainly the former half. I think you should learn from my story. Build up your courage, as you interact with her on a normal basis, try to find the best opportunity to tell her about that. While the two of you are talking, She is in a not-so-bad mood. And either one is about to head out for an extended amount of time. This is how it happened for me. I told my little brother about it as I was being helped out with my stuff as I had stayed at my parent's house for the weekend. And I just couldn't bare the thought of continuing this torture. Knowing that what I did could be mentally torturing on him. I had to confess at a certain point, and I was planning on it but I guess I just winged it at that moment. I don't really know how, but he was understanding. Point being, you have to give up on killing yourself in the short-term. I.E. 2 years. If you want to do it, you may want to wait for 5 years before you do it, if you decide to do it. And you have to accept yourself. You have to somewhat forgive yourself, leave the rest for the other to forgive you.
If you can't ctb as easily as you'd like, you have a reason to stay alive. Whether it be helping your family and/or helping the world. I want you to learn from the trans woman who hated her brother's guts. She wanted him dead, really. He sexually abused her when she was young and she hates his guts, albeit with other different reasons...He was a terrible brother over-all. This is a cautionary tale, I guess. Since you really love your cousin and your family, you have to tell them about it. You have to build up your courage in order to tell her. You can take it at your pace and if you are willing to really live in the short-term, you should ease your with that as well.
Thank you so much for your take. I realize that while technically it's not rape, it may as well have been. Even if there was no penetration. I did it. Without his consent. And, while I may have been a child, I was much older than him. About 5-6 years older. And even if it was sexual assault, a lesser form of rape, it was still on my little brother. And I appreciate that you point out how unforgivable and wrong it is. I have really struggled with trying to forgive myself, I still don't really do. And I also had terrible mental health as a result, not being able to either ctb nor live. I was stuck in this stupid limbo in which I wouldn't repent for my actions nor escape and stop wasting their love and resources on me. Yes. I was a child. But to claim that I didn't know bad from good and that sexual assault was wrong, is wrong. Because I remember crying about it. I remember about how I just wanted to kill myself and how disgusting it was that I had done something so terrible. Meaning, I was not as young to be able to claim that I didn't understand what I did was wrong or right. Even the pantry shit and how I led my little sister there, I knew it was wrong and yet I still did it. I don't know why, I am not just born evil though that's one thing. Nobody is. Yes. I was hypersexual as a kid, I guess I remember my childhood having hypersexual young family members too, which feels incredibly wrong. And even if it explained it, even if I was a kid, even if I was really molested as a child like all those other family members, I won't claim I am innocent of anything even if I was the product of my family's shitty hidden sexual abuse environment. I noticed, one time, that my uncle would have a hard time looking at me when I came to visit. He's a married man. They described him as ""weird"" growing up. I rarely see him, and I don't think he did it. I just subconsciously want to put the blame on someone for whatever the hell was going on we were young. Could it be a family curse? All of us are just fucked to eternal hidden sexual abuse on young family members who would grow up and do the same and I have only inherited that shit? Or is it just a unique situation that no family ever goes through. I am leaning towards option 3. It does happen, and it's not just me. But men, women, all of us are afraid to speak out and tell out stories. Not even online, let alone in real life to them. Thank you.",2652826,2652955,2652990,,,,,,,,,,

I told my brother about one of my deepest darkest secret. (WARNING: DISTURBING),2653199,EvisceratedJester,"Aug 31, 2024 at 7:32 PM","Even if you were around 5 to 6 years older than him, you were still a child. Feeling disgusted or upset over your actions or the actions of others isn't the same as having a proper in-depth understanding of why something is wrong. Most children do not have a good understanding of why something is wrong, rather they tend to only understand that a certain behaviour made them feel a specific way. You need to be taught why something is wrong. Even if what you did made you feel disgusted with yourself and suicidal, it doesn't mean that you understood the full weight of your actions back then. It usually takes time and experience for it to hit you, so again, don't hold your past self to the same standards you would hold an adult in this situation.

There is a chance that you have had past sexual trauma that you just don't remember. There is also a small chance that you may have just had a naturally high libido. Either way, you can acknowledge the fact that your actions were unforgivable while also acknowledging the fact that you were still a child at the time. You aren't cursed and your family isn't cursed. Some families just happen to have more issues than others as a result of circumstances, such as generational trauma. The best thing you can do is try to learn from your past actions and try to be a better person. Constantly shaming yourself and treating yourself like a monster isn't going to change the past and isn't going to help you in the long run. It can even potentially lead to you going down the wrong path, leading to you harming yourself and others. What you did was horrible, but people harm each other to varying degrees and that is sadly just a part of life. You are not a monster, just a person. Sometimes, the only thing you can do is try to be better. If you don't feel like you are at a point where you could ever forgive yourself then that's fine. You don't have to forgive yourself, but you don't need to constantly beat yourself up either. You feel bad about your past actions and have owned up to them, rather than making up excuses for them and that makes you better than a lot of people out there.",2653047,,,,,,,,,,,,

I give all this love and care only for the men to discard me once they reunite with their ex girlfriend.

When I was 15 I feel in love with this boy in the Cadet club I belonged too. He was a bad boy who was getting into trouble . We were good friends and when he split up with his girlfriend who was also in cadets he got with me and we shared a kiss. When he got back with her he coldy told me I was a ""mistake"". Worst of all when it came out what he did with me he denied everything and painted me as crazy and liar. Some girls in cadets believed me because he did the same to them others in the club believed him and sided with him. In adulthood I have experienced the same too.

When I was at university in my second year I met a guy on campus. He was in final year and studied philosophy. We got so well because we are talking about politics and the fact I gave a MP a hard time during a Q&A session at the university hall when the MP came to vist the University. This guy gave me his number and we began talking. I asked him out to go for drink in the local cafe in university town. We were both messaging each other regularly and then at last minute he cancels our plans because he told me he still has "" feelings for his ex""

The last man I met he was in his f*cking 50s. He made me feel so special in a way no man has ever done it was wonderful having a man give me all this attention and helping me with whatever I needed. I really thought he liked me I then worked out he stopped giving me attention and distancing himself from me because he got back together with his 55 year old on and off girlfriend. They have been on and off for over 20 f*cking years. He has permanently messed up my head in so many ways ( another long story) with his constant lying, mind games, gaslighting. He has a caused me so pain and made me feel worthless and scared to go near another man. This arsehole is one of the reasons why I struggle a lot mentally.

I loved him so much and all I ever was good to him but he just had no care for my feelings and he painted me to be crazy and himself the good guy to our boss and our colleagues at work.

I am so sick and tired of being rebound girl. I actually hate couples who are on and off and get with other people as a filler then reunite with their ex. I f*cking hate couples because they don't care about other people's feelings. I wish these arseholes sort out their own sh*t before getting involved with innocent people because we the rebounds we get hurt and have this pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Another day of doing absolutely nothing, even though I had a lot to do. I don't know why I'm holding out a couple more years to ""get things done"" if I never fucking do anything. I should know better, that's a part of why I want to die. But, it really shouldn't be hard. I had literally one thing to do today. One. Single. Fucking. Thing. I did goddamn nothing all day. I hate doing this, every day is wasted, and it just makes me hate myself more and more. I know stabbing has to be one of the least effective methods, and yet whenever I fuck something up again, I vividly daydream about stabbing myself over and over and over and slowly bleeding to death.

And is there even any hope if I've spent the past few years doing barely anything with my life? I doubt it. I'll probably drop out again or kill myself, or maybe both in that order. I'm so useless.

FleetingNight's Vent Thread,2549382,excellum,"Jun 5, 2024 at 6:16 AM","This sounds a lot like me. I used to internalize a lot of hatred towards myself because I thought changing was so easy, yet I couldn't take the first step. Granted, I'm still not where I want to be, and I still struggle with suicidal ideation, but a lot of the self-hatred ceased once I learned how the human brain works. How our brain functions is not so different from a human 300,000 years ago, as we're pretty much atomically the same - we're still Homo sapiens. The problem is you weren't born 300,000 years ago when all we had to do was find food, play, raise kids, and occasionally we'd come face-to-face with a predator. That is when our fight-or-flight kicked in.

Today this anxiety response gets triggered constantly by thinking about bills, house payments, car payments, worrying about becoming destitute, perceived cultural obligations, degrees, money. Once it is triggered, your brain literally can't tell the difference between that and a physical tiger in front of you, because it doesn't have the capacity to, it's just running code to keep you alive. We're pretty unique though, like you won't find a Zebra suffering from crippling anxiety because a lion might eat them in the future - it's just going to do Zebra things until it has to run away from the lion. I'm not trying to romanticize Paleolithic living, but it's not your fault our culture panned out like this when we're obviously not biologically attuned to it.

This stuff around you evolved, and continues to evolve at light-speed compared to us. You had no control over any of it. Even if someone decides to change, and they find the will to do it, they have no control over their environment and the material quantum fluctuations in their body and brain that bring about that disposition in response. What does that say about praise or punishment? It doesn't make sense. If you want to learn more about that, you can look up determinism. Robert Sapolsky is a neurobiologist that I haphazardly paraphrased here, but I recommend his work.

Learning about this stuff helped me realize I was being unnecessarily hard on myself. It also absolved me of some culpability for how I turned out. Though, at first, I relied too heavily on this perspective as a crutch in order to avoid doing the hard thing. It's very tempting to do that, but my decisions ultimately affect those around me. I don't think free will exists, but society runs as if it does so we have no choice but to pretend and play along. It's on us at the end of the day to subject ourselves to the randomness of the universe and adapt. I hope this didn't come off offensive or tone deaf, I have no idea what your circumstances are and I don't have any easy solutions, but I hope I did ""something"" to help another human being, whatever that is.",2549328,,,,,,,,,,,,

One of the main reasons I have these long breakdowns/episodes/whatever you'd call them and waste hours of my day is just to recover from talking to people. I've just been dissociating and self harming for hours, and it's just because I had to take a phone call for a while. It stressed me out so much, I could hardly control myself for about four hours. I know that's insane. That's why I'm cooked. I started noticing a couple days ago how I can't get anything done after a phone call. I thought at first it was just when the call was serious or heavy, but tonight, it wasn't any of those things. It was pretty simple, even fun at some points. But I felt so overwhelmed I lost control.

How am I ever going to do anything? Can't even talk to someone without dissociating, what's wrong with me?

I think it's a little better with the people I live with, because I have more time to get used to it. I'll have to start keeping track of it, though. It's not like talking to my parents doesn't stress me the hell out, lol.

Is it even possible to get by without talking to people? And why do I LOVE talking online, like here, but lose my fucking mind when I have to call someone?? It makes no sense. Like I've said, I feel like suicide is unavoidable for me, and this is another reason why

If I could take them all, and the pain would stop and I'd fall asleep, I would. Even if I found some pill cocktail that might work, I know I'd just throw them up. It's so tempting to try anyways. I have a lot of meds.

Edit: Researching this and the best that'll happen is even worse pain and maybe a seizure. I wish they could just give me something stronger. It should be my fucking choice how I fucking use it if I pay them for it

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some cliffsides here, not nearby, but I could get there. This might be my new plan. A lot of them are by beaches, which is nice, because I love the beach a lot. I'd be a bit afraid to jump into water, because I'm terrified of drowning, but maybe if it was high enough and I knew the fall would kill me.

Only problem is I'd have a lot of time to think it over on the trip there. If I change my mind, I guess I'd have to explain to my parents why I'm in a city so many miles away. I can by time for the trip there, pretend I'm out somewhere else, but not the trip back.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have no choice but to try and pretend the pain isn't there and work anyways. I can hardly focus, though. I won't even be able to sleep tonight, and I shouldn't have last night. I can't even stop my hands from shaking, so I hope I'll be able to write steadily somehow",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm unironically wondering if my period is a valid enough reason to push me over the edge. It's gross, it's very painful, it messes my emotions up even worse than usual, and I seriously never want to have one again. I'm sick of this happening to me every month. It's like knowing you're going to get a stomach flu every single month for years and not being able to do anything about it. I want a hysterectomy, but I don't know how to trust anyone having access to my body while I'm unconscious, or even while I'm awake, I skip routine checkups because of it

I wonder how many doctors would believe me if I told them any of this, they probably wouldn't take it seriously. No one thinks of periods as something that could seriously effect you, it's either funny, you're overreacting, you're weird for daring to talk about it, or all of the above",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ideation is high after SCOTUS ruling,2579358,jbear824,"Jun 29, 2024 at 4:38 PM","Not sure if anyone here has heard but the SCOTUS of the US has just basically made being homeless illegal, with their decision that cities can ticket/fine people for sleeping outside.

Homeless people don't tend to have a lot of money. Which means a lot of them will fail to pay these fines and essentially be sent to jail, where they will continue to rack up debt they can't pay. And when they are released. Their lack of money and a place to sleep will give them no other option but to become repeat offenders. Sending them right back to jail.

The fact that this is going to happen to me and my partner at some point, since our income combined is not enough to even afford a studio (we can afford it, just wouldn't be able to pay for anything else) is making me want to just check out now.

The US is becoming a fascist theocratic dictatorship and there is nothing can be done to stop it.

I feel very weird after not even 1 second. I feel like my breathing is a little restricted, I can't breath very good but It is bearable.
After 3-5 second my hands are starting to tingle/start to get smth like itchy? another 1-2 second later my visoin starts to get black.
I feel very weird...
After a total of 10 seconds or so I stopped or was ""forced"" to stop cuz my arms are starting to go ""numb"" or smth and I let go
When I let go the feeling continues for 'bout 3 seconds and then it gets better in the next 5 seconds

My mum went mad and started screaming about how social services get involved and complained about how i am bringing problems to the family. As a teenager my mum and grandmother kept giving me so much grief for having self harm scars.

I have anoxeria in my 20s and when my diet pills got discovered my family were making the situation about themselves and the guilt tripping.

Issues like this require someone to really sit and think and especially with the way the world and internet today is there is not a lot encouragement for gathering your thoughts and really thinking about anything.

I told my mom several months ago after my brother hit me and kept trying to beat me up and she didn't care that they make me suicidal and she didn't care about that either.

I'm absolutely in agony, in one month I'm going to be in circumstances that I'm going to have to be around many people, when I say many people and due to my trauma that's getting worse everyday.
Unfortunately 3 of these people are my mom and two siblings and I love them to death and it absolutely tears my heart apart at the thought of not seeing them again, I miss them so much because I've been away from them for 6 months and I just want to hug them so tightly and not let go but I'm afraid I'm not going to be able to do that again.
I don't want to die I just want to live without pain, I'm not even asking for happiness because that's a far stretch, I know I will never feel any kind of joy again but I wish I could just live without this emotional pain, it's torture it unbearable I can't take it anymore and I'm so scared the day is approaching and I'm feeling so many different emotions, I'm scared, sad, lonely, I can't speak to anyone about this I only have you guys.
The thought of putting my mom, who's 80 years old and has been the most amazing mother, who has given everything up for us to always make sure we had everything we needed, always protected us and still does her love is immeasurable, I love her to death and she would never survive me ctbing, I have this huge knot in my throat and so much pain, my heart is filled with pain at the very thought of putting her through that.
I'm bawling right now, I'm so scared, in torture emotionally, so confused, so angry at the universe, I hate the universe I don't understand why good people have to go through so much pain, it's so unfair,
I have so much anger inside and just want to explode I just wish I could push a button and be gone, without causing my mom any pain.

"Scarred, heart broken and alone",2653077,Mirrory Me,"Aug 31, 2024 at 5:44 PM","The universe works weirdly sometimes. For first, something unexpected may go wrong and you may start to stress out about how to fix it, but then there's a solution that is an improvement (for example your old phone temporarily malfunctions so have to you buy a new better one). Or you may feel like some fairy-tale stroke of luck is happening, but you realize that ""it was too good to be true"".

You may never get a direct answer for the universe as to why certain things may happen, but some observation on ""what could have been learned from this"" can perhaps help to conclude some facts.

You can also keep in touch with the universe by following synchronizations, astrology, or reading tarot cards. A person is also able to channel guidance from their subconscious by speaking, journaling, or drawing pictures.

You'd have to have known my mother to understand why she did not fully comprehend that is not something you should say to your child. She was correct, though. I don't know all the details but, I know enough to know this is true. My birth month is exactly nine months from my mother's birth month & I was full term. My mother did tell me once that she had a friend that took her to a bar to celebrate her birthday & that is where she met my father. He married her after I was born. There is even a wedding photo where I am sitting on her lap as a baby. The marriage was not a very happy one. I am fortunate to have had a father that was responsible and did the right thing. I feel guilty that my existence made him so unhappy for so long. I forgive my mother for the way she was. She could not help it.

how do i go about writing a will?,2651455,ham and potatoes,"Aug 30, 2024 at 10:37 AM","So, a couple things here. A will is for what happens to your assets and estate once your dead. It's legally binding. Things like what you want done after your death with your body should be done in a separate ""final wishes"" type thing, as the will is for ""property"" and your body isn't that
So, it really depends on the laws of where you live. Where I live, you have a couple options for writing a will, and all of them can be free.
1- you can type it out, and have you signing it witnessed and signed off by 2 people who are preferably not beneficiarys in the will.
2. You can complete handwrite your will and sigh it. It's called a holographic will.
So look up the laws of your state/province or wherever you live

Scared of dying,2652589,BrandNewWorld,"Aug 31, 2024 at 8:21 AM","I had an interesting childhood, to say the least. My father was a wife beater and used to beat my mom when me and my sister were little kids. We eventually grew up to hate him. Every moment my sister tried to reconcile with him turned disastrous, with him having massive arguments with her very often (even physical, as in him hitting her). I didn't even try to reunite the family. I have always thought that he was a lost case and our relationship couldn't be repaired.
As of late I have been acting like my dad, a lot. I hit my sister yesterday and she blurted out, ""you're just like your dad, aren't you?"", my mum says that to me a lot as well when I do something that reminds her of him. I have always promised myself that if I will grow up to be a person like him, I will kill myself. Some things never change. I have tried changing my behavior, I went outside and talked to people, but deep within I still have genes from that man. That's what bugs me. Last night, a revelation hit me, that I WILL become HIM at one point. That's what scares me, that's what sends chills down my spine.
Because I WANT to live, I don't want to die. I genuinely think that life is beautiful if you're with the right people. But if destiny wants it, I will die. I have been suicidal before, a big part of the reason being my dad's shenanigans.
Still though, even after all of that, I still think I am not ready to die. I don't know why, call me a coward, but I don't think I am ready to do it just yet. I don't know how I will keep living on KNOWING that I will one day become just like my father.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

As men, it is crucial, of paramount importance, that we have a healthy male figure while growing up to guide us into manhood. Unfortunately you didn't have one. I'm sorry for you. I didn't have one either.

My father was never there. He was (and is) alive and lived only a few kilometers away but he never bothered. His absence, coupled with the overbearing controlling nature of my mother, resulted in my psychological ""castration"" from a very early age and I never learned how to be a man. A coward enslaved by fear, that's me.

Much of what's gone wrong in my life are results of things that were out of my control and that happened before I was wise enough to anything about them. This enrages me so much that I feel like destroying the entire universe and everything in it so nothing can exist ever again.

I too promised myself I'd never be like him.

Do you even want to be memorialized/remembered after you CTB?,2652300,Ariii,"Aug 31, 2024 at 12:41 AM","I don't, ideally every evidence of my existence would be erased but that's obviously not realistic. Even when I was a child, I never even wanted to be perceived; I see any potential attempt as remembering/honoring me as an extension of being perceived. Simply put, I don't want people to know I exist or have existed.

Adding onto that, whenever, especially online, I see people commemorating people who have CTB, it just feels selfish to me. I get that people do it to cope with death, but I doubt that there are many people who wanted their suicide and other issues to be blasted online for strangers to see. And so often, it's to advocate for the total prevention of suicide in any cases and for the horrid mental health system that very often doesn't work. It feels like people who have never been suicidal trying to push their ideals by using the death of someone who very likely didn't agree with said ideals. Of course, I'm assuming quite a lot, but I do feel like I'm at least partly justified to think this",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vacuum compression (space saver) bag a feasible option?,2652298,Soupster,"Aug 31, 2024 at 12:23 AM","So, you'd have to figure out an airtight seal, which could be tricky. Assuming you figure that out, it's just suffocating with extra steps. Asphyxiation is a painful, scary process and not at all calm or peaceful. It's one of the reasons hanging methods emphasize making sure to block the blood to the brain not just strangle the airway.

If you really want to go this route, and I can't recommend it, you owe it to yourself to read a bit about the asphyxiation process.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,2646047,Themogger,"Aug 26, 2024 at 7:23 AM","This was just a crazy idea I thought of whilst planning my ctb to the finest detail. A classic bait and switch.
My method is SN but I wondered if there was a way to throw off my fam or whoever finds my body(temporarily ofcourse, SN can be detected in autopsy) by using a decoy.
Let's say the decoy is recently emptied liquid soap cans/bottles(to make it seem like you drank em, catch my drift?). You could place em at just the right place so that incase you get find out like 10min after passing out or too early, ""they"" make assumptions. Assumptions which could buy you time.

For this to work, you'd have to take advantage of windows of time. In a typical regiment, you get about 40min after taking painkillers to prepare the SN mixtures (backup included). But 40min is a long time and you could get rid of the SN package. The second window is after ingesting the first mixture, before you start seeing symptoms you could get rid of the cups you made em in. Washing or just throwing away if disposable. You could throw the second mixture into one of the emptied liquid bottle but you would have to have emptied it since and rinse that specific one thoroughly so it doesn't contaminate the mixture. That way, when the symptoms set in, you're surrounded by only decoys, the liquid soap bottles, and I guess a vomiting bag. You're most likely to vomit which means you can take the second mixture (from the liquid soap bottle) which removes every trace of SN and hence, concludes this elaborate prank.

This obviously isn't necessary. And it could be considered cruel like in the sense of telling a friend that you lost their phone, only to later reveal that it's actually intact and just scratched. Easing in bad news with even worse news. But it is unnecessary, conditions are different for everyone, so jjst ignore this. No wait, if you have a better idea than liquid soap bottles, drop a suggestion...then ignore.

Simplicity is the ultimate complexity",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2646060,rozeske,"Aug 26, 2024 at 7:41 AM","SN poisoning death has a very distinct look. Like recognizable with just a first look even before autopsy results. Hard to manipulate cause of death. I'm also against pranking people to their possible death. SN is a highly toxic substance. Everything around you could be a potential denger, possibly including your vomit. Plus you won't likely have the energy to properly get rid of ""evidence"" once you have reached the vomiting stage, except to maybe barely drink the 2nd cup which you might leave full or barely touched. I'd rather put a visible sign of caution of toxicity and proper disposal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was planning on holding out to give my family one or two more good memories with me, but I can't do it anymore! They want me to live for them for the rest of my life but I can't hold out a few more months longer! At this stage, months sound like years and days like months. Every hour is torment. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it, I hate it that I haven't ordered the meds sooner so I could just get it over with tomorrow. What a waste my life was. Every waking second just more bullshit I spoon fed myself. I am such an dense moron for the constant lying to myself. None of that makes it better, it just makes me seem more of an idiot, which I guess I am! I can't live in this body any longer. People talk about feeling peace before it happens but all I feel is angry and upset at all this wasted, all the time, money, emotional labor, worrying, all for what? For me to die? Yes, it seems so! I hate how everything thats happened has led up to...nothing. These poor people, my family, get emotionally attached to someone who isn't even going to be here in the next 6 months. That's tragic. But everyday is 'tragic' for me. Having to exist and live like this to please other people. I can't do it, I won't do it, I have the sn, I'm ordering the pills, I'll go to some hotel, I won't leave a note. I don't care about getting a job anymore, I really don't. If I make it till November, well, then that means I've found some sort of work that doesn't make me want to off myself instantly but really, really, I don't see that happening at all. I'm sorry for ruining my siblings life and leaving my parents and grandparents with my $5,000 of debt. I don't know how they're going to handle that.

Before I left, he gave me weed and olanzapine (5mg). I took one when I got home, at approximately 2pm. After that, I took a shower and cleaned my room, and then I began to feel exhausted. I went to bed, and I woke up at 4pm, dazed and drenched in sweat. I went back to sleep until 6pm and then got up to cook dinner. I felt so disoriented and weak. For the next few hours, I kept falling back asleep, and then I finally went to bed at 9pm and didn't wake up until the next morning (Thursday). For the entire day yesterday, it felt like I had been hit by a bus. I felt so weak and so tired, and every time I stood up, it felt like I was going to fall over. Last night, I went to sleep at about 8pm and just woke up at around 7am (it's Friday morning here). I finally feel like myself again. Is this normal?

"Will ctb in September, wanted to thank y'all",2639589,SocialSoil,"Aug 20, 2024 at 12:32 PM","I've been browsing this site for around a year now, and now I got opportunity to thank you all properly.

I have tough situation in my family and probably seen some crap earlier than I should. I never lived like normal child should, feels like I've been made by two people who shouldn't even try to have a child. I live with the person who had pushed my mother to ctb attempt and never felt sorry about it. I can't name anyone who is blood-connected to me as a normal family. Among them is no people that care about me. I feel like everyone there is scarred, have blurry vision, but instead of reality they see their own reflexion and talk to it, ignoring actual human being. Everyone there needs therapy and I am the only one who actually went for it.

Onset of depression was at 11 years old, at 15 I was properly diagnosed with depression, and year ago diagnosis changed to F33.1. I was ready to ctb 3 times. My therapists tried lot of pills, current one suspects I have resistency for antidepressants. I did my best and maked it as I was able to.

Month ago, one event happened, and I feel like I'm done. If I was worried that I won't live good, now I am 100% sure of it. I am tired and it's just better to ctb while everyone know me as a good person before they and I see my downfall. Decision to ctb seems a bit easier to living a life I cannot handle as good as I wish. But, I mean, what's the point of living if it will be POV of turning into a mess? And... change of period, from fall to summer and from winter to spring, for me is a time when depression gets way worse. Last time, at spring, my therapist changed dosage of my pills to 2x. And if I feel like shit now, what will it be at fall? I just won't survive. These dosages are almost maximum allowed per day. I'm tired. I'm tired of trying to survive another time.

I planned to ctb after I turn 18 and will write a will. I turned 18 recently. I'm going to sell all jewelry I have and distribute most of my clothes. I will make a lifetime contract with a funeral agency and pay them beforehand so my family won't have to waste money on cremation. Then I will write a will. And before October I will ctb. I wanna do cleaning after me as easy as it can be: laying towels under myself, using diuretic and laxative, opening window so smell won't keep in room, if I'm lucky enough I'll get small fan and use it too. I will call my best friend, chat with him a bit, and then at 0.00 AM will turn some lo-fi stream so my last minutes will be chill, and ctb by night-night.

And how you helped me? Now I am not worried about ctb method. I saw that it doesn't have to be always agony. It's easier when you know your last moments will be peaceful. I've seen your community and how you actually respect and understand others' choices, how you listen to the people. And now I can thank you for this. Browsing this site might be one of the best things in this year. I'm glad I've found you. Really, thank you all. I'm so, so happy that I've seen some light because of you. Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know it would take some time to ctb, so that's why I plan to do it on night. Even if my friend calls ambulance, it'll take around 30 minutes, so I hope I'll be dead by that time.
I thought about SN, too, and I can even legally buy it, I am just really scared of all the pain. It's not even expensive, around $7 for 0,5 kg, but I am only scared of how painful it will be. I don't have places for hanging, and overdose of pills doesn't sound reliable, too. So now for me it's either SN or night night.

"Will ctb in September, wanted to thank y'all",2643841,SocialSoil,"Aug 24, 2024 at 7:52 AM","Small update. Maybe just for myself.
First, I'm definitely using SN. I checked prices, where I live it turns out to cost around $7 for kg. I bought diuretic and antienemetic, and already have laxative. Now I just need to go to psychiatrist and get capacity certificate, then quickly go to notary and make a will, then to the bank... I'm not sure where to get powers to go to psychiatrist. It should be easy, but uh. I also live with person who doesn't know anything about my plans, gladly, and I need to keep it that way somehow.
Second, I had massive breakdown recently, just cried on bed for solid hour. At the moment I wrote to my friend groupchat and told them about my plans, just that I'll ctb and got prepared - nothing about method. And... they support me. They know I have mental struggles and witnessed when I tried to overdose by atarax (surprisingly, I just felt a bit dizzy, slept good for 3 hours and that's all lmao). So they understand that it's useless to straight stop me, I guess, since they know what I am going through... But seeing their reaction was so comforting. Like, really, they said lot of kind words. Supported me. I'll miss them, but it's better than what waits for me if I live. I'm glad I have met them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

So it's been almost 2 weeks since my birthday, and from my aunt's family only auntie congratulated me. I have a cousin, and for last his birthday I asked what he would want as a gift, and made a custom plushie for him. He hadn't congratulated me. I would be okay with it if he hadn't wrote to me today.
He suddenly asked if I am at the town and started calling me. I asked what's wrong, and only thing, only fucking thing he said: ""Can you buy me some beer?"" (he is underage). Nothing else. Not even any apologies that he forgot about my birthday, or congratulation with past birthday. Just the question. I reminded him that, for his birthday, I made a plushie he wanted, and now he forgot about my birthday and only asks for beer. He said ""I'm sorry"", I answered that I won't buy him beer anyways, and he said ""Unluck. Bye then"" and that's it.
I feel so... dissappointed, bitter, angry a bit. Never in my life I have been bad to him. Why would he treat me that way? I just... ugh. I sent screenshots with our chat to my aunt and blocked him for now. If I can't influence on his behavior, I'm sure his mom can. Maybe I'll update when situation changes. Eh.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

You need to start disciplining him, and no, that does not mean using positive punishment on him (positive punishments often are or lead to abuse. Negative punishment and positive reinforcement tend to be the most effective means of disciplining children). You should aim for a more authoritative parenting style (not authoritarian).

You should also look into talking to him to see what might be going on since children sometimes act out as a result of stress, trauma, and/or mental illness. It would also probably be helpful to get him counselling or something to get him to learn to better regulate his emotions and to have someone to vent to.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently it'd be the most effortless way of going about this, as all I'd need is to wait till winter (which is when I'm planning to off myself anyway), go outside semi-clothed, go to the nearby forest, maybe take off my clothes, lay down and simply wait until the deed is done. Since I ideally would like to not experience the pain of being submerged in a pile of snow, I thought of blacking out beforehand by mixing alcohol (vodka, rum etc.) with a carbonated drink, since I remember being told that this is how you get alcohol faster into your bloodstream.
I wanted to know if this method is reliable enough, and whether there's something I should take into consideration before actually attempting it. My only concerns so far are: which weather temperature I should aim for, and whether the alcohol might ruin the process of hypothermia, since it will warm me up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

What if I’m making this decision too young,2652397,Voidbather,"Aug 31, 2024 at 4:06 AM","As my life goes on and I keep steadily losing hope I've now (nearly) come to the conclusion that I want to CTB. Every day is like climbing Mount Everest. I have no direction, I don't care anymore and I'm done trying. My mental state is declining and I don't see it getting better.

However..

The one thing that still makes me hesitate is a lot of my life is still ahead, I'm still young. (And yes, I'm old enough to be on this site just still pretty young) People have found goodness in their life after inconceivable lows, and even though this seems pretty much impossible to me at this point, there's still this one thing keeping me from following through. I can't decide if I should let it go now and end my pain or just keep going and see what happens. I'm scared of continuing because I don't know if things will get worse and the way I feel now will be even more crushing. But you never know, I could miraculously sort out my degrading mental state and put something together. Being on the fence is hard, I wish I could just decide already.

I know this might seem childish or a strange thing to get hung up on but it's been eating away at me. I can't talk about it with my loved ones because they already don't leave me alone because they know I'm about to leave them. So this is really the only place I could turn.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Getting SN in Spain,2641012,retVarii,"Aug 21, 2024 at 5:14 PM","Hello, SaSu. There's lot of things on my mind right now and I don't really know where to start. I panic every time I have to communicate someone, even if I just have to write an email or a post. I'm also just really bad at communicating my feelings and thoughts. Sorry.

In any case, for the last five months I have been preparing for the SN method. I already have antiemetics and antacids, but I have trouble getting SN itself. I am trying to find a source that ships to Spain, but preferably based in Spain. The problem is, most of the companies I have contacted ask for my company name, so I gather they don't sell products to private individuals.

Now, I have a corporate email from my university, but I don't know if that will slide, since my university is not only outside of Spain, but outside of the EU in general. So I doubt I can give them my tax data. Also, they sell it in 25kg bags which is way more than I need.

"Would you have done it sooner? Also, my situation",2652307,neurotic,"Aug 31, 2024 at 12:54 AM","Knowing your future and experiences now, would you have done it sooner?

My situation if interested:

Before I begin, I want to say I do not think I am the smartest person, more so I'm a very hyperaware and conscious person. I'm currently 23, but as I age I still feel like my hyper-awareness is growing. You can pick out hyper-aware people just from their eyes. That blank, cold, glazed stare. Someone who understands and have seen what life is. It's a terrifying existence, being awake to the dream and the implications of it all. This is extremely worrying as at age 19 I remember hoping I would ""dumb down"" or stop caring as much, but it's been the opposite. Making connections with friends or partners is harder and feels pointless when you already know the game that's being played. Talking to therapists, there's just something missing, a facet of the human condition they're refusing to face and spewing regurgitated encouragement that I feel they themselves probably struggle with or refuse to comprehend out of fear for their mortality. No one has any answers, fear of death is just hardwired in us to keep us breeding, humans are the scariest creatures the earth has ever produced. Days are slipping by faster and faster and trauma heals slower with age. Life shouldn't exist, it needs to die. This world isn't meant for such a mass production of humans, the genetic pool has gotten too chaotic with inferior genes, leading to things like me. The real ending to any of this is the hope that we eventually kill ourselves with global warming, war, or famine. I can't enjoy time with my family or friends anymore, I put on a good act, but they can tell I'm obviously depressed. I could never tell them the truth. I could never, ever tell them how I see the world, they'd start to see reality. It's slipped some times, and their reaction always kills me. I put a bandaid on it as fast as I can, try to tell them that what I said wasn't true and that it's worth it. Lying to my little brothers and sister, I want to cry. They look at me with such innocence and excitement about everything. If I'm not happy, they're not happy. They all adore me and are absolutely infatuated with me because I know how to empathize with them, what they need, and how to take care of them. I have so, so many family members and friends tell me I'm the most important person in their lives, I'm the smartest person they know, that I've got it all figured out, that I always have the answers. There's multiple people who have centered their whole perspective on life around me, mimicking me in such outlandish ways like copying my field in college or applying for jobs I work at, constantly trying to be my friend or date me, trying to Be Me, It's so creepy and it's not a one off thing. Maybe they're fasinated by me, at how I'm so close yet so distant, never letting them know the real me. They want to be closer and closer, they want to figure me out and obsess, I can tell. I would never give them the hell of letting myself rub off on them though, so I'll always keep my distance. They'll copy my views and feelings on life with how much they all look up to me. I feel like everyone in my life relies on me for happiness. My own parents and older brothers treat me like I'm some sort of guidance or support system for them. I've never had that from anyone. I've had so many friends, relationships, and partners, but the connection is always missing. I never feel like they really understand this thing called life as much as I do. I thought maybe I was thinking too much about it, or maybe it was because I was autistic, or maybe because it's BPD. The horrifying truth of my existence is I just understand things a lot better than most people, probably more than what a human naturally should. I want to kill myself so bad, ever since I was younger, but I think about how if I were gone, the absolute hell I'd be leaving for the ones who love me. I told them that I was thinking about packing all my stuff and just going, but they're all so selfish. They were horrified at the idea of me missing. My entire family organized together to try and convince me to stay, texting me, calling me, expressing their sadness to me if I left. I feel like I've been nothing but a caretaker for my entire life for everyone. I've never been in the passenger seat, I've never experienced what I give and I yearn for it so much, the feeling of relief I'd have if someone could take care of me and make me feel like everything was going to be okay. The fantasies I dream of, someone coming into my life who understands what I feel and could help me find some sort of positive meaning to it all. But there never is and I see right through it when they try to get close to me. I'm so desperate I'll ignore all the warning signs and red flags and just pretend I'm naive and not know any better, hoping to feel something.

I should've done it before when not as many people cared. For now, I have the blessing of youth as an umbilical cord, but when that soon ends, I will have to watch myself decay with the ones I love. I'll watch in horror for the rest of my life, also knowing they'll all be looking at me asking me if it was all worth it, and I'll have to lie to their faces. However, I refuse to believe my purpose is to rot here with them, I genuinely want to leave everything behind, I'm planning on it, whether it be suicide or physically moving somewhere far away. There has to be something out there. I still have a little time. I care about them, but I need to have my own life, I need to search for someone or a group of people who understands. SS has been one of the most amazing sites I've ever found, with so many well educated people. I'm truly blessed to have found a calmness in the storm.

I'd like to ask your kind assistance if you can help me in any non prescription drugs to go with the SN method? So that I'll be able to absorb the SN without vomiting and with minimal pain. I want my suicide to be as peaceful as possible. I have access to a supplier of SN in the Philippines, but I don't know if any of the drugs recommended by this forum are available to me without prescription. I am so done with myself. I couldn't bear the agony anymore. I am so hurt and depressed right now. The world has been very unkind to me. My parents are planning for a vacation abroad in two months and I figured this is the perfect time to do it, and it's really frustrating that I'll have to wait 2 more agonizing and painful months before I can do this. I want it to be as quick as possible.

I am 32 years old right now, and my weight is about 140-150 lbs I think. If there is a God, I pray and beg for His forgiveness and understanding that I couldn't go on anymore. I don't want to suffer for the rest of my life. I really wish reincarnation is real. If it is indeed real, I wish God will be kind to me in my next life, or at least I'm normal and won't suffer from various mental illnesses, or if I indeed will suffer from a mental illness again, I wish my parents would be more understanding and that our family would be better off financially so we can afford my necessary meds.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was able to buy SN from a supplier, and twice nahuli ako ng nanay ko at tinapon. Ang worry ko lang is kung may mabalitaan na namatay due to SN, at nalaman sila ang supplier, baka maghigpit na sila at hindi na ako makabili, baka maghigpit din ang BFAD. Kaya ang ginagawa ko, tinatanggal ko yung sticker ng packaging para hindi matrace sa kanila. Kaya I really need to do this fast dahil wala na ako alam na ibang method. Mahirap talaga magpakamatay dito sa Pinas na relatively peaceful, kailangan violent and painful methods. Also, sabi daw nila pure SN daw, pero I have my doubts kung puro dahil mura lang, while I looked online mas mahal ang ibang suppliers. But it is pure white. Kasi kung curing salt lang yon, dapat pink ang color.

i tried inhaling butane, spray deodorant and others but not effective.

Pinaka basic need lang is SN, Water, Domperidome, Paracetamol/Ibuprofen, Antacid (Gaviscon Liquid prefer ko) which is all OTC.

Eto yung supplier na dinodoubt ko if purong SN or not. Also, hindi mo na dapat binanggit yung pangalan ng brand, dahil baka balikan at madamay sila. Ayoko din mandamay ng iba. Tinanggal ko na yung sticker. Balak ko sana yung stat dose para mabilisan saka oras ang hinahabol ko e, pag nagkataon wala ang parents ko, kasi pag 48 hours masyadong matagal at baka makita agad ako. Is stat dose recommended din ba? I read its as effective as 48 hour regimen, at eto pa nga nirerecommend ng the peaceful pill handbook. I remember back in college 10 years ago, suicidal din ako, nabasa ko pdf file nito. I never imagined back then na gagawin ko na siya ngayon at mapupunta ako sa kalagayang to. Nakabili na ko ng meds na required. Kating kati na ako, hindi ko na din talaga kaya, sobra na agony at misery ko, gusto ko na talaga matapos to. Hindi na ako makakaintay ng ilang buwan o ilang linggo. Sobrang sakit na. Aalis ang parents ko mga next week pa sa sept. 7, sana ganado pa ako that time at sana matuloy na. Kailangan stat dose para mabilisan. Dawalang linggo pa ako magtitiis at problema ko baka mawalan uli ako ng gana. :( . I attempted noong Aug 16 by checking in into a hotel sana, pero hindi natuloy dahil naabutan ako ng pagsara ng shop. If I will not be able to do this by sept. 7, the next time would be in late october na pag nagabroad parents ko. Hinding hindi ko na kaya tiisin ng ilang buwan pa.

Sana mapatawad at maintindihan ako ng Diyos, sana maawa Siya saken. I did everything I could na, wala talaga. I have begged for His forgiveness multiple times and sobra kong pinagsisisihan lahat lahat ng mga kasalanan ko, I mean all of them, including yung mga hindi ko pa maamin, mula kabataan ko hanggang ngayon. Sana maintindihan ako ng Diyos na hindi ko na talaga kaya na habangbuhay ako magdudusa in misery and agony. Also, I dont want my parents sana to feel guilty. Naiintindihan ko naman din sila, dahil hindi kame mayaman, at may mga sakit din sila, kaya hindi ako mapagamot. Ayoko magsisi at maguilty sila, hindi sila nagkulang saken. Eto na lang din sana naisip ko na tulong sa kanila para mabawasan na mga problema nila, dahil naging pabigat ako sa kanila, ever since natanggal ako sa trabaho noong 2016. Sana mapatawad, maintindihan at kaawaan ako ng Diyos.

How I also wish na sana reincarnation is real. :( I wish God will be kind to me in my next life, kahit man lang sana at least wala akong mental illnesses. :(

Ang pinakainaalala ko talaga ay yung mother ko, and also my father na makaDiyos pa naman. Kung ano mararamdaman nila pag namatay na ako. I will be hurt din, and I am so much worried about them, kung ano mangyayare sa kanila, kung ano mararamdaman nila, at kung ibeblame ba nila mga sarili nila, magsisisi sila, magiguilty sila, etc. Lalo na panganay ako, first born ako, kaya sobrang sakit sa kanila to panigurado. Ayoko isipin nila na nagkulang sila saken, at ayoko din isipin ng ibang tao to. Mahal ko pa din sila, sila rin lang talaga nagmamatter saken, pero hindi ko na talaga kaya. Hindi din madaling desisyon saken to, kaya sinasabi nila makasarili daw ang mga nagpapakamatay. Pero wala na ako choice, at hindi ko na talaga kaya tiisin to.",2644415,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hypocrites and liars !!!,2642706,tiaralamb,"Aug 23, 2024 at 6:44 AM","I truly do not believe any of those journalists care, not a single one. They just want brownie points for their 'investigative exposè' and the shock value driven ""spooky website is killing young people !1!!1!!"" clicks from worried parents and teachers who probably also believe TikTok is grooming their children into the CCP.

SS has been an open 'internet secret' for years now. Get over it. It's a resource like any other, and no, people do not actively encourage or worsen the symptoms of others. Recovery is always on the table. Ffs look at any 'I'm about to ctb' thread. Reply after reply of 'Are you sure? Are you sure? Ok, but please be certain you're sure.'

Face it. Everyone who is gone now left because of their shitty circumstances and lack of support, and the 'communities' they had irl probably failed them and forced them into that position in the first place.

We live in a world where aside from a lucky few it is mandatory that you:

Are able to handle daily social interaction, including navigating complex social norms and implicit signals
Consistently overcome repeated loads of stress
Have impeccable timekeeping and time management
Be constantly aware of what's real and what isn't
Have no off-putting or 'weird' characteristics whatsoever
Be dependable and friendly, even when going through incredibly painful circumstances
Continuously contribute to the upkeep of your personal health, hygiene and living space
Are not in anyway susceptible to states of being such as hyper-fixation which can 'distract from your priorities'
Have a specific learning style suited for most education systems
Have no issues with impulse control or decision making

This is only a small snippet. There is so much that the world demands of mentally ill and neurodivergent people that we are simply not capable of due to the condition we are in. Treatment is so productivity driven, more focused on turning an afflicted person into a good worker/societal contributor than someone actually contented.

Anybody who blames RESOURCES for suicide is a hypocrite and a liar. I simply do not care to dance around it anymore. The big issue staring you right in your face is that as it stands, many people forced to live in this world are incompatible with it. That's just the truth. And until that changes you can continue to act shocked when people choose to say 'fuck it' and stop trying to fit a round peg in a square hole, but trying to find an easy excuse like you're pinning the tail on the donkey is not going to work this time.

I hate my job and I can't find a different one. I see the box cutters at work and I just want to slit my throat open in front of everyone. My life is just consumed by dread about going to work. I don't know what to do, I already tried looking for other jobs but they are all the same and the ones I would like to do aren't hiring. I don't know if I can hold out and keep waiting for something better. I don't want to die, there is so much I want to learn, things I want to read and watch, but I can't keep living if I have to work at this shitty job. Last night I spent the entire shift trying not to break down, and I was planning how I would go to the wharf and drown myself as soon as my shift finished, but it was a late night and the only thought that stopped me was that I didn't want to ruin my mum's sleep if she realised I never came home that night and worried. I wish I did it though, now I have to go to work again today and poison my mind even more with suicidal thoughts which is all I can think about while I am at work.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

dmc packaging and welfare check,2625288,Nephy,"Aug 9, 2024 at 5:10 AM","On my package was a bill with concrete information about what's in it

Here is something I found to tell if someone ask you:

Coloring Wood with Sodium Nitrite:

Sodium Nitrite as a Wood Stain: Sodium nitrite can be used to color wood. It reacts with the natural tannins in the wood, leading to a chemical reaction that darkens the wood. This method is particularly effective with oak wood, which has a high tannin content.

Application Steps:

1. Preparing the Wood: The wood should be clean, dry, and free from grease or other contaminants.
2. Preparing the Sodium Nitrite Solution: A solution of sodium nitrite in water is prepared, usually with a concentration of about 5-10%.
3. Applying the Solution: The sodium nitrite solution is evenly applied to the wood surface, for example, using a brush or cloth.
4. Allowing to React: The solution needs time to react with the wood. Depending on the type of wood and the desired intensity of the color, this can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour.
5. Neutralizing and Drying: After the reaction time, the wood should be neutralized with a weak acid solution (e.g., acetic acid) to remove any excess sodium nitrite and stop the reaction. The wood is then thoroughly dried.

Result:

The result is a dark brown to black coloration of the wood, produced by the chemical reaction between sodium nitrite and the tannins in the wood. This color is unique to this method and cannot be exactly replicated with other stains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Possible Misdiagnosis,2652296,depthss,"Aug 31, 2024 at 12:20 AM","I was in the hospital after I failed my attempt, I met with a new psychologist in there
I was diagnosed with Autism when I was about 13, so it's been a few years. He told me during one the second appointment with him that he wasn't seeing autism, and I was instead told some other things by both him and psychiatrists ( borderline/schizotypal )
being misdiagnosed with a mental disability is such an odd experience. I feel relief that I don't have it, it was honestly something I was insecure about for awhile. But it's very hard adjusting to the fact that my entire perception and everything I think/feel is different to what I've been told it is for years
Have any other people here been misdiagnosed with a mental disorder? What's it like for you, and how weird do you find it adjusting upon figuring out it was a misdiagnosis",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Possible Misdiagnosis,2652299,Soupster,"Aug 31, 2024 at 12:29 AM","As to the autism diagnosis- I'd seek a neutral third opinion. Someone not affiliated with the doc's who diagnosed you with autism or the doc's who said you didn't have it. It's not uncommon for doc's to disagree but assuming one is right and the other is wrong is a hard thing to do without more information.

As for me, I had perhaps one of the more common misdiagnosis there are. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder which turned out to be bipolar 1 instead. To be fair until you've had a full blown manic episode the two look very much alike. Throw in cPTSD and a litany of anxiety disorders and it makes for a hot mess anyways.

The diagnostic process is extremely heterogenic and there is no meaningful way of measuring them; the providers that does the diagnosing is likely to let their own bias influence the process which means you could get five different diagnosis if you saw five different providers and the criteria are so broadened that most people would fit into several at one point or another, even more so because there is A LOT of overlap between them.

Possible Misdiagnosis,2652402,ForgottenAgain,"Aug 31, 2024 at 4:13 AM","Yes. I was diagnosed with Borderline PD and severe depression when I was around 16. More than 10 years passed and I was very unwell, went to the crisis team and told them my diagnosis since they asked. They heard Borderline PD and never made an effort to help me, even telling me I need to be realistic with my expectations (I told them I wanted to be happy).

Then off to the Community Mental Health psychiatrist, she read Borderline PD and same thing. Meanwhile, I was seeing a private psychologist and he told me he didn't see the Borderline PD, that to him looks like I have cPTSD.

I even discussed this with the psychiatrist, telling her I don't have black and white thinking, I'm quite balanced, I don't have unstable relationships, etc. I used to be like that, when I was a teen, but not anymore, I changed a lot as a person.

She didn't buy it and basically rationalised that me thinking that taking med A should give effect B is black and white thinking (this because I told her I wanted to know what I was supposed to feel when taking antidepressants since I felt they didn't work with me, and that drugs go through trials so they can measure the effects so surely she could tell me what I was supposed to feel but she always went back to ""every person feels the meds differently"") and that me liking spreadsheets and organization also proves that.

I tried to get an independent opinion through a private psychiatrist but he wouldn't see me unless I shared with him the NHS records, which have the Borderline PD diagnosis, so I figured he would be like the other psychiatrists, read that and not do any thinking of his own.

So now I don't know for certain what I have but I really think is cPTSD as it fits a lot better with my symptoms. I'm grateful for my current psychologist for having told me about that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
My Mind and My Plan Are Set,2645272,H4t,"Aug 25, 2024 at 1:59 PM","I've posted previously, venting about my first attempt.

At the time of the first attempt I was distraught and, frankly, out of my mind with grief. It made me sloppy.
I've regained a lot of clarity and perspective since then. It was cemented what I want: to die. To cease to exist. I apologise if that's too blunt for some.
Ironically, during a time of anxiety, stress, grief, sadness, and so many other emotions, the first and only time I gain peace and clarity of mind was when I decided when and how I would try again.

This time I have the luxury of this site and the resources, time, clarity, and most of all: privacy.

My method: partial suspension hanging.
I was initially going to go full suspension route, then I found this method. I am aware of claimed failure rates, but I have a contingency for that.

I won't share the details here, because even though I know it's highly unlikely anyone I know would find this, I can't take chances.

But I have the list of what I need, and preparations start on payday this coming week.
I'll be sourcing a rope no thicker than 12mm.
I will be using a mouthguard.
I have a scarf to pad my neck.
I had tested the strength of the anchor point, and have tested a slipknot on my neck. My confidence isn't as high without the final rope I'll be using, but this is why the luxury of time is so crucial.

I even have a way to prevent anyone from accidentally discovering me, thanks to a locking door, a key duplicate, and a warning note with the appropriate people to call.
My previous plan was too public, and even though I know I won't care later, I want to make sure no one is unnecessarily scarred by the discovery of my body.

This time I have made sure to avoid mess. And if I fail, I will be completely alone, hopefully with minimal damage to myself and surroundings. I can pick myself up, try again, or go for another time with no one the wiser. No pesky mental institutions and interventions.

I wouldn't say I'm proud or too confident in my plan. I'm all too aware of the failure rates and the risks involved. I do feel good about it and at peace. I feel that I've done everything I can to make sure to minimise certain impacts, and this time avoid property damage.

I know this is probably confirmation bias, or could be argued to be such. However, I don't care. I believe my reasons are rational and emotional and valid, and that's not something that is easy to convince anyone about, so I won't be asking permission.

I regret that this will affect my ex in the ways that it will. A small part of me, the vengeful spiteful part, is satisfied that she can get a glimpse into how she ruined my life. I know she'll be fine. She's got a lot of resources and is innocent of anything linked with my attempt.

I really think you should try to let this go at some point when you've had some time to think things over. I don't think you really did anything so horrible, and I don't think your friend thinks that either. A lot of people just have a boundary with suicide, justified or not, and if you cross that boundary they'll feel like they have to let you go.

My partner just left me 4 months before getting engaged.,2652258,Cyber4ngel!,"Aug 30, 2024 at 11:18 PM","I can't believe my boyfriend left me just four months before we were supposed to get engaged.

I haven't been active even on SaSu because life has gotten too difficult.

I can't believe I was about to become a wife and move in with the love of my life, only for him to abandon me. I've struggled with depression my whole life; from my earliest memories, I have always been depressed. The first thing I do when meeting someone is to warn them that I have mental health issues and that I might experience depressive episodes that last for months.

When I met him, I was doing well and had been stable for a long time. I was productive, going out, and active. But I swear, I was so open about everything and told him, like I do with everyone, that I am depressed and that this might happen at some point.

Now I'm facing many problems in my life. In less than three months, I've gone from living my whole life as described in my introduction post (u can prolly find it on my profile if u want to read it), where I was literally in bed all day, unable to do anything or study because of my abusive family, to moving out and managing everything on my own: learning to cook from scratch, cleaning, handling paperwork, doing monthly shopping, and caring for my three cats.

Maybe it doesn't seem like a lot for other people, but for me it's overwhelming because it's so much at once.
On top of that, I have a difficult relationship with my brother, who leaves all the responsibilities to me and constantly demands more. My father keeps trying to enter my life to torment me. I found out that a friend I've had for six years, whom I trusted a lot, was just trying to sleep with me. I also learned that my best friend since childhood is leaving the country, and last month I fell seriously ill and almost died. I had to go to the emergency room and was hospitalized, and now I can't find a job due to my physical and mental health. I don't have the money to keep paying rent, and I might be evicted soon if I dont get a job, I tried making art commissions but its not going well, and from where I'm from no one is paying more than five dollars for a drawing, if Im evicted, which at this rate im sure it will happen, it means going back to my father's house, where I was abused, and losing my cats, who are the only things that really matter to me in this world. I'd be back to not being fed, not being allowed to bathe or even wash my clothes, and being sexually harassed all the time.

All of this has led me into a depressive episode.

The problem is that, as a partner, i am completely open about everything. Even in the middle of an emotional crisis, the first thing I think about is not hurting my partner. And trying not to burden people, I explain why I'm feeling bad, reassure him that it's not his fault, and tell him how he can help me and what triggers me and how I can feel better. I explain everything. If I have a problem with my partner, I discuss it honestly and communicate openly. I'm attentive, always checking if he might need something like holding his drink if his hands are cold. I make gifts whenever I can, even if I don't have money rn i make handmade crafts, i get him flowers or food. I plan outings, find new places to go, propose new activities, suggest playing video games over calls, and explain every move I make to avoid causing an insecurity to my partner.
When he has a bad moment, I listen and am a shoulder to cry on, a distraction, and I give advice if asked.

I consider this the bare minimum and it's what I give and expect in a relationship.

When I was doing well, my partner was with me all the time. We went out and talked all day. We were together for a year. But now, when I'm in one of the worst times of my life and need him the most, he left me alone. He didn't even come to see me when I asked. Instead, he spent the whole weekend with his friends. When I told him I wanted to CTB, and that I desperately needed help bc I just wanted things to get better instead of CTB , he told me to do whatever I wanted and that he couldn't help me.
All I asked was for him to come to my house one day, without me having to ask, to hug me for at least 15 minutes and talk, or at least bring me a flower from the street, even that would've fixed everything, literally a hug at the right moment would've fixed everything... But he didn't show up and left me crying alone, even though we were so close to getting engaged and living together.
He was never like this with me until he saw me truly depressed and now I'm no longer appealing to him. He used to be so kind before he was so angry at me..

The moral of the story is that everyone loves you when you're at your best and can give them the world, but as soon as you need a hand and can't be as productive as before, they will abandon you. This isn't the first time it's happened to me, and I don't understand why. It makes me sad because I feel like I have no place in this world due to my illness and that I don't deserve anyone to make an extra effort for me, even though I do it for others. No one comes to save me, and all I needed was a hug and reassurance.

I sincerely wish him all the best in the world, and I hope he finds someone for whom he is willing to do that extra effort, I still love him so much but I know I didn't deserve this, but If I could go back time and pretend to be okay just for him to stay I would, I love him so much and I wish I could be his partner for all of our lives. At least I know this will make it less painful for him if I CTB, i wish I was deserving of love and the princess treatment I wanted but I'm not.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

That said, from what you described he probably meant well. Lots of people think they can handle our mental health and the issues surrounding it, but when it comes right down to the dark reality, can't. They just can't understand, or if they do can't handle the constant drain of our bad times. It doesn't make them bad people, they just can't handle it.

The worst thing is that we dont live far, only 20 mins away on bus, when he had to go back from my place to his at night I kept him company and I would go back to my house alone after that, I just really wanted it to work bc I love him so much.

I know he's not a bad person, he was really trying to make me happy but he just couldn't understand what I was going through, he thought it was not that serious and that I could fix those things alone and do it quick but I can't even get out of bed to go to the bathroom these days, he was mad at me for not trying hard enough. But I know he is a good man and he is truly kind at heart, that's why I really do wish him a good life

The life you imagined with him was never going to happen, because he's a coward and he ditched you at the slightest hint of there possibly needing to be just a little bit of effort involved from his side to make the relationship work; hell, even just to get you back up on your feet.

Seriously, don't take it out on yourself or question your value as a human being. Life gets hard for everyone, but unfortunately, the world is full of immature people who would rather run from problems than to be reliable companions. You're not unlovable.

I promise you there are people out there who care and who have love for people in this world, they're just hard to find. You've gotta keep looking if you can bear to do it.

I wish you the best and I hope you can find a way out of this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not judging you, I know that abuse gets weird like that sometimes. I don't understand why you couldn't have lived with your boyfriend if you guys were that serious? It's 2024 couples live together for way less serious relationships.

Also it's not a bare minimum to explain every little move you make. That seems really exhausting and unnecessary.

Your boyfriend doesn't care about you, but I don't think it's something to lose your life over. There are tons of really great guys that can treat you well. I do understand how the negative treatment adds on when you were already dealing with abuse, though. It's so weird to me how people can know people are being abused and not think to do anything about it? Especially if he was supposed to be your fiance. At least you know you dodged a bullet with him.",2652258,,,,,,,,,,,,
I feel like I'm a piece of shit and CTB would be a selfless act,2652222,canyounotbesad,"Aug 30, 2024 at 10:10 PM","I know the title is edgy but, you know what? I'm feeling edgy.

I got put on 300mg of anti-depressants and I do not like 'em. I feel irritable and mad the moment I wake up. Also, and this is off topic, IDK if I have an ear infection or it's allergies but my head and ears feel full AF, the base of my neck hurts, and there is an almost non-stop ringing in my ears at night; grated, I'm sleeping much lower than normal as my mattress is on the floor 'cause I'm in the middle of moving. ANYWAY, at work I feel like a piece of shit. I know people care for me and worry about me at work and that makes everything so much harder. I want to be close to them, I want them to know I care about them as well and how I act isn't because of them. However, I can't. Any time I get into one of my moods, I shut down. I don't know how else to explain it besides going into autopilot. But, my autopilot is a dumb ass bitch. I had a friend, who knows enough of me to weigh in, ask me if I actually try in the moment. At first, I was like ""WTF of course I try, I'm obviously upset by how I am"" but then I thought of it, and I don't. Not because I don't want to, I just can't. My old therapist said I was resistant to therapy and that comment pops up in my head on every down swing, every bad moment. Every day the self-hatred grows. Even on anti-depressants I still hate myself! I just feel like killing myself and cutting myself less. It's at the point where I feel like the selfless act IS to CTB so I can ride every one of my existence. I know it's not depression at this point because I still feel the same way even after on drugs. Also, I know this is edgy as all hell and as I write this out I'm just thinking ""Jesus Christ woman fucking get it together"". But I can't. I can't get it together, if I could, I wouldn't be on this side to begin with; yet here I am.

I have this agreement with myself; to take it 1 year at a time. People say a lot can change in a year, so if by December 31st I still feel like shit, and have no desire to live, I will commit. No going back. Bur every year I find hope, a will to live, and it's like why!? I want to do right by people and the best way I know how is running away and living as a hermit in some podunk town OR CTB. Considering I don't have enough money to run away my only option is to CTB. But, I'm selfish. I'm selfish in the fact that I want someone to care about to me unconditionally. Is that reasonable or sane? No, it is not; but I want it nonetheless.


Look, I know my posts come off annoying and whiney and entitled, but this is honestly the only place I have to get this off my chest. If I'm going to cry, I would at least like someone to see it, not ignore me, and maybe relate to how I'm feeling. Right now, I can't CTB. My dad got plane tickets to come help me with my surgery so I can't do it until he leaves. I'm moving tomorrow and parking is strict at the new apartments so that should kill the only person that could/would check in on me if I didn't show up to work from coming by. I hope when I have my surgery, when I go under, that I find peace. Either in knowing I can die with no without guilt or in knowing I can live without shame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

One little thing you said: that you know it's not depression because you're on meds and still feel this way. I just wanted to say that it is very possible and common even for antidepressants to not fully (or at all) alleviate depression. So you sound like they aren't helping to their fullest potential.
I don't know if you have money for this but I HIGHLY recommend ketamine, whether that's infusions or spravato or whatever. It helps with neuroplasticity so it targets thoughts, not emotions and can work when antidepressants don't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a follow up with my doc in a few weeks as this is the trial period. I've talked about my surgery coming up so I won't regurgitate it, but my doc wants to make sure I'm ok before it. Which I'm insanely grateful for. It's just, idk and this may be so main character of me, I feel alone in this. It's all so new and scary and too much happening at once that I can't process it properly. Everyone is like ""oh go into therapy"" but, I have to save for surgery, I'm moving, I have to find a way to accommodate my dad, who is helping me after surgery, in a 1bedrom apt, working out how I will continue to work, full time mind you, and if I will take a good amount of time off, as well as manage my schoolwork. I just, IDK, I feel overwhelmed and my go to coping is cutting myself and other forms of SH, but I don't want to be that way. I genuinely want to be seen and heard but every time I am I freak out and ruin it. I wish I was dumber or stronger to weather this storm I really do but, I'm not.

So. I tried overdosing on random ass pills that my family doesn't need anymore- whatever was left in the container, and looked like it might kill me.
It ended up being like 10 pills at most.
I don't know what I was thinking? I was having a psychotic episode (My reoccurring one of being a fallen angel for some godforsaken reason. I've never been any flavor of Christian.) and had ""I need to go home"" as my only thought.
It didn't kill me, clearly.
It just came right back out a few hours later. Peaceful ""go to sleep and never wake up"" death this was not. Of course in my sober state I know that's not even how successful overdoses work. But desperate and psychotic me is a damn idiot.
I was able to just play it off as a stomach flu and lay in bed in regret and throw up my guts for a day. Nothing bad has happened yet. I feel mostly fine. A little out of it but I always am after an episode. Drank some electrolyte water and all that.
Honestly I don't remember what I took? For all I know it was just a supplement or something.

I've read that it can be painful but I've also read that it's very peaceful towards the end and the pein you get isn't that strong.

I would have died.

When you get hung over from alcohol, it's because your body is dehydrated. So, dying from lack of water is like a bad hangover. Honestly, I think I would prefer dying of thirst than a bridge or a gunshot. It sucks, but it's not THAT bad. Plus, you could probably load up on painkillers because it wouldn't intertere with your chosen method. I'm sure millions of humans have died of thirst over the years.",2634449,,,,,,,,,,,,

Living is so fucking overrated. I don't understand what is so fcking tabooo about simply not wanting to be here. What is so absurd and unthinakable about wanting to enter a state of nothingness without ever having to suffer, worry or stress about anything ever again. Sounds like paradise if you ask me. And isn't paradise what everyone longs for?

Every parent or person that is contemplating being a parent needs to seriously fcking think about this before bringing a child into this world against their free will.

Are you passing on desirable genes?

Are you financially able to provide a good life?

Do you have your own life together enough to even be thinking about being responsible for another for the rest of your own entire life?

Are you psychologically well enough to not constantly piss your children off or make them live in fear?

If the answer to any of these questions is no, and you still think it's ok to proceed with having children, then you are a stupid, demonic POS. Literally.



There was a thread I read here the other day about going under anaethesia and how it is probably the closest thing to experiencing a peaceful death. Euthansia in the form of anaethesia overdose needs to be legalized and made readily available. It's good for the people that don't want to be here and even better for the people remaining that want to live, after we are gone and no longer a burdens or menaces to society.

However if it's been 2+ years even if you leave a suicide note they'll still pay out.

Also, if you do plan to kill yourself within 2 years of starting the policy, the detectives who investigate your death will likely rule it as a suicide even if you don't leave a note as there will be other obvious signs, unless you put a lot of planning and effort into making it look like a genuine accident.

To answer the post question's question: No, I don't plan to leave a note. I don't see the point for two reasons. First, anything I write is going to be interpreted as the ravings of a deeply mentally ill person who killed themselves and will be brushed off, having no real impact on anyone who reads it.

I know they're working; instead of having full on depressive episodes I now have LaCroix depression. I know it's there but it's only a faint whiff of it, not enough for me to really be affected, ya know? While I'm grateful the intensity has been turned down, I still have the urge to CTB. It's not as demanding as before but it is still there and, truthfully, it affirms that I am beyond saving. I mean therapy didn't work and medicine doesn't fully work. I hope that, when I can, therapy and medicine will be the combo to help me. I want to feel 'normal', I want to feel the slight buzz I get from 2 drinks where I can still function but I'm relaxed and happy all the time. I don't want to be angry and frustrated and sad all the time. I don't want my neutral days to be plagued with though of CTB. I want to have only happy things to say to my friends and to not burden them with my problems. As it stands, though, I do burden them. My days are plagued by CTB thoughts. I feel like I only feel anger and sadness every day. The bestt anology I have is a campfire.

There is a campfire, and everyone is gathered around, telling stories and laughing. They're all at a comfortable distance from the fire; not too close to burn but not too far to be cold. It's nice and warm. Before I was on medicine I was sitting in the fire and every time I spoke fire and smoke came from my mouth, burning everyone. I was hurting, my friends and family were hurting. On medicine, I feel like I am 20 feet away from everyone. I have a megaphone so I can still talk to the people around the campfire and understand what they say but I feel no warmth. I feel like being outside is pointless at this point. I might as well go home and play a 5-hour campfire video on YouTube and text them; it will give me the same feeling.

I'm appreciative of this site. I'm glad I have a spot to yell into the void and not be yelled back at. I don't have to worry about you finding out who I am or where I live. I don't have to fear consequences that would come if I said this stuff to someone I know or anywhere else online. And you understand. You know what I mean. I don't feel like I've had that before. Like, I had a mental breakdown in high school, to the point the school called home, and no one helped me then. I got yelled at by my parents and told to get therapy. Mind you, I was about 16. No one helped me. No one comforted me. They just yelled at me for not being able to manage. The real kicker, which I find kinda funny, is that my mom went through similar trials. I see her scars. I've heard the stories of how her mom didn't listen to her and how she hated it. Yet she does the same. My family is part of the reason I don't want kids. I don't want to pass down these accursed genes. I don't want to scar someone who had no say in being born. It's wrong and cruel. I don't know where I'm going with this post anymore.... I'll be honest I mainly get on here when I feel really bad, and I've been drinking. Selfish, I know. But, like I said, it helps. Eases my mind even if it's just for a little.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

What if blowing my head of will feel like an eternity? [trigger warining],2642303,NotesFromTheShadow,"Aug 22, 2024 at 7:18 PM","So, I used to be very sure about my method - gun - for a few reasons. Quick, simple, effective. Plus, I like guns. I've shot some guns in the past. I think they're kinda cool. Plus I have easy access to guns since I don't have any mental health diagnoses, nor criminal record.
I also kinda romanticised the idea of ""going with a bang.

Until...

I wanted to know as much as I could about the actual experience of blowing your own head off so, I looked up some footage of public suicides. (Google doesn't give out this information too easily but if you dig a bit you'll find some.) And one particular video changed my mind about it altogether. It's from Ricardo López aka the Björk stalker who blew his head off in a vlog. I really do not recommend watching that video. It's agonizing.

I'm not gonna go into details about the video but it seems like the most brutal and painful experience ever. Especially the audio of it. It just seems like a very log and painful struggle, even though it's just a few seconds. This gave me so much chills and makes me wonder:

What if, in such a situation our perception of time slows down so, it'll feel much longer and will be agony, despite the rational belief of it being quick. Because, that's a thing, right? Our perception of time can slow down. For instance when we're in a very painful or adrenalin-loaded situation. I was in a car crash once and even though the whole situation was just a couple of seconds it felt like minutes to me.

Even the possibility of this gives me the fucking chills, so the gun - method is off the table for me.

I feel people try to force false hope onto us, whether that's trying to convince us good things can happen or telling us to try and focus on the positives. I think they do this to make themselves feel better if we are still alive.

Life is arbitrary and good things are as likely to happen as bad. Some people place their bets on the good stuff happening; others can't do this for whatever reason. The irony is that if you place your bets on the good stuff happening, it becomes more likely, and it will get you through the bad stuff.

Fuck Therapy I Want Revenge,2650223,escape_from_hell,"Aug 29, 2024 at 12:59 PM","I have the experience that the only periods where life has treated me well have been those times I was an absolutely amoral piece of selfish shit with little regard for others. Not talking about something like selfishness leading to better self-care. Talking about external luck, serendipity. Things like more opportunities, money, willing sexual partners, people loving and caring about me deeply and genuinely, less physical pain, the whole nine.

The more caring, moral, and good-natured periods are marked by being loathed, mistreated, disregarded, invisible, horrible luck, poor value for efforts made, physical sickness and ailments, that sort of thing.

This is purely anecdotal and I don't want to encourage magical thinking, but I have occasionally read similar experiences from others--where periods of actively being a bad apple yielded a far more loving and rich life than the straight and narrow. So yeah, I don't want to say there is some mystical stuff going on but my own lived experiences have illustrated pretty clearly that the nature of being (itself a mystical mystery) is geared towards EVIL. Maybe the life lesson we are supposed to take is to be as evil as possible, as that is what nature rewards? Then the only pain is moral pain, the tears of which can be wiped away with the hundred dollar bills like the top of the top do.",2650152,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can be the most selfish person and put yourself first always and willing to hurt anyone who want to hurt you. it doesn't have to be hurting innocent people. It just mean that not letting anyone ever hurt you. People have the wrong idea of what it means to be good or bad.

Fuck Therapy I Want Revenge,2650369,mythofsisyphus,"Aug 29, 2024 at 2:52 PM","I think the harsh reality is, what you've described is the opposite of revenge. Clearly someone or something has hurt you deeply, and I'm so sorry. Life is so incredibly cruel and unfair. It's so natural to want to revenge, to become bitter and resentful, I get it completely. But is that what you, the you underneath all the hurt and trauma, would want? I'm not suggesting the alternative is you become a 'better' person, that you use the pain to reach enlightenment and be transformed. In many ways, this would be doing the same thing as seeking revenge - not wanting the feelings you have, wanting to get rid of them and turn them into something else.

Maybe there's another way.. maybe these people have already taken enough from you. Maybe you can find a way to exist with the pain, without needing to channel it into revenge or self improvement, carrying it with you but not letting it define you and what's important to you. Before all this happened, what did you value? What mattered? Can you find a way back to these things, in some way.

I'm a weird way, I think letting go of your need for revenge, is possibly the best revenge you can get.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fuck Therapy I Want Revenge,2650386,etherealgoddess,"Aug 29, 2024 at 3:09 PM","I have done revenge, and sometimes, it's good. I had a so-called friend spread all of my most personal information, so I did the exact same thing back to her so everyone found out about all of her business, told other people about her tendency to lie, humiliated her online, and not only that, I even confronted her online but was smart enough to leave out enough details so she didn't know how much I knew, so she ended up going to my face to confront me and when I told her I did all this garbage to her because I found out about everything she did to me, the arrogant confidence on her face and her whole agenda to bully me was wiped off in an instant and she ran away HAHAHAHHAA. Best revenge I've ever had. For context, I had never done anything to this girl. It was clear she was insecure and wanted to ruin my reputation for her own ego because she bonded with other insecure, mean people. I know she's had a hard life, but that doesn't change the fact that her behaviors were reckless and morally irresponsible.

Revenge is good for some people who are so ridiculously evil and believe they can keep going. It was a lesson to her and everyone around her—don't be surprised if someone backlashes after you gossip about them. Every time she thinks about betraying someone, she WILL think of me. I will say, though, I had nothing to lose, so I did it. I wasn't in that environment anymore, but someone was telling me abt what was going on. I'd be careful about revenge because if this person has a ton of social influence and a lot of people like them, you need to take it slow or else it can backfire. You also need to be careful if you're in the same environment.

A good safety net is creating a group of people who you bond with in a group. I didn't have that many times, and that made me a lot more prone to being bullied.",2650152,,,,,,,,,,,,

How many of you are socially anxious?,2650532,esistzeit,"Aug 29, 2024 at 5:45 PM","Because I was bullied and sexually abused during childhood, I grew up scared of people and unable to connect with them.

My social skills are non-existent and this has had several negative impacts on my life.

Even simple things like going out to the store makes me nervous. To this day, I get really anxious whenever I go past a school and see several students hanging around; I'm always thinking that they are going to make fun of me.

But I am still human in nature and I miss this connection. I tell myself I am an introvert but, upon reflection, maybe I was forced into that position because many of my human interactions were unpleasant, so I learned that being alone didn't hurt as much.

The kind of hyper vigilance that trauma can cause is really hard to deal with, especially as it seems to carry on with us long after the traumas happened. I can definitely understand how this affected your social skills.

I really relate to you. I deal with a lot of hyper vigilance myself as well due to abuse and bullying in early childhood, adolescence, and psychiatric trauma from adolescence to now.

I grew up an only child in a really small family. It has been only my parents and my grandmother since I was 4, until I got my two dogs when I was older. I was always an outcast for lots of reasons and was always isolated. I was always around adults.

So yeah I have always been really isolated. I don't even talk to people online. The most I do is comment on posts whether that be forums or on people's art online. I don't do discord or voice chat when gaming. Just too much anxiety and distrust with people. Also just listening to the people on voice chat reminds me of school and I am like yeah, no thanks.

It is so hard being isolated though. I'm sorry you go through this. I hope you can find some sort of support that works for you",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just the thought of trying to communicate with a random person often sends me into a downwards spiral.

It's caused me to automatically hate most people.

What really fucking sucks is that I was finding it easier to communicate with people online, but now my anxiety has become worse and has started affecting me socialising on the internet too. It's made me feel more alone which i absolutely fucking despise.

I often spend all day just laying on my bed and overthinking. Talking with pretty much anyone always send me into a depressive and panicked state, if not a downwards spiral of mental breakdowns.

I also get the feeling of being a burden when you try to vent with someone, after all... I do sound like a broken record, playing again and again the same words, the same feelings, the same thoughts. And... Let's not lie ourselves, people get sick of it.

They don't seem like the kind of people you need around you, so ask yourself if you want to keep them around.

Again, you're not awful and if you did not make something really awful... You deserve to be loved.

If you think like I usually do about myself... Let me be a little crude and clear: It's not a crime that we where born, it's not a burden for us to keep living. We may feel like that, but that's not true.

It'll sound cliché, but if you're capable of... Love yourself. And give you the opportunity to be around people that make you feel better.

Although most of us here want to end it all... I wish you find a better alternative.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ctb with morphine - panicking about method - please help!,2652074,yaxleyblue,"Aug 30, 2024 at 7:31 PM","I have 2 full 200ml bottles of liquid oromorph, each containing 200mg of morphine. I believe from research that never having taken opioids before, that 200mg should be enough to ctb. However, how can I successfully achieve this? Apparently to take orally, I'm likely to throw most back up yet 200ml is too large an amount to inject in one syringe or administer rectally, again due to size of feeding syringe. It's the only peaceful method I have access to. Can anyone please advise? Do I need to take anything else with it to ensure success such as vodka or other tablets? I do have access to a small number of Buprenorphine skin patches but these are slow release so have doubts that these will have any positive effect.

I want to kill myself because I hate myself so much but I can't,2623385,ur8ndom,"Aug 7, 2024 at 3:14 PM","I did a lot of evil things in my past and I hurt the person I love the most. I manipulated her in my favor, she was like my sister. We were together for 5 years, learned hacking together and we had a lot of things in common. She was the first person who understood me. But still I manipulated her our whole relationship, I played with her feelings, I put her down, gaslighted her without realizing it. We were coding on an app together, it was my dream. In the beginning I tried to convince her to have a threesome with my dream girl but I just tried to get hold of her so I can leave her. I betrayed her emotionally our whole relationship. She denied but years later, when we were coding on our app, we actually were clean from amphetamine, studied and hit the gym, it was the first time I felt a glimpse of happiness, she went partying, came home and said, ""guess, whose number I got for a threesome"". She had the number of my dream girl. At first I denied, I said I don't want to destroy things but then I saw her image on whatsapp and all my feelings came back up and I said ok, lets do this. We invited her and she was in but I felt more than just sexual attraction, my ex got jealous and we stopped. I proposed to my ex and asked her if I could have sex with my dream girl before we marry. Fuck I was playing with her, I wanted to see if I can have her. She reacted positively when I asked her and I knew our relationship is over. And then things got messy, I threw my ex out, manipulated her into talking to my dream girl, fuck, I didn't even help her finding a new flat or moving, I quit my studies, I ruined our project. We made a lot of money and she was the disciplined part of us but I told her, she doesn't deserve more than 30%. I was convinced that I'm in right. I started a relationship with my dream girl, she went through a crisis at this point, too, she was unemployed, had a mental health crisis and hadn't found her path yet. I manipulated her, too, I wanted to move away with her to get away from my ex, because I felt so guilty and to isolate her and have her under my control. After a few weeks of hanging out together, she wanted to have a relationship with me but I sabotaged it because I felt so guilty, I hurt her really badly and wanted to get back to my ex. At this point she didn't want to have me back anymore. Things got messy, we started stalking each other, I started to use tinder, she had a new boyfriend who also was a psycho and hit her. She got crazier and crazier, it hurt so badly to see her like this. I lost my flat, I was on the streets for a while but found a new flat. After 1 1/2 years she found a new boyfriend who treated her nicely. I thought when she is happy I can work on myself and get back my dreamgirl. I started to write a book about my story - it was a dream of mine - but then realized that I was a terrible person. I turned completely crazy. I started to drink alcohol, got really impulsive, I did a lot of things against my values. I stalked multiple women who actually used to adore me until I landed at the psychward. I promised to myself to work on myself there and build a routine and get back on track but I didn't. I secretly drank, I distracted myself with a woman I met there, I ruined my passion project, I wrote my dream girl nasty stuff on insta. After I got out, I got a call from the police, she complained to them because of stalking. I had spent all my savings, I ruined a project that was really important to me, my ex wrote me that I'm a bad person and she doesn't want me in her life anymore. I hit rock bottom badly. I was in a fucking dark place for 2 years, I realized that I was a bad person my whole life. I only ate donuts and smoked cigarrets and watched porn for a year, I barely left the flat. I felt like all my dreams died, I felt, like I can't ever make up for all the things I had done and forgive myself. I started to insult myself and became really self destructive. Then I met a menthor, I knew him from before, he went through a similar story. He got back on his feet, became successfull and turned things aroung, he's now a philantropist and married. I started to hit the gym and tried to make money but I kept feeling like shit. The only thing that made me happy was to think about how I should have behaved. An ideal self emerged and I knew whom I wanted to be the first time but didn't realize it. It was like a compulsion, I couldn't stop thinking about the could have beens. I wanted to kill myself. But then I got into a private clinic. There I realized that it was possible to transform myself if I just could manage to forgive myself. I created a vision of myself and whom I wanted to be but I just couldn't forgive myself. I met another woman there, told her my story, she acccepted me anyways and wanted me to live with her. Eventhough I knew it was wrong, I threw my vision away and made plans to move to her city. At the same time I realized that I could do everything I wanted to do when my ex had her new boyfriend now, I realized that I can work on myself and become the best version of myself and then apologize to my ex and my dream girl. When I made a plan how to reach my goals and how to go the redemption ark the first time, suddenly all the pain, all the cognitive dissonance was gone, I got out of the dark place I was in. But I sabotaged myself on purpose. I thought I failed. I applied for another clinic because I thought, I don't really want it subconciously but after a month of waiting, the suicidal ideation came back. I visited a old friend and stayd with him and smoked weed because it made the thoughts of self harm go away. When I was with him I realized that I can still do everything now, I went back to my hometown but then I immediately gave up, I smoked weed with my neighbour, I gave in to self doubt. I got self destructive again. Then in april I woke up with the words ""It's about my ex, it's about my whole future"" and started working towards my goals for just one day and I got a massive forward momentum. I aligned my actions with my newly found values and goals and I felt happy and joyful for the first time. My intuition came back. I knew I was on the right path. But then I had a setback. I got self loathing. I realized that I hate myself because I'm not walking my highest path. But instead of realigning my actions with mky values and goals, I kept doing the things that made me loath myself I got into a self destructive cycle and drained myself completely. This was in may. Since then I was leying in bed, asking myself, ""should I kill myself or not"". The voice in my head is back, telling me to kill myself every second. When I work towards my goals I don't feel better, I feel that I ruined my path to redemption irreperabely and I really feel like I can't become the man I want to be anymore, I feel like I can't reconcile with my past, with my ex (my best friend) and my dream girl. I feel like I can't ever forgive myself for finding my way out of this dark place, regaining my intuition but then throwing myself off course completely. I could enjoy food, nature and exercising again in the beginning of the year, now I just feel numb and weighed down by guilt and shame. My mentor doesn't want to see me anymore, everyone lost believe in me and I feel unable to move forwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I want to kill myself because I hate myself so much but I can't,2629764,Cress,"Aug 13, 2024 at 12:40 AM","The fact that you are able to have such a tremendous amount of introspection into Your own motivations Is way more than most evil people ever get. Regardless if you consider yourself evil or not it's not really anyone's place really to judge. Lots of people have done terrible things and I don't think they deserve to suffer or hate themselves. You're not the same person that you were even a few weeks ago. If you want to really get technical you effectively die when you go to sleep and some other person you don't know takes over.

You're deserving of compassion just as much as anyone else one thing you could potentially try is thinking of yourself as another person. Some people find it easier to have compassion for others instead of themselves. So if you just view yourself as someone that you're taking care of it might make things a little bit easier. Technically it's true you really only occupy the brain and the rest of your body is depending on you to keep it safe.

I have really terrible and dark traits of my own People either find me really interesting to talk to or they think my attitude and view of the world is appalling. Finding me really difficult to be around. It can be really difficult when you get a chain reaction on multiple people projecting you one after the other however it's important to realize that you have positive and negative traits.

""I cannot live when my Motherland is dying and when everything I have considered the meaning of my life is being destroyed. My age and my experiences give me the right to die. I fought till the end.""

-Sergei Akhromeyev (1923-1991), hanging

——

""No one has yet written candidly of the mental state of one who is to commit suicide.This may be due to the self-respect of the suicide victim, or perhaps a lack of psychological interest in his
own state of mind. In this, my final letter to you, I will endeavour to make clear my mental state. But even if I should fail to convey my motives to you accurately, I will still be satisfied in the attempt. In one of his short stories, Régnier depicts a man who commits suicide, but does not himself understand for what reason. You can find many motivations for suicide in the police section of the newspaper, from fiscal hardship or ill health to mental anguish. In my experience these do not represent the totality of motives, but only speak of the journey towards the true reason. Those who commit suicide are for the most part as Régnier depicted, unaware of their real motivation. Suicide, as with all our actions, involves a complexity of motives. In my case, I am driven by, at the very least, a vague sense of unease: some indistinct sense of unease towards my future. It is possible that you will not be able to take me at my word. Ten years of experience have taught me that for those who are not my close and constant acquaintances, my words
dissipate like a song in the wind. So I would not blame you…

For the past two years I have thought incessantly of death. It was also during this period that I
read Mainländer, whose work has become deeply ingrained in my consciousness. I am certain
that Mainländer quite ingeniously depicts the journey towards death, couched in abstract words. I want to depict the same in a more concrete form. I have no greater desire than this, not even
sympathy to my family. This might seem to you nothing less than ""inhuman,"" but if you deem me
inhuman, know that I am only superficially so.

I am duty bound to write all this honestly (I feel that I have already made every effort to examine
my vague sense of unease towards my future in ""A Fool's Life."" In it, I deliberately chose not to write about a certain social factor whose shadow still hangs over me – the feudal era. This is
because we humans are even today living in its shadow to some extent. I tried to write only of the
scenery, lighting, and actors – for the most part my own acting – that appeared on other stages
than that one. Besides, I could not but entertain doubts as to whether I myself could clearly
understand this social condition while living in the midst of it). My primary concern was how to
die in such a way as to minimize suffering. Hanging is, of course, the most appropriate method
for this purpose. But when I lingered on the image of my own dangling form, I was overcome by
a lavish feeling of aesthetic disgust (I remember a time when I loved a certain woman, but lost
my feelings towards her when I found her to be a poor writer). Drowning, too, could in no way
achieve my goal, as I am an able swimmer. Even in the unlikely event that I succeeded, it would
prove more painful than hanging. The thought of throwing myself beneath a train evoked in me
more than anything that sense of aesthetic revulsion. Death by a pistol or a knife held the
potential for failure due to the trembling of my hands. Leaping from a building would no doubt
be unsightly. Based on these considerations, I settled upon death brought on by a drug. It is
possible that death by a drug may be more painful than hanging. However, aside from the fact
that I find it less abhorrent than hanging, it also holds the benefit that there is no danger of
resuscitation. There only remained the issue that procuring such a drug would be, needless to say, no simple task for me. I set myself upon suicide, and resolved to use every means at my disposal to acquire the drug. At the same time, I tried to gain what knowledge I could have of toxicology.

My thoughts then turned to where I would take my life. My family would have to rely on my
inheritance after my death: a meagre property that would amount to only one hundred tsubo of land, my house, the rights to my work, and my savings of two thousand yen. I was anxious about my house becoming unmarketable because of my suicide, and accordingly felt a sense of envy towards the bourgeois who had even a single country house. You might find my saying such a thing quite ridiculous. But when thinking of these matters, one in reality feels a deep sense of awkwardness. It is an unavoidable awkwardness. I wanted to make every effort to kill myself in such a way that no one outside my family would see my corpse.

Even after I had settled on the means, however, I found I still clung to life in some limited way.
Accordingly, I needed a springboard to propel me into death (I do not believe as the westerners do that suicide is a sin. In the Buddhist scriptures, the Buddha affirms the suicide of one of his disciples. Some who distort the truth to cater to public sentiment might say that this applies only in circumstances where such assent is ""unavoidable."" But seen from another perspective, these
""unavoidable"" circumstances are not just the extreme cases where one would inevitably die a
more miserable death. Anyone who chooses to take their own life does so as a result of
circumstances which are, to them, ""unavoidable."" If anything, those who do it before that point
must have an abundance of courage). When all is said and done, it is typically a woman who fills the role of this springboard. Kleist, prior to taking his own life, solicited his friends to become his
companions. Racine also tried to cast himself into the river Seine together with Molière and
Boileau. Unfortunately, I have no such friends as these, so I merely tried to convince a woman
with whom I was acquainted to die by my side. This, however, turned out to be a proposal she
could not undertake for my sake, and I soon became confident that I could take my life without a
springboard. This did not come about from despair that no one wished to die with me; rather, I
was becoming increasingly sentimental, and even if my wife would be bereaved of me in death, I wanted to be considerate towards her. At the same time, I knew that killing myself would be
simpler without an accomplice. What's more, there was doubtlessly a convenience in being able to take my life at the time of my choosing.

My final device was to end my life in such a way that my family would not notice before the
deed was done. After several months of preparation, I attained a certain confidence that I would
be able to do so (I cannot write these details here for the sake of those people who care about me.
But even if I did write it here, it is certain that no charge as ludicrous as ""aiding and abetting
suicide"" would ever be created under our law. If this law were applied, how the number of
criminals would increase! Even if the pharmacies, gun shops, and razor sellers claimed that they
did not know, as long as our words and expressions betray our true intentions they would receive
some measure of suspicion. Besides, society and the law and such have themselves necessitated this aiding and abetting of suicide. In the end what kind hearts most of these criminals would have!). I carried out these preparations calmly, and now merely entertain myself with the thought of death. My mood before it is for the most part as Mainländer wrote.

We are human animals and thus fear death as animals do. The so-called ""will to live"" is nothing
more than a different name for animal instinct. I am but one of these human animals, and when I
observe my loss of interest in food and women, I realize I have gradually lost this animal instinct.
Now I reside in a world of diseased nerves, as translucent as ice. Last night I spoke with a
prostitute about her wages (!) and felt deeply the pathos of we humans who ""live for the sake of
living."" If we can submit ourselves to that eternal slumber, we can doubtlessly win ourselves
peace, if perhaps not happiness, but I had doubts as to when I would be brave enough to take my life. In this state, nature has only become more beautiful than ever to me. You love the beauty of
nature, and would no doubt scoff at my contradictions. But nature is beautiful precisely because it falls upon eyes that will not appreciate it for much longer. I have seen, loved, and understood more than others. This alone grants me some measure of solace in the midst of insurmountable sorrows. Please keep this letter from being made public for several years after my death. It is possible that I may take my life in a way that appears to be a natural death.

PS. Reading the life of Empedocles, I realized what an ancient desire it is to make oneself a god. As far as I can tell, this letter does not attempt that. No, I exist only as a mundane human being. Perhaps you recall twenty years ago when we discussed ""Empedocles on Etna"" under the linden trees. At that time, I was one who fancied himself a god.""

Guide on anchor points to look for in an Airbnb for full suspension hanging,2642684,Evelyn Lane,"Aug 23, 2024 at 6:10 AM","Maybe you wish to hang yourself at an Airbnb, in case you don't want to hang yourself outside and don't want to use the dumbbell method.

The reason I say Airbnb instead of hotel is because hotels don't usually have a valid anchor point for full suspension.

As we already know, finding a suitable anchor point for full suspension hanging indoors is a big challenge, so I decided to make a comprehensive list of potential anchor points to look for in an Airbnb in case you want to hang yourself in one using full suspension:

1) Door frame with a gap above and below it.
Example: https://hostingkartinok.com/show-image.php?id=a8b6ca97f6b2854362de4c0da3993d72

2) High enough window security bars.

3) Handrail placed on a floor above.
Example: https://videos.watchpeopledie.tv/1716292857408091.mp4

4) Ceiling fan (I hear only Asian ceiling fans are sturdy)

5) Wood beams on the ceiling

6) Sturdy shower rod

7) Staircase
Example: https://hostingkartinok.com/show-image.php?id=7f336a94d5648f31faad130a6d0b0cd6

9) Suitable hook on the ceiling

10) Private balcony's handrail (facing a floor below and not facing pedestrians)

11) Tree in the garden

12) Swing in the garden


I think with this I've covered the vast majority of anchor points for full suspension hanging available to anyone.
As you can see, you have lots of options in terms of anchor points: now you can hang yourself using full suspension regardless of whether you have money or not, have a home or not, or have privacy at home or not. It's all up to you and your initiative now.

I hope you found this information useful!



This thread is part of my complete guide on how to hang yourself, which you can find here:
Evelyn's complete guide on how to hang yourself with both partial and full suspension hanging
Are you new to hanging? Or maybe just trying to find out if hanging is the right method for you? This reading guide has you covered! This is your one stop shop to both partial suspension hanging and full suspension hanging. This is a reading guide to the guides I published on this forum so far...

Thoughts,2651725,PinballWizard39,"Aug 30, 2024 at 2:09 PM","I guess it comes as no surprise that if I'm on this website, I'm in a pretty dark place. That place has become darker over the last few months and I just don't think I have it in me to carry on. Whilst it's no secret I struggle with ambivalence, that doesn't take away how serious I am. A few days ago I was forced to admit by professionals that I had plans that included researching, buying SN, storing it and prepping to CTB. A few weeks back I was trying to get support from their helpline and got frustrated because the woman was downplaying how I felt. I ended up blurting out that I had bought SN in all but name. I regretted it immediately, and thankfully it looked like no one was bothered. From what I gather, it was noted and someone looked through my notes a few days ago and realised that was never followed up on and so as a result, I've ended up with the crisis team. They've said that they need to try and manage my risk and will come see me every other day and possibly brings worksheets for me to work on. It's ridiculous. It actually just confirms to me that there is nothing anyone can do and no one seems bothered if I want to end my life.

Today has been weird. Every motion I've done, it's felt like the last time I'll be doing x, y and z. I had a half day at work and I just found myself saying goodbye to people in my mind, wondering what they'd say when they hear the news that I'm not here anymore. I've been restricting my food/fluid intake to practically nothing and take meto just on the 'safe side'. I'm not 100% that I'll do it today, but the percentage has to be in the 90's.

I made one last attempt to try and see if there was some help this afternoon. I told the crisis team I wasn't safe, and all I got was 'distraction techniques', and 'just get through til tomorrow and we'll come see you'. Why? What for? What am I hanging on in there for? My depression never goes away, merely fluctuates. There is no pay off for distraction anymore, just more suffering that nobody can take away. I done with all the 'maintenance' techniques (distraction, self care etc), it's either I get better or nothing. It's been 27 fucking years. Haven't I fought enough?

Taking me out of the situation for a moment, how shit is it that the crisis teams can know all the details like this, and yet still be fine with saying 'see you tomorrow' - you'll be lucky. Every conversation with you reinforces why I just can't do this anymore or much longer.
Whilst I haven't named this site, I am still paranoid they might come to find my posts. Then again, you never know, they might actually not be all that bothered.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Thoughts,2651788,Grumble,"Aug 30, 2024 at 3:04 PM","Are you wanting to be admitted, or...?

Crisis teams look for three factors. All three factors, present at the time of the intervention:
You have a specific plan. Not ""I'm feeling suicidal"" or ""I want to kill myself."" A detailed plan.
You have ready access to the means to carry out the plan.
You intend to carry out the plan in the immediate short-term future.
They need to be able to document all three of these in detail to justify the admission, especially if it's on an involuntary (or ""voluntary involuntary"") basis.

Now, if a crisis team reaches you and you're in such an obviously distraught state that they can't even get all these details out of you, they may go ahead and bring you in anyway, but generally speaking, they're going to need those details before they can proceed.",2651725,,,,,,,,,,,,

I told my psychologist i won't
I told my therapist I won't

Thurday I sat on my therapist couch. I said I cannot stop thinking about suicide. I cannot stop thinking about my funeral. I cannot stop researching methods. I dont want therapy anymore. I have given up. I do therapy to pacify my family and friends.

We did a roleplay where my therapist pretended to be me. What advice I would give myself. I had no advice. I just stood there, awkwardly laughing it off.

So the advice was no more suicide topics online or in music or in films.

But today my dear mother told me she lost the two boxes from my deceased father. And the few items of my father I kept should be shared with my sister since she lost all the other stuff.

My mom tends to lose things. I gave her my savings in cash. When I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital and lost my house. Guess what, she lost it.
And now my father's stuff. Lost it.

It should not surprise me. But it did. I cant even be mad. Im just sad.

I think I'm done.,2651950,Glazed_Orange,"Aug 30, 2024 at 5:39 PM","I can't really think of too many reasons to live, the only reason I've carried on is because of Ace. Ace is my dog and is sweet as can be, and has always been there for me. Even though I was never the best, I've had outburst and have even been violent with him. I regret it all, and even if it's hard to understand, I never meant to hurt him. It was almost like a switch, but I love him with all my heart and I'm sorry

All I remember from life is very little, there was nothing but violence and disrespect, and every year that passes, I've forgotten most of it. I've never wanted anything except love and a place to belong. But I can't have that, and the world we live in, is a selfish. I keep thinking, even if I find love, what then? Life is just a series of patterns, and nothing really important can ever come from it. you're happy, and then you die is the best case scenario. Then there's the horrible route of suffering and pain, which is what most about everyone get's nowadays. You work, have some fun, and sleep. But mostly it's just struggling, and I don't think there's a single person who looks forward to that. I'd prefer to just dream forever if I could, I'd play games, watch games, even learn and help everyone I could. I don't like to be forced to survive, as I was never given the choice. Everyone owns something, and there's nowhere in the world to be free.

I really don't know what to do, and for a long time I've wondered if suicide would be a good option. At that point, there's not a whole lot to worry about. I can't find the reason to keep living, and would prefer to go to a desert and see those beautiful stars and just kill me and my dog. I know that's fucked up, and given what I said earlier may have really offended some people. I just want to be honest, something I was never given a chance to do. I want to die, but at the same time, I find myself wanting to live. I don't even know why, when suicide is the easier option.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Under appreciated,2651914,Iris Blue,"Aug 30, 2024 at 4:58 PM","Not towards anyone here I just need to vent.

I do not feel like I am as important to you anymore. Sure, I do understand once people get into their own romantic relationships they have higher priorities. But I was here first. It used to be just us. I used to mean something to you. I try not to be selfish, I try to make sense of it all, buts it hard to be rational when it feels unequal.

Suddenly you don't have time for me anymore, it's also me asking to hangout or just making any effort in the our relationships. You don't want to do things with me that you would for them in a heartbeat. I get that people have multiple relationships. But what I don't get is how they can just easily push aside and forget about the ones they had before. The ones that were supposedly unbreakable. Just because you found your ""new toy"" doesn't mean you should throw me away.

I've known one of you half my life and the other my entire life. Far longer than your current lover. I want to be with you. I want to spend time. But I feel so awful about it all that it feels like I'm a burden if I would even try or that you would just look my way out of pity. It's happened multiple times the same situation with both. I know I probably sound ridiculous and maybe I am. But I don't think it is so unreasonable when the same thing has happened multiple times and the signs seem so obvious.

You have your new person. I'm happy for you that's all I want as long as you're happy that's what's important to me. It makes it so much easier for me to be able to go without worrying that you won't have someone else with equal if not more importance.

Very early in our relationships I knew I would die for you. Heck, I'd even live for you… but now it's time for me to die for myself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But, it did look more dense than the SN that I got from another source that I haven't been able to tell the purity of either.

I decided to drink it to see what effects there would be. Wasn't anything other than the salt water taste for the first few minutes.
Within about 10 minutes I felt my heart start racing, my vision started to black out a few times. Like when you stand up too fast but I was sitting down.
Felt a little quezzy around that time and let myself vomit about half of it.
After about 20-25 minutes I felt a little bit like I was having a hard time moving correctly and felt like I needed to take a nap.
Still no pain at all at this point.
I was unconscious for about 8 hours after I made it to my bed.
When I woke up I was messed up. My forehead felt really hot. My eyes and ears were messed up. Had a hard time with coordination and took all my concentration to make it to the bathroom. A bit of confusion as my mind was going in circles over something pointless.
That lasted for about a day before it went away.

From what you've shared, it sounds like you have a strong support system with your boyfriend and friends. They genuinely care about you and want to see you in the best mental state possible. I'm confident that your boyfriend will stand by you for as long as you need him, offering his support and love.

I encourage you to keep pushing forward, even when it feels overwhelming. Remember, it's okay to take things slowly and focus on the small victories. Your life has so much potential, and while things may feel heavy now, there could be a time in the future when you look back and realize how far you've come.

As an aside, why do you care what your friends think? Once you punch your ticket I doubt you'll be thinking of them, or of much of anything. Suicide should be your decision and done on your terms.",2650858,,,,,,,,,,,,

I used to believe in God but abandoned my beliefs a long time ago. I read the aforementioned book back in my believer days.

I'm so sorry you've got tinnitus, it is a very distressing condition. I'm also sorry that you really want to die but are scared of death.

I'm a literal disappointment to my parents. I could have been so much more than this. I came from a good family with a good education and a great background. It never should have come to this. I don't think there's any way out of this.
Every day since I found out about this in May has been literal torture. But realistically I was trying to kill myself before that. I want to believe that things will get better than this but I don't have any hope anymore. I feel like I wasted all my potential and there's no coming back from this.
I just fucked up another phone screening and I'm fucking spiraling again. I wish so badly that any of this was temporary.

I had so many chances to be better than this but I blew every opportunity and made so many bad choices and big mistakes. I just want so badly for this to be fixed and to be able to move on with my life but I really think that this is it. And it's so fucking sad that it's come to this. I can't stop crying about it because I don't know if I want to die but I don't see any other way out of this.

There's such a stigma around it that a large number of people just don't know how to react in a kind and supportive manner, or are afraid they'll somehow make it worse. The second reason is desensitization. They've heard you and others say things before and nothing came of it so they just become numb to it and ignore it as 'just venting'..

Personally, I am very much equipped to respond to the topic of suicidality as I've been living this hell for most of my life and can relate to and empathize with it all day long.

However. To engage someone about this requires a certain mindset. If we're just having a light, casual conversation, and you suddenly tell me about how you were thinking about killing yourself last night... That is a shell-shock ""whoa"" moment that is apt to stupefy even the most seasoned professionals. There is a process of reorientation that has to happen in order to make that transition from ""light chatter"" to the ""deep and dark"".

I think, in the moment, it would actually affect my ability to respond in a way that I'd want to respond. So much so that I might seem uncaring in the moment. And my thinking on this is, if this ""casual drop"" would catch ME off guard, then just imagine what it would do to the average person who has no personal experience with it.

Being so accustomed to suicidality, I have to be careful in my everyday life to avoid accidentally let something slip in a flippant manner. Yes, it's casual for us, but not for the average person, and for some people, you could shake the very foundation of their world by dropping this information at all, let alone catching them off guard with it.",2651559,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you want to have a serious conversation with them about your suicidal ideation then cut to the chase and open up about it.

Why do people feel angry at the person following a suicide?,2649640,Forever Sleep,"Aug 29, 2024 at 2:16 AM","I think, along with the grief, people do sometimes feel anger towards the person that took their own life. Why do you think that is?

I think maybe they're angry that they didn't try harder to live maybe. That they didn't do it for them- their love wasn't enough. I think also, it's that suicides must make us feel a whole bunch of unpleasant things we weren't prepared for- shock, grief, guilt. Maybe they're angry at being made to feel those things. Plus, it's a deliberatly inflicted act. We suicide knowing in some way what harm it will likely cause others. I'm sure that's terribly painful to accept.

Personally, I think that's why people are so keen to cling to ideas like- that person wasn't thinking clearly, they were so consumed by mental illness or depression. Or, they were influenced by the internet. Places like this. (The most extreme idea to my mind.)

Do you think people in your life would be angry with 'you' (obviously, you wouldn't exist anymore but, you know what I mean) if you did CTB? Do you think people have the right to feel angry? In terms of- I think we all feel what we feel- there's not much controlling it. But more- is it justified? How much should we feel obliged to live so as not to upset other people?

Maybe if they'd invested a lot of their time and care, even money- trying to make sure a person was ok. Maybe they also would feel angry that their 'investment' didn't pay off. Even then though, are we really indebted to anyone to live?

I feel that parents are more indebted to their children because they deliberately brought a life here that would be dependent on them. I'm not sure for the rest of us. We're here because a couple of people decided to bring us here. Beyond that, it's hard to live without forming bonds with people. We grow up in families, we're forced to go to school. It's not our 'fault' that we may have people that become attached to us. How much do we owe one another really though?

I suppose ideally, it would help if our attitudes towards death weren't so negative and fearful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why do people feel angry at the person following a suicide?,2649693,Holu,"Aug 29, 2024 at 3:29 AM","My two closest friends, one I had known for almost 8 years, who I had been close pre-transition, and even closer post took her life 6 or so months ago. The other I had known for about two years, and was also trans(I was the cissy in the two tfem group) and I had been helping her with her religious fam, and even paying for her HRT since she was illegal. She passed about 8 months ago. All three of us were very open about our ideas regarding suicide, and would regularly talk about methods, wanting the peace of nothingness, etc. However, we would always admonish one another for actually doing suicidal activities(practice hanging, putting a loaded gun in mouth for feels, swallowing multiple pills), since nobody wanted to see the other die even if we ourselves feel like it would bring us peace. It wasn't so much out of selfishness, but I think fear of being the last alive and alone. So much so, that in a way, we kinda kept a subtle bet of who could last the longest. Partially because of this neither of their deaths were expected, so much so that when the first died we harassed her hoping she was just 5150'd again. Eventually the family contacts responded, after about a day and a half. I got this news on my 21st birthday, while out in uni, alone yet stuck in a dorm with two others having to hide my grief. Two months later the other friend took her life, again, unexpected. I got the news concrete of her passing a bit later after talking with her mother.

To this day I message them both goodmorning and goodnight along with various other things throughout the day. I have felt grief and loss for people I shared experiences with, similarities with, and people stressed over and cared for. Nothing has ever came across as so horribly painful to me as losing both of my closest people. Idk why I ever thought it would be the same, that I would have complete acceptance knowing their decision was for their peace. And even having the perspective and belief of deaths kindness, and understanding the decision to its fullest I feel anger towards both of them. Love and hate are both strong emotions, and can occur at the same time. The unbelievable amount of pain I feel when I think of them is strong enough to make me mad, and at times upset with them. I feel betrayed and abandoned despite knowing it was not their intent. They wouldn't harm me, but they couldn't go on. But that still makes me upset. Upset at them for leaving and upset at myself for failing them.

Even more cursed is that I've always essentially been tethered since my mom is alive. I already wasn't sure if I could go through with suicide, afraid of hurting her. Even still a part of me was always prepared to even if she was still alive, almost knowing it would be inevitable. But losing both of my friends made that so much harder. I don't want to cause that pain to anyone, and so for the first time after years of scarcely even stressing the consequences I'm shook.

So to go back to your question and points. Yes I feel angry, very angry, but not simply out of hatred, but from the intensity of my love. I also want to mention that both were well versed in their chosen methods, and well prepared before any crisis. They knew what they wanted, and likely even when. Even if they were in distress at the moment of death, they were 100% thinking clearly. And even though I had invested most of my time and a considerable amount of money in both of them, I do not feel angry that I ""lost"" said investments or because I think they made a mistake. I feel angry because I adored them, cherished them, and loved them.

I hope that makes some sense.

I think that family being angry at the person who committed suicide is mainly when the act reflects poorly on them. It ruins their wholesome image and at the end of the day, when someone's kid or someone's wife commits suicide, it obviously draws a lot of attention and while things may have looked great on the surface, now people start talking and such and that can bother certain groups of people. I know that if I ctb, my dad is going to be really angry with me lol. Only cuz it ruins his image of an 'amazing person'. So thats what i think. On the whole, I think nobody cares when someone ctbs. Empathetic people would go, 'Oh thats such a shame' and yes it would be such a shame when a person commits ctb.

I think the usual reaction tho, instead of anger, in most families, would be sadness. And thinking, 'I wonder what I could've done to help', which is normal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sure, it's unavoidable that if I, or virtually anyone else, was to CTB people close to them would be (often) very shaken from that act, but as you said it's a natural feeling and not always something you just decide, for that reason I think it's ""justified"". The mainstream view and take on suicide that the average Joe has is ""suicide is ALWAYS bad"" and unless you live in severe pain it's hard to really sympathise and understand how others that struggle like this really feel. I wouldn't be mad at my hypothetical friends if they would be mad at me for CTBing if they're feeling like that just due to human nature.

Why do people feel angry at the person following a suicide?,2649737,BlackDoor,"Aug 29, 2024 at 4:14 AM","It's actually harder for me when a person passes and I know they wanted to live, than when I know they'd been wanting to ctb for quite some time. If it's not an impulsive act, even if I hate the fact that they're gone, I will try to respect their personal agency and their decision. The anger from suicide death for me, would not be at the person but moreso at the conditions surrounding them that did not enable them to thrive. This makes more sense to me than blaming them. It's not an easy thing to put an end to everything, the strength of that conviction must come from somewhere.

In general though, the anger at the person could come from many places, feelings of loss of control, guilt, anger for causing them pain or inconvenience etc. Grieving is a personal act for the griever, it's about mourning the loss of a relationship, what that looks like is different for everyone. Some people make it all about themselves, some people go through the motions and pretend to care more than they do, some people focus on who the person was and meant to them, and all the iterations over and in between.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think people feel betrayed, since you didn't die because of an accident or illness, instead you ended your own life. You did it, you're the one who made a unilateral decision that caused them a lot of pain. Unfortunately, I feel like some of these people should be mad at themselves for ignoring or not noticing/not taking seriously the struggles of the person who ctb, but instead they shift the blame (blame the person who ctb, internet, drugs, doctors, social media etc)

I personally feel more sadness when someone who loved life and wanted to live dies, than when a person who wanted to die, most likely suffered a lot and wanted to end their pain dies. Beyond the grief and pain, I would feel relieved that my loved one is no longer suffering.
I think they absolutely have the right to feel sad, lost, confused, angry, but to blame someone who has suffered enough as it is, instead of empathizing, is outrageous to me (ノ_ <、)

I Am Going To CTB Because I Was Born Female,2632415,OutOfThisBody,"Aug 15, 2024 at 3:29 AM","I don't know what I did to deserve being born as a woman. Literally everybody hates women and likes to see them fail, be embarassed, and get hurt. Women are so weak compared to men and were dominated by men for most of human history. Being a man is so much better.

I wish my parents killed me as a baby, it would have been the rational thing to do. China has had a history of female infanticide for 2000 years and their society was not hindered by this. They recognized that men were more valuable than women and so they killed many of their female babies. They put us in piles of trash or drowned us or left us alone to starve.

I cant live this half-life anymore, being half as strong as men, half as funny, half as good at leading, crying more and being more emotional and scared. Look it up, all of these are proven. Its worse than being dead to live this way, its an embarassment.

Womens' hormones during their reproductive years even make them more likely to have depression and mood swings than men, while testosterone has an antidepressant effect and increases motivation and risktaking. Men are biologically more brave and adventurous. Living as a woman is full of pain, including every month just for existing.Because of this even simply existing in a womans' body is worse.

Men are able to do much more interesting things because they are much stronger. Puberty makes men stronger and gives women the ability to give birth. Given the chance, I would have chosen to become stronger.

Men evolved to be hunters, protectors, and warriors in hunter-gatherer societies while women were gatherers and reared children. Men fought all the wars with other tribes and women were kidnapped from their villages after a war and taken as property because they were helpless to defend against their invaders. I would have preferred to be a hunter/warrior, of course, and be built that way. Men have the honour of being able to say their bodies are built for fighting.

Sexism started because women weren't able to fight off men who wanted to control them. Why be alive in a body that is so risky?

People may say they like women but what they mean is they like women who do what they want and behave how they want. Men dominate in relationships and in bed, while women submit. I don't want to submit, but if I don't people say its unnatural and no one will want me. Maybe it is, considering what I wrote before. So I can never be in a relationship in this body in the way I want.

From the stone age to 1950 or so women were prevented from making scientific discoveries, leading, and making contributions to society, and our society made many advances. So how can we say that women are valuable? How can we say that patriarchy is not justifiied? We have never even had a president thats a woman before in the U.S., or a female prime minister in Canada. No one wants to elect one.

The saddest thing is sometimes i catch myself accepting how many things I cant do, accepting a life where I am unfulfilled and limited this way, where I can't take risks and have adventures and enjoy what I want, (Most of the things I want to do have men in the vast majority of participants, including reddit) and it makes me sad. This is why I'm going to commit suicide. I can't live in this small, sad life and body anymore. I can't sit here and rot for 60 years.

Soon I will be diving headfirst onto the sidewalk from a high building. My weak woman's skull will shatter quickly and easily and my brains will spill out onto the concrete.

I'm waiting until my birthday in a month, and in the meantime I will try to do all the things that I enjoy and are on my bucket list. Even this proves hard however knowing I am stuck in this embarassing body in the meantime. I can't even go out at night to look at the stars in case I get raped or attacked. And its dangerous to do things alone as a woman. If I get attacked, people will blame me, wondering how I could be so stupid to have been out alone, been out in a new place, etc. So, maybe I should end it quicker.

My only hope of living how I want is if reincarnation exists, but even if it doesn't I still prefer being dead to being alive like this.

TL;DR, All of this is to say, I can't take the limited existance of being a woman anymore and I am going to move onto the next life soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I Am Going To CTB Because I Was Born Female,2632465,mckf,"Aug 15, 2024 at 4:20 AM","I don't mean to belittle your experience and feelings, but I do want to share a male perspective that life isn't exactly so much better.

I think society and this life in general makes it hard for both men and women, not just women or men. Women are physically weaker than men and suffer mentally from their fluctuating hormones. It definitely limits what they are able to do and makes them feel at risk wherever they go. I can see that is why my mother relied on my father to give her good life, unfortunately she had a difficult one.

However most of society adapts to this difference and that's why historically men were the providers of the family and women gave birth and took care of the house and family. But now, the economy is so difficult that one person's income is not enough and requires both the husband and wife to work. In Asian culture, the man is still predominantly seen as the provider and most of the pressure is on him to provide a good quality of life to the family. If he doesn't, the blame goes to the man and he is deemed a failure and he can lose his family as a result. Men can't express their emotions and feelings as they would be seen as weak and as a result, they don't have any close relationships. It is easy to say, just open up, but society doesn't allow for it. That is why men are 3 or 4 times more likely to die by suicide than women.

I lived happily in the delusion that women had the opposite of my issues, because women are valuable and therefore cared for.

I think your suffering is valid, and I'm not here to say otherwise or talk you off the ledge.

While your experience is completely valid, I have to disagree that women as a whole are less than men - less funny, less good at leading, less adventurous - these are all traits that are more individual and there are plenty of men who aren't funny, aren't good at leading and not adventurous and plenty of women who are.

There have been plenty of women scientists and inventors. Ada Lovelace for example wrote an algorithm that would be the first modern computer. She was known for being very intelligent.

It's true that insecure men and women would like to see women fail and as below men. But that's more culturally sanctioned, rather than biological determinism",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't know your circumstances and your experience of life must have formed these strong beliefs you have, which is sad and worrying.

I will say, however, from my own perspective that it is quite shocking to read what you said about women being less than men, inferior in a lot of ways. That thought alone sounds like internalised misogyny. Women can do anything they put their mind to, people can do anything they put their mind to in general. Of course, each person's upbringing, culture and health will impact on that but, generally speaking, there's nothing stopping either a man or a woman from achieving their goals in western society.

Several of the people I admire are women with a lot of success in their life and they're not celebrities or strangers, but people from my own family or relatives of past friends, colleagues, etc. I'm myself a woman, my family was very poor and it was due to my mother's relentless work that we got into a better state of living. My mother was the driving force of everything good that we got in our life. If it would have been for my father, we would still have a very hard life because he never had the courage to try harder, to think outside the box, to work harder.

Gender means very little, it's the kind of person you are and your beliefs that will dictate what you can accomplish. Of course there are situations where it may be harder for one gender to thrive, due to sexism and being in a male dominated field for example, but that's a hurdle on the way that one can surpass. I've dealt with my fair share of sexism due to being a woman in a male dominated field, it was hard but I moved forward, achieved quite a lot of success in my career.

I'm really sorry you have these beliefs and this almost hatred for the female gender, it must be really hard to deal with and I wonder what happened for you to develop these thoughts and limiting beliefs. It's really serious... For me, being a woman is so nice. I'm not the most feminine person by far but I like being what I am. I find it really heart breaking to see how upset you feel by being a woman. I don't know you but I'm sure you're a wonderful person with a lot of capabilities. Like I said, I wonder what happened, how you developed these ideas?

I hope my post doesn't come across as dismissive as I really empathise with your suffering and truly think it is serious, just wanted to give my perspective, shining some light I guess. So sorry that this is such a painful thing for you, I'd be open to chatting with you if you feel like it could be useful for you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I Am Going To CTB Because I Was Born Female,2634573,EvisceratedJester,"Aug 16, 2024 at 2:54 PM","Oh boy.

First off, men might actually be undiagnosed with depression. Men are less likely to seek out help for mental health issues and they are more likely to present symptoms of depression that are typically tested for when diagnosing patients with the disorder. This might be due to certain societal factors (men are expected to not express weakness and are only allowed to express their negative feelings through anger) or due to certain biological differences between men and women. Men also have a lot of mood swings. Just because their mood swings tend to ivolve them switching between one emotion to anger doesn't make them not mood swings all of a sudden. Men are human-beings, not emotionless robots.

Secondly, the patriarchal structures that we still see today didn't start until the agricultural era, at least from what I know. Matritilineal societies do exist, though they are a minority. These societies tend to also not be hierarchical as most patriarchal societies, if I remember correctly.
Also, women did hunt. The whole ""men = hunters and women = gatherers"" thing has been questioned for a long time and recent evidence is starting to actually show that it may have been wrong.
Women have their own physical advantages. For example, women tend to excel in endurance and higher levels of estrogen are associated with better fine-motor control. Hell, you can literally see elderly Mosou women carrying heavy shit around like it's nothing.

To add onto this, women and men aren't even that different in comparison to males and females of other ape species. For example, the size difference between human males and females is actually more similar to that of gibbons (males and females are around the same size) in comparison to other ape species. A meta-synyhesis looking at three decades of research on sex-linked differences in the brain found that our brains are actually monomorphic, not dimorphic. While males and females do differ in some respects (obviously), a good chunk of our differences are due to differences in how we are raised and are expected to behave by others in society.

Thirdly, women have been making contributions to science for a long time. Like, I guess Marie Curie was a man this whole time considering that ""from the stone age to the 1950s, women were prevented from making scientific discoveries"". Women have a long history of making contributions to a variety of different fields, one that is only made even more impressive by the social barriers they would have had to have fought in order to make them.

A lot of your post kind of reeks of bioessentialism, tbh.

(Also, Canada has had a female prime minister before. Her name was Kim Campbell and she came into power after entering the leadership race to succeed Mulroney, who was retiring. She had an approval rating of 51%, making her, at the time, the most popular prime minister in 30 years. She was only prime minister from June 1993 - November 1993, but we still had a female prime minister. She was also the first woman to serve as minister of justice.)",, , ,,,,,,,,,,

I Am Going To CTB Because I Was Born Female,2643682,Heartaches,"Aug 24, 2024 at 3:28 AM","I sympathize with your pain. Society has mistreated and brutalized women for so many centuries. Unfortunately, it is something that is still ever present, and women's rights are being threatened by fascist ideals. No wonder a lot of them feel isolated and deeply hurt, which is something that should be given more attention and support.

However, at the same time, judging by what you wrote, I fear your perspective might be reduced in some regards.

I want to clarify that I'm by no means a historian or expert on the topic and I don't have sources at hand. But the idea of hunter/gatherers, if I recall correctly, is a very western one, especifically a European one. Not all societies in every part of the world followed this scheme, nor every society viewed women as unequal or inherently weaker.

Men are not inherently stronger because of their physical capabilities. Men are not inherently more funny, witty or intelligent. We can't reduce it to hormones or musculature, we have to look at the economic, social, cultural, political and historical aspects as well and how men have been given privilege over others. Men are not superior than women, that's a lie by the patriarchy.

Ignoring or reducing the fight/resistance of women over the centuries is just as harmful. If I could suggest something, I'd recommend reading feminist theory/literature, especially coming from women of color (black, indigenous, arab, asian, etc.), disabled women, queer women, women from underrepresented territories and so forth. They can give you a different perspective from their lived experiences and how they organize and support each other. There are many women around the world taking leading roles and making positive changes for their community. Most of the collectives I've worked with have been mostly comprised and led by women, with great results. Do not underestimate the power you have.

Also, OP, I'd be careful on the sources you've given. We're not really presented with all the details from the studies they used nor do we know the methodology or possible biases involved. Scientific data cannot always be judged by summaries. Independent, critical research is important.

Lastly, don't use Quora as a source, it's the equivalent of Yahoo Answers. Don't take it too seriously since it's just anecdotal evidence.

In fact, when I wrote similar things to what you have written on this forum, I also got a bunch of people pouncing on me to diminish my experiences and observations. Or, people saying, ""I understand that you're choosing to be hurt because of your interpretation of the actually not at all misogynistic world, BUT-"" and then go on some spiel about how obscure feminist literature that nobody in greater society cares about is actually totally relevant and you just need to re-educate yourself. Believe me, I tried that, it didn't work and just made me feel worse in the long run. A lot of it is toxic positivity, and I recently learned that some facts and figures are outright falsified (especially in reference to historical examples of feminism / strong women). People refuse to look at the gruesome reality of how women were historically treated by society and how that still influences all societies today, even if it's not as glaringly obvious in certain parts of the world.

People will say ""no, that's not true at all! We total love women because they're beautiful, kind, submissive, passive, they give me children, they give me free therapy, and having sex with them is great!"" as if that's a compliment. Then, when women look into the actual history of women's (non-existent) rights and speak out about it, they're ignored, called insane / hysterical, or are dismissed for having ""internalized misogyny"" because they noticed the external truth.

I also hate being born female and perceived as female. I know I'm only valued for beauty or reproduction, and the only difference now compared to 50 years ago is that people now just barely attempt to conceal their actual beliefs about women. I've been living with my father for over twenty years, and only now has he recently told me that he thinks only men should be leaders because women aren't suited to be leaders. I assumed he would think better than that since I was his own daughter, but I had not response for him because I just didn't want to try and fight thousands of years of misogyny as one person, so I guess in a way he's right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I suspect too thay maybe in the moment it might be a good way to counterfeit the emotion of what it may feel like to be cared about. Also, given that some people enjoy gore (can't relate, but they exist) given that I was never good for anything in life I might as well be entertaining through death. Also, most of my friend group is long distance, and I've had falling outs with people too, and I don't want to leave people in the dark so idk maybe it's a means to get the news out so that nobody is confused or hurt by the silence/my disappearance (arrogantly assuming I mean much to anyone, but still).

Yes, I know this all sounds very unhinged and maybe narcissistic too.

However there's also logistical problems (eg actually having an audience somehow, recording it etc etc) that discourage me. And then too wtf would it do to my family? That's sad and dark.

I do have the fantasy of being able to say my piece on camera so it's out there and my CTB giving them a reason to watch. Idk something poetic about it in my mind.

Wtf is wrong with me?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

As for whether or not you should give treatment try the antipsychotic(or if ur like me antipsychotic + antidepressant) and after 2-4 weeks where u genuinely feel more in the right state of mind, then evaluate if u still feel like continuing to ctb. Humans have the wonderful awareness that even when we aren't afflicted by significant pressures, our experiences and beliefs can still lead us to believe suicide is the answer. My advice is to just make sure it's you, not just the disorder which is causing your beliefs.

Anyways, aside from the sleepless nights and losing 100s of dollars in a week it's not so bad. Even if u are one of the overly silly people whose mania makes them think they have superpowers!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Help. Just diagnosed as bipolar,2650750,DeathSleep,"Aug 29, 2024 at 9:45 PM","I will share what happened to me and maybe it'll help in some little way. (or maybe not).

I went on the up and down roller coaster that is bipolar for years before I was diagnosed. Once diagnosed I was in denial even though it did make a lot of sense. I was put on a med that I kept going on and off of because I didn't believe I actually needed it. (I also seemed to think that the bipolar was kind of fun sometimes and it seemed like part of my identity or something because I'd always been like that.) Eventually I got so fed up with the bipolar that I gave the med another chance and I stayed on it for years finally realizing that it was in fact helping. That med was lithium. It seemed to help my bipolar but I got sick of the side effects that I put up with for far too long. Eventually I did stop taking it around the time that I took a whole bottle to CTB. (Before I realized how unreliable ODing is.) I was off meds for a few months then put on a different med... abilify. I greatly disliked the extreme restlessness that it caused but I stayed on it because it was keeping my bipolar in check and I didn't know what I should do at the time. The restlessness side effect eventually went away (after quite a while) and I'm still on it today. I'm actually kind of afraid to go off it now because of the side effect of starting it again but also because I know what it's like when I'm not doing anything for my bipolar.

Overall, does the med stop me from being bipolar? No. The swings are just not as extreme. I'm on an antidepressant as well. I don't know if it's because I'm a little older now but it seems exhausting looking back at what it was like and will be like if I stop my med. Sometimes I do miss being manic though. I have found that if I miss a day of taking my med I slip pretty hard into mania the next day. Which isn't as fun as it used to be for me.

That said, has being on a med for bipolar stopped me from wanting to CTB? For me, personally, that's a no. Being on a med may have actually made it a little harder to CTB though. I feel like I'd try more if I was super manic. I didn't feel like it hurt anything by trying meds for bipolar. Maybe it will change how you feel. Maybe it won't.

Sorry this got a little long.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Book Review: Together We Will Go,2626929,daley,"Aug 10, 2024 at 5:09 PM","I have been on a quest to read any book I can find about suicide pacts.
I already posted four reviews here.

The current one is Together We Will Go by J. Michael Straczynski.

Most books about pacts are only about two people, sometimes romantically involved. I have found fewer books with a pact for a group of people.

In this group there is an organizer, Mark, who buys an old bus, hires a driver, and collects
people across the US to finally drive over a cliff near San Francisco.
The people who joined answered a classified ad Mark posted.

There is a server on the bus, and the participants are expected to open an account and
write about why they chose to end their lives, and document anything they would like about themselves. Forming sort of a collective suicide note.

The book is interspersed with these personal writings, email correspondence, and
what happens to them on the road. This provides a lot of variety and insight into
the characters. The story flies by, and I enjoyed it.

The stories of the characters that board the bus cover a lot of ground: Bi-polar disorder, chronic pain, gender-identity, obesity, old age, terminal illness, substance abuse. There is a
nice balance of some people regretting and getting off the bus, and others
following through. The author writes it from a pro-choice perspective,
but it still manages to be a bit too wholesome - there is too much romance, sex,
partying and drugs than I would have imagined. But due to the characters it's still
believable.

In contrast, the only other pro-choice suicide-group-pact book I found was suicide pact by
John Monarch, which I reviewed before. In that book, some of the characters also
continue to look for love, but things backfire miserably. I feel that John Monarch
is an asher himself, and didn't want to relieve the bleak tone of that book.

I haven't found any more suicide pact fiction, especially of more than two people.
Do you know of any?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Book Review: Together We Will Go,2643738,failure383,"Aug 24, 2024 at 4:41 AM","The Manga ""Welcome to the N.H.K"" tells the story about a complete social recluse, who barely leaves his room, is drug-addicted, is severely depressed and as an sub-story/arc gets dragged into a suicide pact with other people as miserable as him. The group met on an online message board and travel to an island with an cliff to kill themselves. During the evening, where the other people pass time with a campfire and drinking, he slowly realizes he wants to kill himself as well. They nearly attempt suicide...but they get saved by perfect timing of the saviors and get rescued. The protog attempts suicide a second time near the end of the story, but doesn't die either. It's a rather silly story with a serious undertone, or a serious story with a silly undertone. It probably depends on your point of view.

I don't think it's really worth reading if you are just interested in the suicide arc, because it's not as focused at this, as it is with the severe social withdrawal of the protag, but I got reminded of that Manga, when I read your post about the first book.",2626929,,,,,,,,,,,,

Book Review: Together We Will Go,2647399,failure383,"Aug 27, 2024 at 8:53 AM","You're welcome.
The original novel is exclusively about the protagonists life as a social recluse and a girl, who on surface pretends like he wants to help him out of his miserable situation, but then has her own set of problems, trauma and so on. For better or for worse, all those side arcs, were added only in the manga (beside the suicide pact arc, there was an pyramid scheme scam arc and video game addiction arc).

I think the suicide pact arc, begins in chapter 7 or 8, which should be both volume 2.",2646397,,,,,,,,,,,,
Book Review: Together We Will Go,2651517,daley,"Aug 30, 2024 at 11:22 AM","I read the first two volumes of the manga. It's a bit different than you described. It's extremely quirky.
The English translation has some issues, so I am not sure I understood everything correctly.
Anyway, here is how I understood the plot.

The protagonist Satou, meets a girl who was his senior at high-school. She has her own problems.
She convinces him to go on vacation with her. He doesn't even know that there are supposed to be
other people along with them, and definitely doesn't know about it being a suicide pact.

At the train station they meet three other people who join them on the vacation. They arrive
at a private island owned by one the participants. Satou tries to have fun, but the others
are moody and uncooperative.

They gather in a tent with a grill in order to CTB by Carbon Monoxide. Satou is
finally informed that this is a suicide pact. Each of the three people talk about their
reasons to suicide, but one by one they regret it. The girl Satou came with gets
a phone call that she is getting married, so she becomes very happy.

Satou is depressed that he lost the girl, and he decides to CTB. They all exit the
tent leaving him the only one inside, but when he loses consciousness they take him
out and leave the island with him.

I have never read a manga before. I guess that for a manga, this is a very serious
story, but it is still told in a very quirky, over the top, manner. I cannot even decide
whether this is pro-choice or not. The discussion between the participants includes
a lot of pro-choice arguments, but at the end, nobody exits, implying that they did
not think things through.",2647399,,,,,,,,,,,,

CantdoIt's Thread for general venting,2641006,CantDoIt,"Aug 21, 2024 at 4:59 PM","I feel like a lot of people here have real reasons to ctb and mine is just abysmal. I had a pretty good childhood and my parents gave me a lot of time and effort.

They could be a little strict sometimes. Particularly my father, with grades, and I did get in relative trouble for getting anything below a C in class. However, I wasted most of my youth being depressed in an angry way. I was never satisfied, and there was always something bothering my since the age of 15.

Somehow I was both the bully and the one being made fun of. Picked on in middle school but not nice either. Signs put on my back for being too nerdy or just being pointed and laughed at by groups of other kids.
I could be mean to my friends due to my own discontentment and insecurities, and most people really did grow out of this type of behavior around high school. I challenged myself by running cross country in high school even though I didn't like it. I wasted 4 perfectly good years I could have spent studying and having friends and bonding doing running for hours after school in the blazing heat. Sometimes I almost threw up.

My parents were conservative and my dad, who was loving towards me, often made very rude remarks about other people which I took to heart instead of just believing my friends who were obviously right about these topics. My dad was fatphobic and I became anorexic, either due to him or because at the time there was a lot of fatphobic messaging on TV.

I spent my college years being stupidly depressed due to BDD and my ex breaking up with me, instead of studying and enjoying those years, and then started aging very rapidly around age 21 after drinking 2 energy drinks a day and letting my weight get down to a 15 bmi along with a junk food diet and being sad

I was placed outpatient at an eating disorder clinic where I gained weight and was medicated but my skin never really bounced back after that. I spent a long time just doing nothing, working from home, etc.

I discovered I was queer later but it didn't really matter. I finally I understood the correct way of thinking, but I had to be told. I started off as kind of a weird and angry child and I don't know why either. I remember being angry that someone stole my spot in preschool, that someone ate my goldfish crackers, that someone beat me at a video game. I hated people being better than me and almost everyone was better than me.

I spent too long pretending I was better than other people when I wasn't and I wasted my life and my youth and what were supposed to be good times being pissed off about insanely stupid things that didn't matter.

I grew out of it too late. I try to spread positivity now but I can't look past what I ruined for myself. I look old before my time and my skin is a wreck and I don't have a career. You have to be trying to look as bad as me. People here are so incredibly kind and gentle and I admire them all so much and feel badly that they were abused or hurt and that something like that is driving them to ctb. You are the ones I wished I had listened to before it was too late.

I was always trying to be tough because I knew people saw me as weak. It made me feel bad, I wanted to be as good as everyone else but the way to be good was by putting the effort in...not by trying to be tough. I am not tough.

I have been trying to be better for around 10 years now and when I began feeling suicidal was the moment I realized that I truly wanted to understand the meaning of life which is to give and receive love. Most people are born with that knowledge. I unveiled my lesson when I learned that purpose and I am living my remaining days slow to anger and very very emotional and hopefully understanding.

I failed something very fundamental and human. Other people were volunteering in high school and preparing for their futures while I was stuck being an eternal child for no reason. I feel like below garbage. A worm that couldn't pass an essential test. There are worse people than me who didn't ruin their life like this.

My parents would still do anything for me and I have a loving partner but what I gave up is just too much. I failed too hard. My behavior too abnormal and twisted and repulsive. Most people at least care about the way they look and don't ruin it the second they become a young adult. Most people are mature by college. I hit every correct button to make myself truly, utterly, miserable. I had almost reached my childhood dream when I had the breakdown but I truly don't even care about that anymore either.

The other day a client told me he had cancer and was learning self care and positivity and that I should concentrate on myself when I couldn't complete a project for him out of depression. He offered to chat. The beauty of humanity is that there are so many good people out there who just want the best for everyone out of instinct.

I feel I was broken from the start. Some of my first memories are of being mean or angry. I don't even understand why, my parents aren't like that. They don't anger easily. I wish I had been normal, was it because my mom fell while pregnant with me? Was it because I fell out the window of my house as a toddler and got a huge bump on my head? I was only ever hit once or twice. I don't believe in hitting but maybe I should have been hit more. Maybe I should have been the exception.

And of course my last impulse is to ctb and leave people behind who care about me, I literally just do not feel like a human. I do not fathom how a human can fall and fail as hard as me. Literally nothing that a normal human does, even in self preservation, did I do. When I say ""why me"", I am really asking why I couldn't do a single thing correctly.

So of course my ego is important to me and my childhood memories are meaningful. Someone like that, who had been so useless, cornering themselves into ctb and who clearly deserves to do so, of course cares deeply and passionately about my own life or bullshit memories.

I couldn't save myself when everyone else did and I'm done. Im tired of being haunted, flashing memories and images, constantly trying to pull back decisions that I made ages ago. As a kid I truly never imagined how dismal and pathetic I would be and am deeply sorry for it to myself and everyone else I was a nuisance to.

Hey guys I feel the need to put this out there. I don't really know what to live for anymore. I used to be able to bully myself away from suicide by calling it weak willed and the easy way and extremely selfish. That doesn't work anymore.

I know my family would bend over backwards to stop me so i don't tell them anything. They don't really matter to me in that sense. I guess I really was closest my father but since he's cut off us I don't really know. I have a girl in my life but i don't think there's anything of substance there. I'm really afraid though so I just really can't make a permanent decision.

So I made a promise to myself. One way or another I'm gonna do something about my life. I get 1 year to decide on between living or catching. During this I'll make every effort to improve myself. I'm working out, I got a job, trying in school and I'm eating better. If I feel the same then that's that and goodbye to all. If I stuck to this and anything is better then I'll wait another year.

I've already decided on a spot if I break my promise. Funnily enough it's where my dad used to take me fishing so it's sort of a fuck you to him. I think I'll write the note eventually but I feel like I should write individual ones for each of my family members. - JUP",,,,,,,,,,,,,

the sex industry,2626127,nembutal,"Aug 9, 2024 at 9:28 PM","does anyone else work in the sex industry ? (onlyfns, escorting, etc) i'd like to connect with other sex workers and share experiences. this work isn't easy in the slightest and id like to hear how others deal with it under daily suicidal intent.

a couple of months ago i landed a restaurant job after 3 months of searching and hundreds of submitted resumes. i was very flimsy and by the first hour i felt crippled. i don't know why but i cant seem to function normally in regular work, and for $17/h at that.

i'd already had my first escort experience by then, i made $400 seeing a man for an hour. while i was wiping tables and forcing smiles at white conservatives i couldn't think about anything other than the $400 i had made simply dissociating and letting someone use me for an hour. so three hours in i fired myself and i haven't had a regular job since.

with my level of demand i can make around 3k a month seeing 2-3 people a week. i am on a break right now as im wrapped up in heroin addiction but im unsure of whether i should go back. i take the right precautions to ensure i dont meet any creeps but i still wouldn't want to go out by the hands of a prostitute killer. thankfully i haven't had a bad encounter yet. as soon as im recovered i will most likely go back to escorting as i see no form of education or long term career in my future. and sex will always be in demand.

i don't view myself as lucky to find myself in this position. for one, if i were to be found out by family i would be immediately shunned. with the way economy is shaped today and the fact that i have one year of flunked education under my belt and a huge chunk missing from my resume due to rehab i don't see any other solution to gathering income. that and the fact that mainstream work feels like nails on a chalkboard, like the worst crushing pain being reminded every second on the clock that you are nothing but a cog for shareholders and fat cats.

the job itself isn't easy on its own either. lots of stress during the vetting process wondering if this is the guy who will turn you into a mangled corpse, tons of marketing and stressful decisions involved, and of course faking pleasure and affection during the hour i am around the guest. i feel miserable either way, but id rather feel miserable with 400 dollars in my pocket.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Here in the UK, I actually played a blinder because I 'pre-primed' the doctor with years of history on the medical record. Behaviours etc… So when I finally asked for a sick note to take to the Department of Work and Pensions, they fired it out of a cannon at me. In fact, the DWP needs three sick notes before they can put you on sickness benefits. Then I had to fight them for two years to get the slighter higher rate they should have been giving me from the beginning. I met so many people, including ex-armed forces, who have to fight their way up like this through the benefits system. Having moaned about it here, it's definitely worth trying, because it does make life a little easier when you get there.

On the next point, there is an established economic model behind the idea that we, the individuals are the problem. They cannot admit that they have created this place, that does this to people. They can never, ever, admit that the fierce economic system they have created forces us to make these kinds of choices. They ignore us, because we threaten the idea that everything in their glorious system is hunky dory. Suicide they say, is the fault of the suicidal, nothing to do with the fact that income inequality is sharper now then at any point in human history. Drug abuse is the fault of the addicted, they say, nothing to do with the fact that nearly fifty years of failed drugs policy in the western world has created a multi-billion dollar illicit drugs industry. To them, any threat to their way of life in this system is to be ignore or pilloried. Why? Because if the system collapses, they go with it. If the system is replaced with something fairer, more egalitarian, they lose their positions. Protect the system, blame the individual.

Even in your reply, I can tell. You think about it. Come over to the dark side, with us writers. Us ideaists, a word I just made up to describe people like us. People who want to display our minds on the page. Let the words take you away… On a more serious note, even if you do a page per day, or fill in a journal, jot some thoughts down, just to keep the creative juices flowing, as it were. Your experience in life will absolutely colour the writing you produce and that's a good thing. George Orwell wrote a fantastic book called 'Down and Out in Paris and London.' In it, he describes being a waiter in Paris and later, being homeless in London before the war. He did these things on purpose. He wanted to live these lives so he could learn what it was like to live on the bottom. On the edge of society. This he reasoned, would make him a much better writer.

One of the possible explanations for this is maslows hierachy, which shows that regardless of status you have needs, and additionally the needs are more psychologically based as opposed to the physiologically based. Kinda the idea that it's harder to be sad when your starving, since your more focused on the starvation than the sadness. Also if you practice SH you might realize this since your less focused on your internal suffering and the more acute physical pain.

Finally for the noncontroversial statement, we are all different and posses different tolerances. How much you can take vs how much another can take. Its okay to be sad if your tolerance isn't as high, no need to feel shame about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Have it way better than other people but still want to ctb,2650580,Holu,"Aug 29, 2024 at 6:53 PM","Ya this connection definitely is valid, but another reason for why those story's feature poor and abused is simply based on the underdog fallacy, which is essentially the tendency to support the underdog regardless of prior affinity to said person. Authors, knowingly or unknowingly will lean into this. Not to mention the population who wants to read rich man hero is far less. Even Batman needs some tragedy for nuance and support, or else the reader struggles to find a connection to the character.


As for this portion, you are 100% correct. I'll go a little further into the theory of maslows hierarchy of needs. Below is a diagram.
Essentially, as the individual moves up the triangle (starting from the base physiological needs) your focuses are on the next layer, continuing to self actualization. Self actualization essentially requires your real self to be your ideal self, and as a result is incredibly difficult, and I'd argue impossible(without completely lowering your standards which I believe we can't truly do). The hierarchy is kinda a tragic demonstration that no matter what we will never be fufulled. Something which supports this is the hedonic treadmill theory, which is the idea that we have a set, stable level of happiness, and no matter what we will return to this state after time. As such, increase of money, romance, etc while it can make slight changes, ultimately whatever initial highs we get from this will return to base. The exception is self actualization, and if you subscribe to these theories, then I'll provide a bit more support, as researchers have actually found an interesting loophole to the hedonic treadmill, plastic surgery. Essentially, studies have found successful plastic surgery genuinely increases long term happiness, and in terms of self actualization, it's because you look more like your ideal self. This same logic applies to working out, getting tattoos, and clothing. We are social creatures, and how others perceive us has value.

Anyways I'll stop rambling lmao. Hope this helps tho.

Have it way better than other people but still want to ctb,2650594,CantDoIt,"Aug 29, 2024 at 7:09 PM","No worries! Actually one of my main complaints is about my looks. I have body dysmorphic disorder but also, basically, a severe history of abusing myself and my body such that I've had premature ageing since a very early age. Now I feel like I can't go outside, look at people, enjoy my hobbies, etc.

This is the same with everyone who has BDD regardless of what the BDD is about. While medicine and therapy has helped in the past, I don't expect it to help my anymore. Also, while successful plastic surgery would help me, those with BDD are not recommended to get it and in addition to that I don't believe that plastic surgery would be successful with me.

You would think that someone with so many issues with the self would have taken care of my body before it was too late, but of course no, because I had other episodes of severe depression or anxiety in which 'letting myself physically deteriorate' was part of the symptoms.

So now I simply fantasize about what it would be like to be a happy healthy member of society who actually looks their age or younger like most of the population, so I could actually come to that position eventually.

Also, because I'm trans, this was part of the reason that as a kid and teen I abused my body and because I never learned proper emotional regulation before it was too late, I don't have any chance now. So I already had this heightened sense of body image issues due to being trans and just exacerbated it to the extreme. If I had been cis I likely would have taken care of myself and made sure my appearance was to my standards because I would have loved myself a little more.

And now I look like garbage anyway so FML. I know I could have taken care of myself well if I had thought about it for two seconds but of course not.",2650580,,,,,,,,,,,,

Have it way better than other people but still want to ctb,2650614,Holu,"Aug 29, 2024 at 7:28 PM","Ah, bdd and gd. The nightmare combo. I've had a good amount of trans friends, so much so they have almost all jokingly called me an egg(but no I'm cis, never had a trans experience besides love for my blahaj). Two of my closest trans friends(one passed) just have gd, but one had both bdd and gd(also passed) and she would argue a lot with the other two about things like her shoulders and what could have been. Having both is beyond incomprehensible in suffering, and so even if you feel like you have it better, it's probably irrelevant given the constant distress you undergo. I'm beyond sorry, I truly wish we understood more about trans individuals. As a result of my experiences, I'm in the small population of cis people who agrees with pre-puberty HRT, but understand the caution do to lack of knowledge to confirm. Something fascinating is that trans people's brain structures actually resemble their gender identity more than their sex identity. I hope some day we understand to the fullest to allow trans youth to have the best possible experience.

As for the what ifs, my advice is to do what you can to quell those thoughts. To some degree we all wish we did things differently, but at the same time our perspectives and the people we are have been made from our decisions. Call it pride, but I like to think that in a horrible way, it's better I developed stronger self-awareness to realize the inescapable suffering that is sentience. Maybe it's better to die and reach peace sooner, than it is to suffer in potential ignorance. Then again, perhaps it is I who is ignorant. Regardless, I am the person I am.

Anyways hope you're doing okay today, make sure to take care of yourself even if u are hard on yourself. Self peace and kindness are important, especially in a constant veil of suffering.
Yes our emotional pain thresholds vary greatly. There is no shame in this, in the same way some people can take 20 bullets and some die from 9mm leg shots. Everyone is different and there's only so much you can do to strengthen your base threshold.",2650594,2650613,,,,,,,,,,,
Have it way better than other people but still want to ctb,2650637,CantDoIt,"Aug 29, 2024 at 7:50 PM","Thanks a lot for your support. I am so sorry about your friends. It's truly a nightmare combination that I don't wish on my worst enemy. I can't believe I was ""lucky"" enough to have both. There are so many people I could have been that wasn't a person who felt both of these things.

I also believe in pre-puberty transition, but when I first started getting these feelings I had the sense that my parents would not approve and so I said nothing. I just fantasized a lot and didn't admit it to my therapist either because I was embarrassed.

Years later, they came to accept it, but there was turbulence in between during a period when my Dad most definitely did not accept it. They are kinder about it now but my brain attacks me daily.

The brain thing might also explain why I acted out so much as a child. I was distinctly...angrier, or less satisfied, or something. It was very difficult to make me happy on a long term basis.

While I do realize it's best to let go of past mistakes, it's just so much for me to deal with. My hobbies and everything I enjoy are tainted with my comparisons to others and flashbacks of my precious decisions. And I'm not getting any better looking at this point! It's all downhill from here. I barely even let people take pictures of me when I had a youthful appearance, but at least I wasn't deathly afraid of it already by the age of 22. (I kid you not, that is how badly I failed anti-aging. My parents never experienced anything remotely like this) The transition stuff is just the icing on the cake I guess, I transitioned but I'm ugly. My parents care for me and I hate to make them sad but I literally am repulsed by my appearance and personality to the point where I wish I was stuck with almost anyone else besides myself.

Thank you so much for your kind words. I am trying to do all the basics for myself and it's hard to do that when you feel your future ended when it's just starting for others. It makes me feel like I don't belong here in this society at all.",2650614,,,,,,,,,,,,
Have it way better than other people but still want to ctb,2650652,Holu,"Aug 29, 2024 at 7:59 PM","Ya, it's a bad combo, and oddly less common than I'd expect amongst trans people. It's one thing to not belong, it's a whole different story when you don't belong with the people who don't belong.

My friend with both felt the same as you, even though she was more beautiful than I think she thought of herself, it would never be enough. I hope that in the future we can determine things like being trans early as possible, as transitioning pre puberty is night and day.

As for your day to day I understand, and I hear you wholeheartedly about the whole familial experience. Heck, I relate to the therapist thing, I've been in and out of therapy since I was 6 and have essentially lied the whole time. The small exceptions I spoke truthfully always resulted in negative consequences which reinforced my desire to just not speak my actual mind. Even at the start when I did, it felt pointless, and by the time I was an adult in IOP and tried to be 100% truthful I fear I'm far to nihilistic to ever be healed by therapy.

Do what you can to soothe yourself. You're still human, and even if most people dont care about humans most people on this forum do. I hope all goes well, be it continuing or ultimately ctbing. Nothing but love and well wishes.",2650637,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd say I have or have had: limerance, a crushing lack of self confidence, (mild-moderate) social anxiety, a compulsion to either over eat or follow a ridiculously strict diet- so- likely borderline eating disorders and likely mild-moderate depression most of my life.

It's strange because life now isn't anywhere near as bad as it was back then. I really felt in utter despair and desperation at some points. I can't exactly say my motives to want to CTB are the same as back then. Still- all that stuff makes us who we are I suppose. It can severly limit us in life if we aren't willing to do what it takes to heal- if we even can heal that is- rather than keep slapping bandaids over it. Plus- you don't even know how to heal when you are a kid. You are at the mercy of other people noticing and doing something about it. I'm not so sure people with the REALLY bad childhoods can even heal. I just feel horrified by some of the stories here. Mine hasn't been as bad- but it felt dreadful at the time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

They threatened to send me to my mom's cousin who was a foster parent. When I said that's what I wanted they told me I would be sodomized everyday so they could get the big win of scaring me by the at risk youth she takes in.

The scary part is, I'm not even actively depressed right now - just life anxiety. I'm so tired of fighting through life. Trying. Everything is a battle for me. Seeking therapy. Working on myself. My soul fibers are just exhausted.. I feel like I've lived 100 years and I'm not even 40. 30 years now I've contemplated ending my life on and off, but always dug down and gritted my teeth and got through it …only to wind up in the exact same mental place over and over and over. Does anyone else feel that no matter what they do, no matter what therapy they have, what self help books they read.. nothing works? I feel like everywhere I go, I'm eventually rejected. Misjudged. Misunderstood. I'm funny. I'm intelligent. I'm empathetic. I make people laugh. I'm soulful. Good at my career. Intellectual. A high achiever. Yet… rejected from society because I'm just not similar enough to everyone else. I don't follow trends. I don't do social media. Is that threatening to other people? I'm tired of living. Haunted by my past. Haunted by my family. Feeling like my life was cursed from the start. Everything or everyone I've ever loved has either died or abandoned me abruptly. I'm just heartbroken.

Over a year ago I bought what I thought would be the gun I eventually ctb with. A .38 special with hollow points. This year I decided to buy a .44 S&W with hollow points bc I don't have an option for this to not work and got nervous after reading here that my first gun was probably insufficient. It has to work. I have no family that gives a shit about me to care for me if I vegetable myself.

So here I am. Anticipating a possible job layoff soon due to the economy being not good in my industry. Not even depressed right now, but contemplating ending it all simply because I'm too tired to navigate one more challenging life shit surprise. As an ACE score of 8 this seems like a likely outcome for me anyways. I don't deserve this. I love myself enough to give myself relief, if I do it it will be the bravest thing I've ever done.

I'm in my mid 50s, which I am guessing might sound like I'm a dinosaur to some folks on here :) Needless to say, I feel like I'm in my mid 80s and I'm at the 2 minute warning of the 4th quarter, to use an American football reference. But even before that happened, I always felt way older than I was and that my time on this planet was going to be over soon.

I have never fit in society either and it bothered me for years. I hated myself so damn much for not ""getting it"" and not being able to jump on whatever trend was happening. I tried fixing my hair and wearing the same clothes, but felt fake (that's one tiny example of trying to fit in) and I hated being fake. I don't do social media, either, and I actually think you're smart for not doing it. Most of it is mindless dribble and it sounds like you're way beyond wanting that.

I finally, a year or so ago, decided fuck it, since I am getting ready to die, I'm going to be myself. I don't give half a rat's ass who does not like how I live, how I look, what my values are, what I believe or don't believe, what I do for a living, how damn poor I am, or any damn thing else. This is my life and for the last few years I'm on this stinking planet, I refuse to be anyone other than me. It's a damn shame that I was on this planet over a half a century before I decided to try being me. Wish it would have been in my 20s. I sure would have been happier. But, I'm happy I tried now.

I am sorry to hear about your situation and I understand the absolute exhaustion.

I completely empathise with your situation. It is my own. I am not the least depressed right now, even though I have struggled with it greatly in my life. And yet now is the time for me to CTB. Which makes me think it's coming from a rational place, rather than reactiveness to a random set of circumstances. I am violently opposed to the people who post on here trying to save people - it's against the basic rules of the site & pushing god onto anyone gets my goat. Your god means something to you, not to everyone. So, even though I one hundred per cent mirror your situation, I'll give you one reason for & one reason against & leave it up to you - it's your decision. Obviously.
One on the Just. Do. It side of the argument is that the what doesn't kill us theory has been totally disproved - we grow less & less resilient over time - our 13th reason why, our straw that broke the camel's back. It's real.
On the other side, conventional therapies (& I mean meds & nearly all therapies, especially traditional talk-based therapies) don't tackle trauma head on. Trauma needs a different approach than depression or other things. So if you haven't tried a therapy that tackles trauma, maybe have a go at that first??? Like biofeedback or neurofeedback or kinesiology? Trauma needs a therapy that bypasses the rational / logical / thinking brain & talks to your gut / past / trauma / inner child. If god is your thing go for it, I just can't handle it personally. If anything was to save me, it would be the therapies mentioned above - I've received radical change quickly - mind blowing & life changing for me - not something I've achieved after trying every other thing in the universe - Traditional Chinese Herbal teas & acupuncture through to every antidepressant known to man - I feel like I ""could've"" maybe achieved success & been ""healed"" enough to live a proper life if my physical health hadn't deteriorated to the point of no return. But it has. My body broke before my mind & that's legitimately not something I anticipated. Almost funny, but not quite. Maybe look into how the body stores trauma & how to release it??? I wish you luck. But as someone who always provides the loudest laugh in any room, every day, all the time, on switch never off, no matter how broken inside, I know how goddamn exhausting that is & wouldn't judge you for a second if you swung the other way. It's about making informed choices that are right for you. If you can be saved, be saved. If help will help, get help. If you've made a decision that won't be unmade, people should respect that. And if not here, then where????? Best of luck, whatever that may look like to you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It always has been. Even as a little girl. I used to hate it. The attention, the presents, the family coming together to threw you a nice birthday party to ""celebrate"" another year in this miserable life

The older I get, the more hate and disgust I have towards this so called celebration. I absolutely despise it

Personally, I don't want to celebrate it, I just want to sleep all day long, forget about it, act as if nothing happens. Yet, I know, like every other year, family are gonna call, everyone is gonna be joyful over the phone, while I'm on the other side of the phone feeling like I'm gonna throw up. What is there to celebrate ? Depression, anxiety, illnesses, a fucked up life ?

I know how I'm gonna pass my birthday this year. Coping in the worst way possible, since I can't CTB yet. I'm gonna get wasted, take a little bit too much meds, and, be real high from it for once

Several years I ""celebrated"" my birthday alone. Now I have my boyfriend but it still feels so sad, so empty...

Is death a relief?,2648319,Forever Sleep,"Aug 28, 2024 at 2:19 AM","The idea of death can be a relief while we're still alive. If death didn't exist. If we all lived forever, we'd know there was no end to the pain. Still, if that's all there ever was, I suppose we wouldn't think to question it. But yeah- passive ideation can be a comforting thought.

The actual thing though. Who knows? Personally, I doubt we'll feel anything after death. But, if there are afterlives then- it's going to depend if we go somewhere better or worse I imagine and how conscious we still are.

We can't entirely predict how we'll be feeling right before death too. Probably depends on how we die. Sadly, I think a lot of suicide methods involve large elements of fear, discomfort and pain. May as well 'enjoy' the idea of being relieved by death while we're still alive I suppose.

I remember a more pro-life member once making a kind of bizarre argument like that once. Like- if you get any enjoyment out of life- even if that enjoyment comes from thinking about your own death/ non existence- you still need to remain alive in order to be able to experience that. Of course, it seems kind of ridiculous to me because, hand in hand with that idealised idea of death is the knowedge that it's going to be incredibly risky and very possibly painful and terrifying to actually accomplish. It's actually a horrible longing rather than some pleasant day dream when it comes down to it- active ideation for a lot of us. It would be nice to think that after all that, we would actually be 'rewarded' with a calm, peaceful transition but, I doubt it for many of us.

Really, even in an ideal scenario- assisted suicide in a clinic. 100% guaranteed death and hopefully, relatively painless. Would it still be an entirely calm process? None of us know what death actually is. We may have someone we care about with us who we're having to say goodbye to. We may well be feeling bad for them. Plus, we're about to drink a poison. I imagine it's a lot like going in for an operation. You hope it will work but, you're full of uncertainty. I'm not even sure natural death is always calm either.

For us in this forum the possibility to end ones life premature is a relief, provided that we believe things will become better when we are dead. If death means not existing anymore this should be true but we cannot be completly sure, that death means the transition into not existence.

Basically we can only be sure that our mind exists, the knowledge of anything outside of our own mind is unsure, the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside our mind. Who ever dreamt to dream will understand this, death could only mean the transition to another dream.

Many people who would acknowledge my ""privilege"" were over 30 so i guess i understand their perspective but this isn't a blessing to me. i feel like i'll be trapped in this endless cycle of wanting to change and do better until i decide to CTB. yes, i learned a lot in treatment and from the people i experienced being with but idk i feel guilty for feeling like this was a curse. i'm sure if i was seeking treatment any older than i did i would've still felt like shit but it's unfortunate that i recognized A LOT as a really young person.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am now scared my  will not work.,2574116,nottinghams,"Jun 25, 2024 at 10:06 AM","Hello. My method is very simple.

I have real fentanyl in powder form, tested to be sure. I bought it from the dark web black market. I have no tolerance to opiates and have never taken one. I am going to take some DMSO, which is a chemical that causes faster absorption, through the mouth and then overdose on the powder with some water orally.
This is enough so that orally is a painless method that works. besides, even regular heroin users find that crap way too easy to die on. I'm not nervous.

Well I wasn't until I got sick.
I'll spare details, just I got sick last november with unexplained fevers and now in the last 2 months it has gotten steadily worse. cardiac, pulmonary, maybe kidney things, some neurological (there was a whole weak I could barely walk)
This causes awful awful awful pain, and it also annoyingly exacerbates SI (and causes emotions that hurt, like a neuro [problem) For some reason, a diagnosis with blood work has not yet been reached.
I am to see an immunologist friday there for low-to-almost-nothing levels of immunoglobulin A, G, E, if any of you knows what that means.

But what I mean its actually so bad I can't CTB. So in the meantime (doctors don't want to prescribe without knowing) I bought some weed vapes and nicotine. I havent used in years.
I use both, I use different strains, I use them together. I have to overdose to feel anything and its maybe? some energetic/sleepy calm and then I just fall asleep. one strain of weed occasionally makes it WORSE. the nicotine vape is o-k at the pain relief (like the smoking weed) but not amazing.
I'm annoyed at this so I buy kratom, say that's it. Kratom is an opiate-like (but is not an opiate) plant like drug, supposed to work for pain somewhat like an opioid does (without me worrying about tolerance for my Method lol)
I take 1 pill, which is the maximum dose..nothing. I feel absolutely nothing. no worsening, no relief...
this is terrifying and im suffering a lot all the time, I just want to go to sleep (it was later that night) so I take an as need hydroxozine pill I asked my psychiatrist to prescribe for this months ago (before I discovered and has my Method) this normally almost always works if I just want to make the pain less acute.
it barely worked that night either. Holy shit. I'm beginning to realize some rare diseases, especially kidney and liver issues which I suspect, can screw up your metabolism and make some drugs and chemicals not work.

I think if pain relief doesn't work, I can still try to force myself to CTB (because truthfully, without illness, I am totally unafraid of death) and I haven't tried alcohol in awhile, so...

But now I'm on the verge of tears, terrified for some reason that this means my fentanyl CTB will not work. I do not even know the reason for certain. and I do not want to severely botch it, and I really really do not want to hunt for another painless method.

Please please please tell me my fears are unwarranted. Please tell me I'm being silly, and I can just CTB like I was gonna. I can't do this. Please.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had some periods using Kratom and I would have to take at least 6 - 8 capsules (about 3 - 4 grams of Kratom powder) for it to work. When I was first switching to it, I would have to take even more than that. If you have more kratom, I would try taking a larger dose because a single pill wont do anything (even if you have no tolerance, its not enough.)

Ok so you got actual pure fent crystals... I wish I had known that when we were talking before, because the whole time I was thinking it was from a street dealer. It gets confusing because people will use the word ""Fentanyl"" to refer to the pure crystals (very potent) as well as the white-powder street product (heavily diluted to widely varying degrees, not pure.) Often the street stuff comes as a solid white brick, sometimes marketed as ""china white"" (even though real china white is actual heroin.. more confusion). Before it reaches the user, it is further diluted and mixed with more cut, as dealers try to increase the weight of the product by adding inactive ingredients. This could happen multiple times depending on how many middlemen it changes hands through.

If the darkweb stuff you got is indeed pure, then I would have much more confidence in it, as opposed to something purchased from a local dealer. If you dont mind me asking, was it relatively straightforward for you to find it? And how long did you have to wait for the shipment? Maybe I should reconsider the darkweb after all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am 5'9 and 210 pounds give or take. I am of course interested in partial suspension since that seems better considering my weight issue. How will one in my weight range go about successfully hanging themselves, preferably through partial suspension if they most likely have no access to structures that will hold that amount of weight without fail? By that I mean I have no beams, doors, etc to hang myself from. My doors will definitely not hold my weight. I have wooden bannisters but I'm not entirely sure if they can hold my weight.

I was particularly interested in Kate Spade's or Robin William's methods to CTB but I'm sure they were nowhere near my weight range.

My last two+ years have been hell. The problems started slowly, and while I have no doubt that my supposed mental health ""providers"" meant well, they only caused my problems to snowball, and along the way, they actively drove me from baseline suicidal ideation (i.e. it was as low as it had ever been in the previous 5 decades) to actively suicidal - and every last bit of it was easily avoidable it they had actually heard what I told them.

I started writing up a summary (it turned into much more) less than 48 hours after the linchpin incident and posted it roughly 64 weeks after the linchpin incident.

Initially, I had only planned to address events and actions that led up to that specific incident, and I was writing it specifically for Veterans Administration (VA) mental health providers and leadership.

In discussing what happened to me with other people over the following months, it quickly became clear that this type of document could be relevant to a range of mental health providers, researchers, and leadership outside of the VA.

Fate also had another series of events in store for me, and these additional events provide a great juxtaposition and useful insights in their own right.

My case provides an amazing counter-point between the way non-mental health providers and mental health providers handled two different conditions, both of which were seen by them, at some point, as purely somatic, despite both conditions ultimately having very real, very medically treatable physiological aspects.

Okay, but that's not the argument here. I didn't say humans need this theory to explain that. I'm sure homosapiens were capable of much.
Which physics is that? I've not found anything of the sort. In fact, the fermi paradox exists because there should be abundant civilization observable to us, but there isn't. Also your video only gives reasons why we would suppose communication hasn't occurred between us and ET life.
Extinction events are very circumstantial and dare I say random.

Plenty of time for an advanced civilization to evolve. So please explain more on these supposed limiters that are giving you that probability.

But how, I doubt that's controversial. Everyone agrees autism is not a great thing to be burdened with. It almost sounds you're implying something can be done, but people are avoiding do that thing.



Fair enough



Does that mean you believe philosophical materialism? Honestly, I can understand why someone would believe as you do. I have an open view, I've seen a compelling case for both there being no afterlife and there being one.

whatever alien civilizations are out there, theyre literally too far away. ""light years"" is not a joke or anything to underestimate. we cant just work around it nor the speed of light being the speed limit of existing. where were we millions of years ago? nowhere. we only see things millions and billions of years in the past because its that far away. by light. the ""by time"" comparison is mind numbing. the expansion of spacetime exiles us from other galaxies, but even within our own, we cant even reach the closest star and how many years have we been looking nearby? barely any and its still shockingly far away despite being relatively ""close"" for space. it is unfathomably vast, even nearby. we hardly see anything of the known universe, given how large its expected to be due to cosmic inflation. life is complicated and messy and far more likely to not advance to anything beyond bacteria; there are (potentially, according to microbiologists) up to 2 trillion species on earth and almost all of them are tiny, simple, single celled or very small muti-celled organisms with 0 intelligence to speak of. evolution does not favor intelligence if the spectrum of a species success involves ""existing prolifically"". it takes absurdly more resources to develop neurons, brains and larger bodies that can adapt to more than just ""devour fuel and multiply dna"" by the simplest means possible. it took billions of years for that to happen on earth. planets get wiped out routinely, not much in the universe actually remains stable long enough for anything resembling civilization to form. what little life may remain after the gauntlets of radiation, heat, cold and other small life consuming it are just too far away and not developed further.

as for the warp drive and wormhole stuff, if a physicist or engineer ever figures out how to overcome something plank length sized, ""exotic matter"" or contend with the gravity of a black hole and survive it (which is what all these ideas seem to rely on), congrats to them they've won every nobel prize ever lol. substances that cannot exist in the universe and forces matter cannot endure. its literally impossible for humans or anything, really, to physically overcome. it isnt plausible. mathematics also doesnt forbid the statistical possibility of spontaneously popping out of existence here on earth and reappearing at some random point in spacetime. michio kaku (a fucking crackpot but hes not bad at math) required his grad students to find the correct statistics on exactly that to graduate his theoretical physics class at one point. math saying its possible doesnt automatically make it physically possible for us. its not and i wish certain public speakers would stop these doublespeak psych out propositions like it is just for money and clicks. very long and im sorry for the rant but i study physics and this is a point of contention for me if you cant tell lol",2589050,,,,,,,,,,,,

I mentioned once on here that though psilocybin has shown promise in trials with minimal to no side effects for the treatment of depression, it continues to be heavily regulated and controversial in the scientific community.

Quickest way to go in case of surviving nuclear war,2644131,spanisiva87,"Aug 24, 2024 at 2:13 PM","Hey,

WW3 is around corner and i am terrorized the way i go... This world is sadistic hell as we know and it is extremely difficult to kill human body!!!

As for paracetamol, I don't know the stats, but again it's not recommended. You're looking at being a bit unwell, being extremely unwell, or possible long term organ damage. That could be fatal but it's not quick and painless and involves a lot of agony and suffering.
If it doesn't kill me instantly which is possible, i don't want to go slowly by radiation. But i don't know any realiable methods, you can survive even hanging and it is hard to find place so it is impractical. And also jumping some ppl survived like fall from 47th store even if it is rare, but i don't have anything high around like that!

I thought jump + stab myself to heart but problem with that it is hard to locate and assuming you will be able to even stab that deep under angle and then yet jump it could affect my trajectory - probably not feasible.

- Then i thought slit my wrist but that is also fatal only in 6% of cases, with jumping it might be fatal however.

I don't know what i will do if it doesn't kill me instantly or quickly, i don't want to go like super slow way man...

I am confused as in rules i read you cannot tell how to kill yourself but then i see methods discussed and this is not even suicide, i just don't want to suffer most slow painful death from radiation or like survive jumping with broken bones and god knows how long it will take to die and how much i will suffer!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Quickest way to go in case of surviving nuclear war,2644200,anxiousguineapig,"Aug 24, 2024 at 3:16 PM","I've been going through the same anxiety so I get you... honestly though if you expect to survive the initial blast many methods that work normally would work just as well. though if you think you might be on the outskirts of an explosion or something you would need to have a method that you can keep with you. I will point out that it is substantially easier to ctb in an apocalypse scenario like that because there won't really be medical assistance. Something like slitting your wrists is less unreliable when nobody can find you and call 911 and even if it doesn't kill you outright it might weaken you enough to make death a lot faster at least.
Unfortunately that's not exactly true. Plenty of people would be outside initial blast zones, but even for those inside, there's a substantial chance of surviving with injuries (which may or may not prove fatal over the next few days/weeks). Worst case scenario is probably to be trapped in a collapsed building and die of dehydration or infection.

Quickest way to go in case of surviving nuclear war,2650527,Unspoken7612,"Aug 29, 2024 at 5:41 PM","Have you had CBT?

I would say…
- notice to yourself that you are worrying about nuclear war. Pick out specific thoughts and sensations. ""I am thinking about being trapped in a building after nuclear war. This is making me feel a cold feeling in my chest which I call anxiety.""
- acknowledge that this thought makes some sense - it would indeed be horrible to be in that situation.
- Worrying can be useful if it helps you avoid a dangerous situation. That is why your brain worries. However, in this instance, it is not useful. You cannot mitigate the small risk of nuclear war, or have much impact on what happens to you in that scenario. Your worries are an evolutionary throwback.
- Reassure yourself that nuclear war is very unlikely, due to the risk of Mutually Assured Destruction. You don't need to worry about it.
- Be patient with yourself. It's OK to still worry or feel distress, but try to respond in a constructive way by following the above steps: notice your thoughts, acknowledge that nuclear war is frightening, put your thoughts in an evolutionary context, and remember that worrying achieves nothing.

This is slightly less useful if what you are experiencing is more akin to terror, but you might still be able to use it - after all, that's more obviously an evolutionary throwback.",2644368,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a nuclear war scenario, considering that your fear stems more from the prospect of suffering while dying than from death itself, it is highly likely that your efforts at preparation and precaution could be the primary cause of your demise. Should an extreme situation arise where leaders like Biden and Putin lose control, your best course of action may be to head to a major city. This way, you can be vaporized instantly, as it is more probable that dictators and military leaders would target such areas first.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most people in the blast zone would die of burns, crush injuries, or some combination. Some of those deaths would be fast but some would be agonizingly slow.

You are absolutely correct about the certainty of targeting in such a scenario. However, the number of nuclear warheads held by countries potentially hostile to the U.S. has increased significantly in recent decades. This makes it conceivable that the U.S. could face multiple adversaries in a nuclear conflict. As a result, the same number of warheads that might be aimed at government facilities could also be directed at public areas. For a superpower as formidable as the United States, even with a national debt exceeding 31 trillion dollars, the ability to rapidly produce advanced weaponry remains. Consequently, those leading a nuclear assault would likely prioritize civilian casualties, as the loss of millions of lives could be a critical factor in determining the outcome of the war.

A poignant example is the bombing of Hiroshima, where the United States targeted a city full of ordinary people, rather than the seat of the Japanese Empire, to maximize the impact and pressure on Japan to surrender.",2650928,,,,,,,,,,,,

Does Getting SN in Ontario Mean You Will Get a Wellfare Check?,2650908,anxiousguineapig,"Aug 30, 2024 at 12:28 AM","It probably depends on whether they know you've ordered SN. I'm in Quebec and ordered from IC (which was based in Ontario) back when they were in business and when they got caught they gave the list of buyers to local police and I did get visited for a welfare check, as did many Canadians who ordered from them. But since the package didn't go through customs or anything there was no way for them to know I'd ordered SN until they found the payment records which was months later. Similarly, the only way for them to do a welfare check is if they know you ordered SN which is probably unlikely as a suspicious package wouldn't get through customs at all.
Also, if you don't have a prior mental health history it may not be a huge deal if they do a welfare check. Mine was certainly startling but I insisted I didn't know anything and they eventually had to accept it. I don't think they believed me but if you deny it there is nothing they can really do, it's not a crime to order or possess it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Vomiting is extremely likely regardless of if you take it with food (and even if you use an antiemetic) because of how SN works, it's a natural reaction to the poison. Taking it alone helps ensure it absorbs fast enough that you have absorbed a lethal dose before you vomit the rest out, if you take it with food the level in your blood will rise more slowly and you could end up getting sick without dying. Plus, usually poisons/medications are best taken in water because it's really hard to dilute the taste enough.

I don't think it's stupid, so long as your decision to ctb is well premeditated and you aren't making an impulsive attempt shortly after having been heartbroken. It's almost been a year, so you've had a lot of time to think about this since. Ultimately it is your life, you can choose to end it for whatever reason you want and I think it's valid, so long as it isn't done impulsively.

From what you put in the post, it seems it isn't just the pain of no longer having her as your partner that may have led you to this contemplation. Being a hikki, being bullied, being subjected to abuse by your parents, so many people have taken their lives over just one of these.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

i have felt depressed and suicidal regardless of my boyfriend but he is considering leaving me soon because, maybe he feels i can't get better and ill always be a needy depressive failure. if he leaves, i know it will make me want to die but i also know it won't just be because he left me. im not killing myself over a boy but the heartbreak being the obsessive feeling on top of the depression i already have might make it seem or feel that way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was thinking it was like being tied up, and then something takes a massive sharp and jagged spoon and stabs a hole into your chest. then over the course of many weeks or months they slowly scoop out and lacerate the inside of your body, slowly scooping away until they create a concave cavity within you, but you don't die after all this time, and the pain doesn't abate.

Are you responsible if someone decides to CTB after you,2649694,Praestat_Mori,"Aug 29, 2024 at 3:34 AM","The simple answer is NO! We're all responsible for ourselves.

The more complex answer is, that loving parents, loving partners and friends can actually be devastated after a suicide especially when they cannot comprehend why this was the only option. That is the ever unsolvable problem. The ones who are in so much pain that they have to contemplate suicide to be relieved and the loved ones who often come up with platitudes like ""It gets better!"" bc they cannot actually solve the unsolvable problems that make us suicidal.

Someone will have to suffer - this is an inevitable fact. If the life of loved ones is regular and in order they will get over it eventually. However, some may not get over it and may commit afterward (imo that's happening very rarely).

Ultimately, it's their own decision, not ours and not the decision of anyone else.

If I had to answer the question precisely I'd make the following distinction: If loved ones had the ability and the means to rescue me it's their fault if they didn't. If they couldn't rescue me regardless of any efforts it's not their fault at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Are you responsible if someone decides to CTB after you,2649708,Holu,"Aug 29, 2024 at 3:53 AM","it depends on how the suicide is. To me, suicide should ideally be done with awareness and forethought, doneso more out of a desire or knowing inability to continue suffering, rather than a complete spur of the moment action. Even in the situations where the individual is in distress, they should mentally have been prepared or expecting the possibility of suicide during crisis.

So to me, if someone witnesses your dead body, and say you had a firearm in your hand, and they use said firearm to commit suicide out of complete shock and distress, then I'd argue that you probably bear responsibility. But, in almost every other case, the answer would be no.

However if you want to observe it from a classical utilitarian perspective, then one could still argue that if your suicide proceeds to increase the suffering of those who care you, which eventually adds on and leads to their suicide, it could be argued you bear responsibility. That said, the amount of responsibility is up for debate, and it can't really be known.

Yes, it's obviously influenced by external factors, but these factors don't amount to any kind of objective judgement. You can see that demonstrated in this very thread where the people here passing judgement are saying ""no, you're not responsible."" And yet, for you, the feeling persists.

It sounds like your family has maybe been taking you for granted... using you as their rock while not affording you the same in return. Not everyone in your position would stand by and allow this. Some would say ""to hell with this"" and do what they want to do regardless of how their family might react. But you? You own it anyway. Because that's the kind of person you are. It's in your character to maintain that level of care even in circumstances where it's not adequately reciprocated.

Now, I assume these things wouldn't affect this person's life, so why would it be such a huge deal. Also, if this person hated trump its possible they could travel to another country, IDK if they can though.

I do question their investigation skills though - they make it sound like they've been extensively thorough and infiltrated deep into SaSu. Whereas in reality, they've only read some threads, added a few numbers up and re-reported older news stories.

I do feel sorry for any family impacted by death, however it occurs. Wouldn't it be a nicer planet if people were able to legally and peacefully end their own lives, surrounded by friends and family and therefore didn't need to seek someone else to emotionally support them…. or better still have the right support and treatments in place to prevent them from even getting in to that headspace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

SaSu Partners Thread discussed in the BBC,2642980,SketchTurner,"Aug 23, 2024 at 11:25 AM","I saw it pop on the news ticker on bbc news this morning when my mother put it on for the cats. Surprised it made the tv in one way, but I guess it is a sensational story.

I don't think it has to be a slow news days for people to like news about ""hundreds"" of people asking for suicide partners, predators, 100s of SN sales linked to one guy. It is pretty sensational if you're not aware of it.

I do understand it in a sense, the website is generally accused of encouraging suicide by providing a space where people say goodbye, wish them well, and do not say please don't kill yourself. That is a wrong interpretation think.
Having a space specifically to meet partners did surprise me, it does feel like another step of creating a social connection where two parties are ""encouraging"", consenting, nudging each other towards suicide. Even if in private afterwards.
I think the delineation is a fair one - although I have no desire for a partner so I am ignorant to people's motives etc, if people just don't want to be alone. I'm not arguing against it either just saying i do feel it's a different kind of thing. I can see normie saying well yeah that is different, especially the stories in that article.

General caveats applies about not agreeing with undermining people's choice and believing in some imagined supportive medical system that will save them, like the news and people who want to shut the site down believe.",2642931,,,,,,,,,,,,
SaSu Partners Thread discussed in the BBC,2642997,RainAndSadness,"Aug 23, 2024 at 11:47 AM","Suicide can never be a voluntary, rational and thought-out decision, otherwise their entire narrative would crumble and fall apart. I'm not surprised they wrote another article and completey ignored what I said in my last thread deconstructing their talking points. Because they've just called us collectively pro-suicide again despite my refutal, which shows to me any response to these journalists is a waste of time and that's gonna be my position now going forward. They're literally ignoring the fact that everything I've said as site administrator, everything our moderators have said and everything our members said in this forum tends to be clearly pro-choice.

It's clear they're not doing any of this in good faith. They just keep making up stuff and ignore everything we have to say to our defense. Even when they reach out and we refute allegations, it barely ever changes the framing in their articles. And it's been like that for years. Which again, is the reason why we're not responding anymore. They're not interested in following journalistic guidelines and taking into consideration why this forum exists and more importantly, why members use it. The most important question remains unanswered to this day and that's: why do people keep making accounts here, despite all the smearing and slandering that happens in the media? It would be the response to many of the questions these journalists have about our forum. But they don't want to hear it and it's simple, the answer as to why people use this forum doesn't fit into their narrative. And the framing in the most recent article makes it very clear to me it's all about laying out the framework for more legislation to crack down on online speech. It's supposed to weaponize Ofcom and enable them to be more oppressive towards content that violates their idiotic Online Safety Bill, one of the most regressive online bills in history. Why do you think the last paragraph of that article is essentially a plea to Ofcom to take more drastic action against our forum? It's literally that, these journalists don't like we're still around despite all attempts to deplatform us with these articles.

And like, again it's bad journalism. All they did here is essentially summarize what other articles already said about this forum in the past. Like, the partner megathread has already been covered in other reports years ago, just saying. None of this information is in any way a new revelation to anyone. But they know we're not going anywhere, so they have to come up with new content somehow to keep the attention on our forum, to keep the pressure up. That's why they've been recycling ""news"", it's lazy, it's one-sided and to me it's very clear when I check out what these journalists personally think should happen to the site administrators of this forum and to people who sell completely legal products that they're nothing more than mouth pieces for activists trying to shut down the forum, something I've already brought up in my last thread debunking why we're not pro-suicide and they're basically hiding their simplistic and reductive opinion pieces on ethical matters which have as much substance as the average internet blog post as news pieces of one of the most influental news outlets in Europe. They have nothing on us.

Nice drastic increase in guests btw, it looks like this report will backfire once again, leading to plenty of new registrations from members who are grateful they've been guided to our direction because a forum that's pro-choice and doesn't impose views seems to be a pretty attractive place to people who value freedom and individual autonomy, especially when they're struggling themselves with whatever life throws at them. But what do I know. It's not like I've said repeatedly in the past that talking about this forum is the dumbest thing you can do if you sincerely believe this forum is such a horrible and disgusting place. But keep shooting yourself in the foot, all you do is making this place more popular and saying you're not mentioning this forum out of 'ethical concern', doesn't change the fact that the average person can still find this forum with a little bit of research rather quickly and what you're doing is morally repulsive by your own moral standards, okay. Like, ""this forum is horrible and it should go away"" does not match well with ""let's talk about this forum again and again and expose them to people who didn't previously know about this place"" because again, the only advertisment we have right now is the BBC. And it's even free, well thanks a lot.



As for the article itself, not gonna waste any time on it. There are again countless lies in there which aren't even worth debunking anymore, such as ""the thread encourages users to end their own lives - and offers instructions on how to do it"", that's simply wrong and you can look it up for yourself. But as I said, waste of time. It's funny how they're legit spreading fake news for the lols on the internet and now it's my job to fact check them or something. Like they don't even pretend anymore that their articles are factual or accurate, these are just shitposts at this point. It's hilarious.",2642931,,,,,,,,,,,,

To suggest on the article going after her simply because they admit they can't do shit to stop the website is atrocious.

SaSu Partners Thread discussed in the BBC,2643494,Cress,"Aug 23, 2024 at 9:30 PM","I guess they really don't think too much of the people on this website. Suicide prevention methods in the modern world are quite frankly just broken. The number one cause of death for males 20 to 35 is suicide. I know it doesn't affect every single population but that's one of the main demographics of your functioning society In the first world and they're destroying themselves At a record rate.

The system Whereby we pull people out of darkness Who are suffering in total despair is in drastic need of reform but there's been very little movement in that front. The current system really stops at Asking the police to go do a wellness check forcibly apprehending you And tossing you in a psych ward Where you will be treated as hostile and aggressive. Like you're some sort of child that's having a temper tantrum that will soon pass and you just don't understand what's going on. All of your concerns with why you don't want to live anymore don't really matter to this people they're just covering their liabilities.

I already know there's people that are so immediately troubled that the only way you can handle it is locking them in a room With very little interaction but man that should not be the absolute default for everyone who so much as even mentions they want to harm themselves.

They locked people in dormitories with between 16 to sometimes up to 60 other Suicidal people depending on the facility. They hold on to you for 5 to 7 days sometimes a month in certain circumstances and then they boot you out the door to anywhere they can designate that you are at a ""safe place"".

They Give you some numbers for Therapists and psychiatrists and that's the extent of what they do they've washed their hands of it. I stayed at one of these facilities for a month once because I didn't have a ""safe place"" to go to I was homeless and told them to discharge me to my car. They said that wasn't a ""safe place"" for a few weeks but after a month they said it was good enough And discharged me to the address of my car.


What really aggravates me the most about all of this is how They have turned this process of hospitalizing people into business opportunity and these facilities are essentially farming people for money who are some of the most hurt and desperate damaged vulnerable people.

It's absolutely disgusting And I can't even really begin to tell you how angry it makes me seeing behind the curtain so to speak and how these facilities really operate.


These people have the gall to blame People on this website For increasing suicide. When there's literally nowhere in the world that you can talk about suicide without ridicule as if the best strategy is just to ignore it and hope it goes away. Suicide prevention is in desperate need of radical reform get rid of all these crazy profit incentives literally farming some of the most abused people and actually help them.

I have this radical idea where maybe when someone is suicidal you try to actually address those fundamental issues? It's pretty radical I know. I guess we should just stick with the current system where everyone's problems can all be solved with medication. Yeppers.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's the same cycle for most if not everyone : School>Job>Marriage>Kids

Thinking about the fact that I might have to endure more of this for 20-30 years makes me nauseous.

I don't think the joys of life have ever been able to erase the misery everyone is forced to go through.

All of this just feels so pointless

Why put so much effort into surviving in a world full of suffering ?

So I guess in summary, myself is the actual cause of my need to CTB.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I consider it easy in comparison for me, if I still had it, because I can just do that and be done: I've done what I'm supposed to and my guilt and shame can die with me.

The backup method is hard. I spent 12+ hours puking when I decided to abort. But if I were determined enough, it would work.

Prison seems easier in my mind than making another attempt by the backup, although I guess we'll see. I may regret not taking that option when I had the chance.

"Should I tell ppl about what I plan to do? I attempted talking about assisted suicide but got ridiculed, now I ordered SN",2565441,mellie5,"Jun 18, 2024 at 2:09 PM","Hello -

answering your question quickly, almost in every country it will create for those who listen the obligation to call for help, as if they don't, they are liable for not helping in an emergency.

Tbh just by asking the question it seems to me (and ofc I must be wrong) that you are somehow - even subconsciously - seeking help. Idk your situation but many times ""impossible"" situations have a possible solution, but since depression clouds judgement, you cannot see the solution.

I am not being a shiny-happy here but did you make sure you don't have depression? bcs wanting to CTB is a symptom of depression and this impairs judgement. They say I have to CTB bcs I have no food and you put a roast chicken in front of them and say I can't eat it, I have no food and must CTB.

While I completely respect a sound decision to CTB, a decision to CTB while depressed is not objective. Again, I have no idea about your situation and I may be saying things that don't apply to you, but I have the impreassion that you are depreased and it could go away.

Yes, ik here it's full of people who say meds and therapy don't work but consider that those with a successful treatment are extremely unlilely to post here :-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,

My order of Amitriptyline, Digoxin and Benzos have arrived.

This means I have 3 of the 4 medications required for the DDMA protocol.

I also have Propranolol, so could do the DDMP protocol, although I've read the DDMA is more successful.

I do have Oxycodone which could possibly be used in place of Morphine, but I'm still unsure on that.

Benzos I've been able to order from my home country too but only one kind (Diazepam). Ordered other types internationally (Xanax, Clonazepam. Lorazepam etc.)

Amitriptyline I have a script for but would take me a good few years to save the amount required, so I bulk ordered internationally.

Moving my date,2649535,hoppybunny,"Aug 28, 2024 at 11:57 PM","so um, i recently posted a long winded rant about moving my date and in the rant i said some really bad things that i don't really want on the internet. This is why it's important to have a journal lol. But my main point was that I was moving my date up from Oct 2026.

That point remains the same, but instead of August 2025 like i said in the post, i'll most likely do it oct 2025 on my 21st birthday, or during december with my parents aniversary.

I'm choosing those dates cause I think the worst day of my life was my birth so I want to die the day i was forcefully brought into this world. Or on the day my parents made the choice to tie the knot and eventually have me. Basically I don't want them to be happy thinking about how they brought me here without my consent.

This isn't a guaratnteed thing though. This is only if I get to those dates and I still hate being alive. If something changes like IDK, i fall in love or i find a job i really like, or i move away from them, then i probably won't go through with it.

I have a job right now, so i will be saving up to probably get a gun lisence and a gun, and enough for an uber and a one night stay at a hotel. (sorry to the poor workers). I'll try the hyperventilation method on my bed first a couple of times and if i can't get it right i'll blast my head in the bathroom(so it's easy to clean). That way I don't chicken out. If I fail in october cause I chickened out, I'll try again in december.

But yeah some things happened with my mum and I realised, I really was tired of this whole getting yelled at for dumb shit and called names on the daily. And tonight I decided to switch from my graduation to those dates because i just spent a good 20-30 minutes being told by my dad that i was wrong for getting a job and that i'm disrespecting them and undermining their authority by getting a job my mum disaproved on (i literally got a job at essentially an arcade for a good amount too). And basically it's my fault for not being calm and collected when my mum starts yelling and taking every choice i make personally. If i say more I'll get pissed and end up saying something I'll regret again. but long story short. It's my fault for not coming back to discuss with my parents after they yell at me and call me names. and that if i storm off and get angry nothing gets acomplished. But my question is why are they allowed to get angry and call me names but i have to be calm and collected. I want to get angry and yell too. And then to make matters worse my sister told them how she felt and my dad was like, ""she's wrong, that's not how we are. We're very loving parents."" like fucking bullshit. So my mum telling me i'm ugly, a pig and embarassing to be around is out of love? got it. i'll make sure to keep that in mind if my future partner says the same thing.

but yeah.
tldr, moving my date from october 2026, to oct/dec 2025.

Also me killing myself isn't trying to be like a stick to my parents or anything to make them suffer. They'll get over it pretty quick. my mum literally told me she wouldn't care if i killed myself because she has 4 other kids to replace me. she went on this whole thing about how she had multiple kids so she'd still be ok if one died. and how my paternal grandmother is the same cause she has 8 kids (should be 9 but one was a miscarriage unfortunately) so she's still ok even after 3 of them died. Which is such an insane thing to say.

so um it's not to prove a point. I just wanna kill myself. I do feel bad for my siblings though. I'll leave them each a note telling them i love them. I'm not really scared of hell anymore now that i've picked a date which is nice. I just need to remever to burn my stuff especially my books and art stuff and sketchbooks. and um erase all my devices. I'll leave my devices for my little brother since he's a streamer and needs better equipment. So um I hope it will help him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not a saint in this regard either, I'm prone to lashing out and being a dick multiple times over. The thing I want to see changed is normalizing accountability by owning up to being an ass and saying ""I'm sorry for doing this, I'll be more mindful"" instead of just either doubling down or running away from the one they've hurt when they're confronted. I get it, hearing someone was hurt sucks, but look past the emotion and see what they're actually saying. Just read the actual words. Take some time to recover from the emotion if needed, and actually read what's being said. If they've got a point in their hurt, just tell them you realize you fucked up and apologize.

I don't have the courage to go from passive suicidality to active suicidality,2626824,ijustwishtodie,"Aug 10, 2024 at 3:33 PM","I just don't. I like to fantasise about death a lot but I don't think that I have the courage or endurance to actually kill myself. With every passing moment, I feel a desperate urge to be dead as I can feel more and more responsibilities piling up on me. Gradually, my parents want me to be more responsible and to be more active. Gradually, society wants me to be responsible and to be a wage slave. I can't take it anymore. I'm going insane from having to tackle with so much. Due to my autism, I'm extremely sensitive to suffering, pain and pressure so I can't handle much on my plate. My head feels dizzy from just washing the dishes.

I need to kill myself sooner or later as I'm going to go insane from all of the responsibilities piling up on me. I hate that life requires so much effort. Because I get worn down easily from having to deal with life related shit, I know that I'm also going to get worn down easily from having to deal with a suicide attempt.

In truth, the most comfortable thing for me to do is to avoid suicide and avoid responsibilities as much as I can. However, I can't avoid responsibilities if I don't die. I need to go against my ""path of least resistance"" mindset if I'm going to actually kill myself but... I just can't. I hate this. I'm forced to survive against my will because I don't have the courage to end it all.

I'm going insane. I feel like I'm going to have a meltdown soon from having to deal with so much in life. I get extreme headaches almost everyday from just being stressed at the thought of dealing with being an adult. I don't know how to go from passive suicidality to active suicidality. I don't want to be forced to survive through my life for as long as possible. I want it to end early so that I can be freed from the cruel fate of being a human. I think that it's unethical to force me to stay alive when I get so easily overwhelmed at life.

I've not been a ray of sunshine or anything- why would I be in this world, I'm not that type- but I've at least been polite, if not only out of a desire to get people the fuck away from me faster. Kept the rude thoughts on the inside because drama is exhausting and all of the circles I'm in are like high school cafeterias all the damn time. Throw anger on a private Instagram account and run to keep the peace.
I've been more….i don't know, filterless. I'm not saying slurs or anything, I don't even think them frankly, I'm just…a bit of a bitch. I've lost a few friends from this change in attitude- fair enough- so I can tell people are noticing.
I realized that it's..not exactly a cry of help, more of my inhibitions lowering now that I've confirmed my plans. I'm not gonna be here for long, so why even try? Might as well make sure everyone knows what I think before I finally CTB. I've heard of a lot of reactions to confirming intentions to commit, but I've never seen my exact experience.

We can't know what really happened to the others, it could be the worst, but I'm pretty confident that it will most likely be lethal if there is no intervention and you keep down enough of it.

IDK what the ""correct"" syringe is but from your other post where you said you loaded multiple syringes for IM use it sounds like you may be using insulin needles. Since you are dissolving powder, it's better to use a higher gauge so it doesn't clog. Something like a reddit community for shooters might be able to help more.

Saline (for practice I assume?), tourniquet and bandages can be found online or a pharmacy since most have diabetes care products.

I'm not a expert but there are reddit subs for IV drug enthusiasts. I will say that street users do not carry saline around and will shoot up with water from a puddle in the street if they have to. The water is simply to dissolve the product. Also, in your past post you mentioned boiling your F. Cooking in a spoon is to hasten the dissolving of the product in the water and possibly disinfect.

We had a small discussion about it, before my parents started saying I need to lose weight and find a husband in law while I'm at university (I'm already with someone...)

I have narcparents and I have an adult brother who's in his mid 20s, he abused me his entire life but nobody wants to admit it. He physically assaults me and most importantly verbally assaults me... He calls me a bitch, a prostitute, a whore and a retard. He pushed me down the stairs the other day. My mom is obsessed with him. She won't leave him alone, she's literally obsessed with my brother. My brother is her life, she spends an unlimited amount of money on him. He got bought a sports car when he was 18, since he liked cars. We were homeless and living on charity from my aunt at the time. He got a sports car and we were homeless. My dad just listens to my mom.

My brother came home from a holiday and they're happier about that than the fact that I got into college and I'm the first person in my family to do that. They're obsessed with my brother, my brother is a serial rapist who got out because the victims parents couldn't afford a case. I try to say he can't live with me because he's abusive towards me, they called me delusional and stupid and said me crying was stupid. They tried to say he never hurt me and never touched me and I'm delusional because they never leave me alone with him. They proceed to leave me alone with him.


I'm alone and nobody cares I got into college, I don't even want to go because it traps me in this house for years.

Je sais que personnellement sortir dans des endroits où je peux rencontrer des gens et faire des activités en commun, comme des bars à jeux, me remonte un peu, j'essaie aussi de faire fonctionner les sites de rencontre (en espérant y arriver un jour) et je suis membre de serveurs qui font du jeu de rôle et de société pour ça. Mon souci est plus de l'ordre d'une malédiction traumatique qui agit comme une barrière irrationnelle et me fait perdre ce à quoi je tiens mais j'essaie désespérément de la détruire enfin...

Je ne pourrais jamais vivre à la campagne actuellement à cause de ça, même en aimant la nature, il faudrait qu'il y ait une communauté forte qui te permette de faire des rencontres, des activités et ne pas rester seul. Je te suggère de rechercher si ça existe par chez toi.

Overdose,2641053,Bapremp,"Aug 21, 2024 at 5:58 PM","So, i've decided to jump ship because of several permanent and now untreatable illnesses that completely has ruined my life, were the worst one is a neurological disorder that gives me a ton of visual and cognitive disturbances on top of 24/7 depersonalisation and derealisation.

Anyways, i would prefer to go out using a firearm or OD on Fentanyl, but were i live both are pretty much impossible to get a hand on, so i'm left with hanging or trying to ODon regular heroin mixed with other central nervous system depressants.

So my question is, do you think that snorting 1 g of 65% pure heroin (i have 0 opioid tolerance) combined with like 100 grams of promethazine and 40 mg of Clonazepam would do the trick? I might add that i have a high benzo tolerance and i am on 6 mg daily, i tried taking 10 mg a few weeks ago and i didn't feel any sedation at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overdose,2641084,Tesha,"Aug 21, 2024 at 6:30 PM","I'm sorry that you find yourself here because of your medical conditions.

1g of 65% purity will most likely be fatal, as long as you're not a very large individual. I think (but would have to look it up again) around 600mg is often quoted as a lethal dose. The promethazine / clonazepam will further depress your CNS, but you may risk vomiting that amount, so not sure it's worth the risk.

I wish you well with whatever you decide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overdose,2641516,Bapremp,"Aug 22, 2024 at 3:11 AM","Yeah, it sure sucks, because i really want nothing else than to live and prior to them i overall loved life, but it's reached the point were i can't endure the agony anymore. It's like i'm trapped in a burning buildings window, and i have to chose between jumping and end the suffering, or remain in the window and keep feeling the unbearable pain from the flames. The world sure ain't fair...

It's a risk and it should be fatal, but i quess the 600 mg is if taken IV, which makes it quite a bit more potent than snorting it. And i actually hoped that the Promethazine would minimize the chances of vomiting, since it's also an antiemetic drug. But if i were to do this, i would've taken the Promethazine and Clonazepam and wait around 1-1½ hours so they reach their peak plasma levels before taking the heroin. If i were to do it IV i'm pretty much certain i'd die, but the problem is that i would most likely not get the full dose in before i nod off.

PS, i just looked at my countries site that provides information about meds, and under ""Overdose"" it says that 60-100 mg of Oxycodone is a lethal dose for a person without opioid tolerance, and that's for slow release tablets, and heroin is way stronger than Oxy, no?

God it's frustrating that i can't get a hold of Fentanyl, some Nitazene or a firearm, then death would be certain (if aimed at the brainstem), and way faster.

I decided to prepare a trauma-warning poster for ctb,2650415,plan c,"Aug 29, 2024 at 3:32 PM","Whilst researching about method a problem plagued me: How would other ppl deal with my body?

I plan to do it in a hotel so I suppose the hotel staff would be caught unprepared when they see me dead in my room. This could potentially leave whoever getting caught traumatized.

Thus I decided that along with my goodbye note I should also leave sth for ppl who potentially do the cleanup. It should be obvious and thus prepare the cleanup person for the traumatic scene or give them an opportunity to call the professionals. So it'd better be a poster that I could fold into my backpack and stick to inner walls of my room.

I should start making the poster some time before I ctb and I decide to take some time completing it. It could be just plainly ""DEAD BODY WARNING"" in large font size, but I want it to be somewhat artistic and creative since that would be revealed to public and will be among one of the few meaningful things I would leave behind. I'll also take the chance of making such poster a procedure in mentally preparing for ctb. a.k.a. for the fact that I would be gone.

SN & Benzo dosing suggestion question,2650350,uniqueusername4,"Aug 29, 2024 at 2:35 PM","Hi,

I thought I had everything that I need for the SN method, except now I don't think I have enough benzos. I just realized when I was reading back through the really detailed thread that you need way more than I have, it suggests: oxazepam (20x30mg tablets), Valium (diazepam, 50x10mg) and the off-license, bromazolam (10mg). It says you can use any benzo, but these are the dosing suggestions.

I have 4x0.5mg of lorazepam (so 2mg total rn) and I definitely need to get more, right? It is kind of confusing because the max dosage on all the benzos is different. For example, the diazepam says that up to 400mg per day is a possible maximum dose via google. And then with Lorazepam the max is 4-6 (google had multiple answers for that one). So it seems like I should be aiming for about 25% more than the max dosage per day based off the diazepam example. If I am playing it safe with Lorazepam and saying that 6mg is the max daily dose, then 7.5mg of lorazepam would be needed?

I just want to make sure that makes sense or am I completely off? I haven't figured out where I am going to get the rest of the benzos yet but I might just try and get the suggested dosages of the medications in the detailed thread to be safe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I saw that too, was thinking it might be good to mix up 2 cups but I also saw that even if you vomit it up within the first 10 mins it is still effective and that taking 2-3 doses could just make the vomiting piece worse and have you ingest less so I am CONFUSED on that bit.

Is methadone OD better than SN?,2602884,MountainMan99,"Jul 20, 2024 at 7:42 AM","Hello everyone, so i recently saw this thread here on SS, that shows a video of a dude apparently taking 1 gram of methadone and he seems to just pass away peacefully and without vomiting or having to take an Anti-emetic.

Btw that video is NSFW.

So it made me wonder if one has access to DN markets, and is able to obtain methadone, wouldn't it be a better option than SN? As long as you're not found in time, so you don't suffer brain damage from hypoxia and still be revived.

Because with SN, you will most definitely turn blue/grey from cyanosis, you might vomit even when unconscious, leaving a gruesome scene to whoever finds you.

It just seems more peaceful overall, but since there is not much information about using methadone to CTB, and i also didn't find anything about it in the PPH, i would to ask anyone here that might know if it's a better option that SN to CTB or not.

To what point does “second chances” sound like an excuse to avoid confrontation?,2650336,moonlightwhisper,"Aug 29, 2024 at 2:27 PM","My sister and I have been moved to a foster care home because our previous parents were abusive.

My sister has always had a habit to lie, get angry so fast and yell at me despite asking a simple harmless question. It has worsened ever since we moved in here. Because she knows our new parents are more loose with rules and doesn't often call out on her behavior.

Which in turn made her into a destructive machine. If she doesn't get a slightly expensive item she yells for hours until her throat is dry, and can never accept defeat if they don't relent or set a compromise that's satisfying to her.

Lies a lot and twist stories;

Again she cannot accept defeat or the fact that she's wrong in a lot of situations. Always gotta blame us or threaten to call the cps to take us away again, because they're neglecting her (a whole tantrum just because they said no to letting her out at night with friends)

But the thing is, they're equally as bad. They keep enabling her behavior to avoid fights. I swear to god I just want to strangle them all and myself sometimes. And when she asks for money, she gets it despite not working for it. Letting themselves get yelled at for no severe reason. And when I do tell my foster parents why they can't stand up FOR THEMSELVES FOR ONCE ITS ALWAYS THE EXCUSE OF HER DEALING WITH THOUGH STUFF FROM CHILDHOOD. And that we have to give her a second chance

Honestly I'd be a millionaire by the amount of times I've heard that sentence from our six years of living here.

One thing that especially boils my blood. Is the time my sister almost punched our mom over a situation and I had to hold her back. My sister slipped and somehow got her dress ripped and instead of apologizing she demanded for compensation for the dress.

Do you know how crazy that is? That's one more bizarre situation to add to my collection.

Do believe I hate my foster parents too for various of reasons I will not write here. Or else this post will be endless

But if I knew this would be the outcome of my future. I'd keep quiet about my abusive household when I was little.

I'd honestly rather suffer physical abusive everyday than a mental one

I used to get told to ""sit in my room and shut the fuck up"" or I'd get whipped with the belt (or whatever she could grab) as well as get my mouth washed out with a full bar of soap for crying about it. Fast forward a few years (8years old) and I was raped by one of her (now) ex-boyfriends. The very next day she dropped me off at my father's house and told me she wanted nothing to do with me and that I was his problem now.

A year later she tried to come back into my life and pretended like nothing happened, wouldn't acknowledge it or talk about it at all and I would get the belt if I brought up anything even close to the subject of her ex (at this point they broke up). Fast forward a few more years, I have kids with two different women (different relationship times - not a cheater). By this point I'm 16 and was forced to drop out of high school by my egg donor to take care of my children, except she didn't want me having anything to do with my kids because ""I don't do anything right"" and contact with both of my kids is eventually lost even though I kept trying, but most of messages went unread, deleted, blocked or just plain unanswered.

It should be noted that the first relationship I was in, she was 17 and I was at the end of my 15th year when she got pregnant, she was a HUGE heroin addict at the time, and cheated on me with everyone. The second relationship I had we were both 17 and together for 8 years, however she cheated on me for the full 8 years with another guy.

Fast forward to 2018, I catch pneumonia which actually turns out to be Non Hodgkin's Lymphoma (cancer). I was at stage 4 at the time (near death) and was extremely lucky to get pneumonia, otherwise I would have died. I did two years of extremely intense radiation chemotherapy with a partner who at the time I thought was a good person, but she never went with me to any of my chemo appointments and we constantly fought, usually about money.

In 2022 I was officially declared cancer free and in remission and my partner at the time and I decided that we would sell my condo unit that I owned and move from NH where we both lived to AL where her parents lived. The plan was we would put all the money into building a house on her parents farm and live a nice easy life. We move down to AL and spend about 70,000$ (most in cash, forced by her parents) on stuff for the house we were going to build and then she turns around and kicks me out, saying she wanted nothing to do with me and I was a failure as a person and had no future being with.


I moved back to NH after 2 days of almost non stop driving, with 3,000$ to my name and a year later I found a partner who I thought would change everything, she seemed perfect and sweet and nice to me and we were together for a year until yesterday. She wants me to out before a new lease is signed and I have talked to my dad, (his opinion is that I'm 33 years old and to suck it up) and his wife but they aren't really happy about anything and those two people are the only two people I have in my life now, and the only thing they've really cared about is how much money I can make and how good of a job I can get.

I don't have any friends, I don't have a social life, what I do have is years of trauma, anxiety, add, adhd, severe post traumatic stress disorder, and there's only two hobbies that interest me, photography and gaming so I'm unsure if I'm on the spectrum or not.

I say all of this because I've never wanted to live, I've never agreed to it and my entire life all I've gotten is hurt, all I've seen is suffering and pain. What the fuck is the point anymore of trying? Everything in my life has gone to shit every single time and I've never wanted an out more than I do now. I'm at a loss of what to do because half of my brain is saying just leave this planet and half of my brain is telling me think about staying but the simple fact remains - I KNOW I don't want to be here anymore. I just don't.

Sorry the post is so long, my DM'S are open. Thank you for reading the full thing if you did, I just had to get this out. I'm unsure where to go from here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

My posts tend to drift off topic as I go into details, so I trim down most of what I write. I want to be concise; using few words without losing the message. This means trimming details, looking up synonyms, rearranging sentences, and removing paragraphs that I managed to summarize in a single sentence. I also change my mind about what I want to say several times throughout this process.

And in the end, I post only half of what I write. I'm an opinionated person but am well aware that I shouldn't always voice my opinion, especially if I'm out of my depth on a topic. Sadly, this happens to be the case quite a lot. Nevertheless, I write down what I want to say as a means of voicing my thoughts. If what I write would contribute to the thread then I post it. If not, I let it die as a saved draft unless I revisit the thread later and change my mind.

Edit: yes, I'm jealous of people who manage to post their coherent thoughts on the first try.

My posts are long if I have a lot to say and they are short if I don't have much to offer to the discussion. If I write something and read through it and feel like part of my post went off topic then I delete that part.

I'd say just write whatever comes to mind and don't overthink it. If you can't get your thoughts in order then you can just take a break and come back to your post later. That's what I usually do.

With the rope you're using, tie to something high enough, and then hang on with your hands, both feet off the ground. Kind of jerk around on it and see if the knot holds up. If it doesn't, you may need to go down to a 10 or 8 mm rope. The thicker the rope, the harder it is for a knot to hold.

Ich verlinke mal englische Threads dazu:

ich habe diesen Thread hier gefunden zu EEBD, SCBA, SCUBA versus Exit Bag:

Inert Gas: EEBD/SCBA/SCUBA
The exit bag was the first mask to be used for inert gas asphyxiation. However variations using different masks (EEBD/SCBA/SCUBA) have popped up. There is no comprehensive resource that I know of exploring the pros and cons of each so I will share what I know in this thread. Feel free to make...
sanctioned-suicide.net

Und hier die Set-Ups der Mitglieder... https://sanctioned-suicide.net/threads/inert-gas-setups-gallery-show-your-setup.115461/

ich begreife die Unterschiede zwischen den Masken nicht und was man jetzt kaufen muss....

Hier ein Bild von EEBD - emergency-escape-breathing-device....
Constant Flow Emergency Escape Breathing Apparatus EEBD SEKUR CAP SNC 15
Allows a safe, effective and uncomplicated escape from hazardous environments with the minimum of user training. G 26 test is not necessary.…
ekastushop.de

Kann ich mir das so vorstellen, dass die Maske dann ans Gas angeschlossen wird und man es statt der Umgebungsluft einatmet? Wohin geht die Ausatemluft? Und braucht man einen Adapter um ihn an die Flasche anzuschließen? Diese EEBD kauft man wohl oft in Kombi mit Atemluft und der Zylinder müsste extra gekauft und angeschlossen werden....

Dazu ""better of buying EEBD hood and hose (with a connector on its end), as opposed to the whole EEBD setup of hood, hose and small air cylinder with cylinder bag.""....

Hood is die Mütze, Hose ist Schlauch und was auch immer für ein Connector man dann braucht...

Und dann gibt es noch diesen SCBA - self contained breathing apparatus (Atemschutzgerät)...
da sollte man auf alle Falle einen mit positivem Druck nehmen, damit keine Umgebungsluft eingeatmet werden kann....

Dann steht da in dem Thread:
SCBA and SCUBA trade an external gas regulator for an adapter to a built in regulator. See links for details.

Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof....

____

Vll hat hier jemand schon mehr Verständnis bzgl der Masken....



Ich hänge auch noch da... Da ich meinem Magen mit der Aufnahme nicht ganz traue, bin ich noch nicht endgültig entschlossen....",2255321,2255323,,,,,,,,,,,

Protonitazene as Substitute for Morphine in DDMAPh Protocol?,2649195,teddexter,"Aug 28, 2024 at 5:41 PM","Given that protonitazene is more potent than morphine and a lot cheaper on DNMs, I'm wondering if it would be a viable alternative to M in the DDMAPh protocol in the PPeH.

how legit does my plan sound?,2589659,black.dahlia,"Jul 8, 2024 at 2:31 PM","im planning on attempting soon. i know i keep saying that and not doing it but i promise i mean it lol. my method is a regular tourniquet. i have no access to firearms and there is nothing in my house sturdy enough to hold my weight without breaking. this is the next best thing.
after reading about the night night method, i used that guide to find my ""sweet spot"" on my neck, but instead of using a ratchet on myself, i found a pair of old leggings and a wooden spoon laying around. (the idea i was going for is to look as inconspicuous as possible while also being functional) after speaking to a member here about a year ago that also left us this way, i think this has a decent shot, albeit not fancy. as also stated in The Last Five Acts, an emergency style tourniquet with household items has proven to work at least a couple times. so im not being totally stupid here.
because i cant do this anywhere but my house, id have to find a way to keep people from not only interrupting me during the act, but also not finding the body afterwards. id much rather the police find me than an unsuspecting household member. i was planning on locking the door i do it in, possibly barricade myself in the room a little bit, (our door knobs barely work) and leave a timed text message/ physical note on the door saying to call the police and not to come in.
after thinking on it nonstop, the most i can muster up for notes are just shitty apologies for basically everything i did, going past just the suicide. ill trash my journal, but keep a couple pages, so people have an idea on my mindset. the suicide should be enough indicator of my mental state already.
my date is still undecided. i feel like a good push to avoid SI would be to do it when my adrenaline is high and im in a crisis. my head is so clear and set on this i know itd be easy for SI to kick in during the act without an active strong motivator, so thats the best i got.
poke holes in this. say whats good about it and whats stupid. i need constructive criticism in this. my method isnt the most reliable, and im not in an ideal environment/situation a person dreams to ctb in. dont be needlessly mean, lol. i just want to do this right. thank you all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

to expand a little bit; i have zero experience or access to firearms, and my house is super old. there are places i could see being able to hold my weight, but those places are out in the middle of the house. if i dont ctb in my room or a spare, itll have to be the bathroom. im not doing it in the middle of the living room or something.
the doorknobs are also over 60 years old, ive checked. i could def try and test the newer ones out though, but id have to get materials for partial.
also, ive been practicing the tourniquet method for a long time since that post ha ha, i know that on this forum people think it wont work and ill end up braindead, but in my personal opinion- i feel like people say that because of how difficult it is to figure out. the more i practice, the better plan i get. its weirdly touching to me how (even though people can be really rude in their delivery) that yall are concerned enough to tell me to find a different method. ive given myself a grace period, so ill look into partial as well absolutely. my choices have gotten less restricting, so im able to actually go outside and get the ropes that are needed and stuff.
but for the past couple of weeks ive devloped a way better plan for tourniquet by just practicing it over and over. im not in a rush to die, so i do it to calm me down and ground me, if that makes any sense? i have a way to get the rod to stay in place, and i found different ways to pad my neck so the skin doesnt pinch and the knot stays where its supposed to.
i know im weeks late and this is super long lol, my bad about that. but ive missed being able to freely talk about my ctb like this on here. im still open to chat, im way more mentally sound as of right now (best way to ctb!!)",2623611,,,,,,,,,,,,

My only close family, Mum, is in a care home, with cancer as well as other medical issues and sadly is suffering from confusion - some days worse than others. I can no longer have a serious conversation with her. I'm about to lose our local authority owned home of over 40 years and having to dispose of countless personal possessions, many with sentimental value, because the only alternative accommodation I've been offered is literally no larger than a prison cell with no space for even a single visitor to sit and enjoy a cup of tea. The costs of renting/running said accommodation will all but bankrupt me as I am single and on a low salary and I don't qualify for any financial help. So I've effectively lost everything I've ever lived and worked for. The thought of spending the next 20 or so years alone and in solitary confinement makes me feel physically sick. I have a method to ctb in mind which I hope would prove successful. I think it's the only way I can find any peace and escape the constant worrying. Spending my life alone and worrying about paying bills or if I can afford groceries is not, in my opinion, living. And I see no point in existing if there is no benefit to me of doing so. I have prepared my Will, written instructions for my funeral and made other preparations so that my affairs can be wrapped up efficiently after I've gone. I simply don't see a way out of this mess.

Stupid question about SN,2650065,Ethernatuskoi,"Aug 29, 2024 at 10:02 AM","So, recently I read some topics and information about SN and a question arose in my mind. People always talk about drinking NS using a specific regimen and with a group of specific medications to alleviate uncomfortable side effects, and that said, I wonder: what would happen if a person drink SN without the regimen and in an amount greater than the recommended one ? It seems like a stupid question, I know, but I really am curious. I personally believe that the person will vomit a lot and the effects will cause a greater degree of discomfort, but at the same time I wonder if taking a higher dose will accelerate the effects and drastically increase the level of death. Would it be extremely painful, uncomfortable and the suffering would be greater, right ?

I'm only asking this because recently, I saw someone who took a micro-dose of SN just to test the potency of the product, and according to reports, the person felt the following symptoms the first time: tachycardia, hard stomach, pain head, and after a supposed 15 minutes, he felt drowsy and slept, and the next day, he woke up and no longer suffered any side effects. He also reports that he did not feel like vomiting, as he took a microdose, that is, a very small dose, but it was enough to cause a series of side effects in his body...

He also took a second microdose, and this time, things were different. This time, he developed a headache and dizziness after several days. And based on this, I think: if a microdose is enough to cause high damage and side effects of this level in a person, I wonder what a dose above the recommended dose could do after ingestion...",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stupid question about SN,2650076,Agon321,"Aug 29, 2024 at 10:13 AM","More is not always better.

It won't do you any good to drink a large dose if you suddenly throw up everything/most of it.
Our body perceives SN in lethal doses as poison, so it tries at all costs to get rid of SN from our body. A higher dose increases the likelihood of vomiting.
Additionally, as you mentioned, the symptoms will probably be more intense.

The schemes were not created for fun, but to increase the chance of success.
Fasting and an appropriate dose of pure SN are absolutely the basic rule that everyone should follow.
Additionally, antiemetics are highly recommended.

The standard is 25 grams, or 35 grams if you weigh over 100 kilograms, so it's worth following this rule.
But of course a smaller dose can kill.
I think even 20 grams may be the standard in the future (if SN does not completely disappear from the radar). But that's just my interjection.

In conclusion, I don't think it's a good idea, but of course someone can correct me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Stupid question about SN,2650111,Ethernatuskoi,"Aug 29, 2024 at 11:05 AM","I may be wrong, but I THINK that if a person takes a large amount, for example, and vomits, I believe that even if they vomit, there will still be a considerable amount of substance in the body that will cause the person to die, but of course, this has a cost , as the degree of discomfort will be much greater. I'm only saying this because I believe there is a possibility that the body will not be able to get rid of all the substance through vomiting, and what is left of the substance could take your life.

These are just some thoughts I have, theorizing possible damages and effects, but I'm obviously not going to put this into practice, to be clear.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yet I was treated like shit. Like utter shit. At the last psych ward I was fully and I mean fully strip searched when I came in. Never saw this happen with anyone else. I had already been in the ED for a few days at that point just what exactly were they looking for I never tested positive for drugs, that I needed to be humiliated and treated inhumanely like that. Nurses liked to go on massive compensating power trips. Lack of empathy from most is common in my experience. If you need anything it is treated as a monumental inconvenience. I'm there because Literally said I'm going to give you a chance to restore my view of hunanity and show me a little and not kill myself. Yet even that low low low bar just be kind and empathic was too much.

If you have a psychotic break sure go. Depressed. Nah you'll regret it. They aren't going to care about making you better. They just don't. The people I was with weren't capable of caring or making you better. My situation isn't terribly complex. Yet it proved too much. It really shouldn't have. As someone who was in medical school.

The nurses had to sedate him after I told him it was just a fictional story.

I would suggest that people reach out to them and tell them their story and how the way depressed and suicidal people are treated in hospital make it more likely that they will not seek help in the future. I think I read somewhere that studies have shown a high correlation between hospitalizations and successful suicides.
If you don't think it will make a difference, remember that before mental health advocates started to raise their voices, people were sent to state hospitals against their will, without a strong reason . Many of these people would wind up being stuck in these institutions for years. Now, unless someone agrees to go to a state hospital, the only way they can be sent is if a judge finds them unable to care for themselves
I believe it depends on the locality. I live in New York City. My first inpatient experience was relatively positive. they sent me to a small facility in upstate NY. Most of the patients were not really psychotic, so you could actually talk with them. My second experience was much worse. I was in a hospital lock down unit, surrounded by actively psychotic individuals, one person was actually put in a padded room. It was extremly traumatizing. I believe that if we speak up like the advocates did 50 years ago, we can foster positive change. Why don't you try reaching out to a peer run agency. SAMSA is a good refference site that might link you to groups in your community.

You cannot treat depressed and suicidal patients the same way you treat psychotic ones. A depressed person who experiences these type of incidents are likely to leave the hospital traumatized.
We need to make our voices heard, depressed people should not be treated like criminals, we should not be subjected to the trauma of living on a unit with violent and psychotic individuals.
I'd advise you to reach out to NAMI. Tell them about your experience, and how it made you feel. We need to build a groundswell of angry voices in order to create change.

I just wanted to say that you might not always feel the way you do now, and that maybe the older you get, the more you will hopefully be able to accept yourselves. I used to have bad BDD when I was in my teens, twenties and thirties but I'm 51 now and I don't have BDD any more. It started fading away in my forties. I look ok with makeup on but am very unattractive with no makeup, but one day I just stopped caring about what I looked like and it was such a relief. I have gone from being unable to go out the door without an hour's worth of makeup to sauntering happily out the door almost completely barefaced (I still use a tiny smudge of concealer on the broken veins around my nose).

I wouldn't want to re-live my teens, twenties and thirties for all the money in the world. It was a horrible time and it was horrible to care so much about my appearance.

I hope, for all of you who posted above and for anyone yet to post in a similar vein, that you just wake up one morning, like I did, and care a lot less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm less than flattering in appearance to say the least and feel as though I am unworthy of friendship, for instance.

The only thing keeping me from being more than ""bleh"" about it is working like a dog 6 days/week and having little free time. Looking in the mirror, accidentally opening the camera app on my phone, or seeing my reflection in something always results in a fleeting episode of despondence, like the 5 stages of grief in 60 seconds.

I cross trained with running. It was a massive part of my life. Then in 2022 when things happened I've discussed here before just a couple weeks later I reinjured my back from an injury a couple months beforehand. I've dealt with several other injuries since hand issues (fracture vs dupuytren's contracture, back issues, torn labrum in my hip, just injuries accumulated through the years). The injuries combined with my just complete and utter destitution as a result of the crimes committed against me in march of 2022 and abandonment of everyone. My diet which was extremely regimented has had to be utter shit because I have no money and food is a luxury for me at this point.

so pure fent. that's like saying pure gold. 100%? No. even the stuff hospitals use is cut down. just not improperly or laced like a street drug obviously. I say purer because some people I am placing my trust in say that a way-too-impure sample of fentanyl was the problem. like way below 1% or something.
I know nothing about drugs, so to find a pure-er sample of fentanyl I have to ask for help. so many people are saying low purity is the problem. then surely one of you knows how to get higher purity! eh?
I can go on that damned site and browse the fentanyl listings again looking for purity but I have no idea what to look for. And maybe someone has a better source than me?

The only thing they accomplish in my experience is keeping you from harming yourself while you are there, for the most parts.

They make token attempts at therapy - but therapeutic relationships take time to build and opening up to a psych ward therapist to have to start over once you're out is dubious. Not to mention, making a connection with one is unlikely. One had a daily group session, but it was of limited value.

They will likely forcefully medicate you. That medication can be useful, but is unlikely to match the regimine you're prescribed once you're on the outside.

The food is terrible. The beds/rooms uncomfortable. People smell (showers, deodorant, oral hygiene and fresh clothes are all limited). The vast majority of the time there is simply nothing to do, besides perhaps watching TV with no control over what you're watching. The staff is often burnt out. Lastly, your fellow inmates can either be great, or more often miserable.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's just really a place where they can safely test different medications on you without the risk. I don't think I benefitted from any of the groups or the psychiatrist but I did make a couple of good friends while in there, unfortunately contact dropped after being discharged but I do cherish the relationships I made during one of my hardest times.

I was kind of just invisible. The first time in the US was a mixed bag. Shortest stay in the US. Best food and best facility. Staff were mostly caring. That said it did nothing to help me. I saw the doctor once and I was there almost three weeks I think.

The latter two times staff was mostly uncaring, nurses on power trips many of whom probably should've been in on the otherside to work out whatever issues they have. A few people were okay in terms of staff especially the last time. 3rd was a shit show and none of the staff I have good things to say. Lazy would be the word I would use. Patients an afterthought.

All in all none of the times have i been helped even in an insignificant way by going. Wouldn't recommend. If you expect a nice, caring environment it isn't it. If you expect a doctor to give a shit about you or care about anything other than cashing a check it isn't it or going to happen least as far as US docs.

How was the psychward/hospital for you?,2640122,banger12,"Aug 21, 2024 at 12:21 AM","Edit: this went on way longer than I expected and I'm so sorry but I truly hope you appreciate the detailed response and that some people can make good use of thr information provided. Some people feel they have benefited from psychiatric units and may have needed them, but overall I have a very negative impression of these place, so warning I'm biased. I've been admitted to different psych units a couple times and so I described what was generally true of most or all of them here. This is by no means comprehensive and there are things im probably forgetting to add by mistake or would only be relevant to one facility. Keep in mind though that this is based only on the personal experience of myself, patients I've talked to at these places, and observations I've made while there as a patient. I hope this helps you or someone else. Please enjoy.

Edit #2: Forgot to note that every time no matter the facility I've had my phone, wallet, etc confiscated as per usual policy, without fail. They do allow visitation times (usually a pre-scheduled hour each week) from family but have rules around it like hug/physical affection prohibitions. And you have phone call hours where you can make calls out using a shitty landlines. Also, for context, I'm an American male, in case that information sheds further light on the matter.

I've been to psychiatric units a total of 3 separate psychiatric units in my life, 4 times in my life in total, 2 weeks each (except for final one). Idk if that counts. They werent their own dedicated mental hospital and it wasn't long term so idk if it counts as a mental hospitalization. Each time I was there it was over CTB related stuff. Twice as a minor, twice as an adult. Two of these happened during covid and idk if they are at all representative of any hospital experience nowadays.

Mostly uneventful but here's a few details. Keep in mind the is representative of only my experience and its very possible quite a few other facilities are different. You have no access to therapy at all. You'll likely be talking with a psychiatrist or a number of other docs and maybe a social worker or some shit. But you won't have access to therapy or emotional comfort. Also btw the docs and staff don't care what you think, only what they want.

They will have ""group therapy"" if you could even call it that. There will be other group activities to, some of which are supposed to be fun and some that are supposed to teach you skills, all of which felt useful or unpleasant. Btw they track your participation on that stupid shit and it counts toward your discharge.

Depending on the unit you'll either be able to order from a list of options that they cook up in the cafeteria or you'll be escorted to the cafeteria and everybody will eat the same stuff, it's not great but not terrible.

Other patients are a mixed bag. Most are cool but obviously it's a psych unit and you don't know why they're there, what their motives are, if they're being truthful etc, so caution is valuable. However given that you're all there together you'll likely befriend some other patients and bind over shitty life experiences and being stuck in a medical facility. It's to be expected this will happen, especially with no access to therapy or other emotional support, however it's technically prohibited, so these conversations typically don't happen until the neglectful staff are out of ear shot, which is often. There will likely be a couple unhinged patients who may make you feel unsafe at times and you'll have to be around them, and I still always felt bad for them. And patients sometimes fluctuate or oscillate between being pleasant to disturbing. Some patients value their time there, but most become more jaded about the whole thing the longer they're there and the more they get to observe.

It's possible you'll need to share rooms, you're not going to get any privacy. Fuck, you can't even shut your door half the time. Your room will be so suicide-proof even down to details like the faucets and toilet paper holders.

However, you're there to be ""stabilized"" which is some kind of HR/PR Newspeak for ""forced onto medication that likely won't help"" which for the sake of comedy I'll refer to as ""pharma slop"". The staff for the most part don't give a fuck about you or other patients, with some exceptions, and quite a few actively resent the patients, sometimes openly so and express it. Some staff will be regulars. Patients will pick favorites out of the very few kind staffers. It's not universally true for every patient (although certainly true for the majority) and it's never stated explicitly, but there's an unwritten rule that if you want out you have to agree to start some pharma slop, which conveniently they're ready to send a prescription out to your pharmacy as soon as you're discharged. In fact it feels almost like a war of attrition to get you to fold and just submit to having the pharma slop shoved down your throat and whatever else they want you to do. It happened to me and I was on tons of meds for 2 years after the fact. There are some other criteria for discharge, some better and reasonable and some that are really bad, but the medication/pharma slop shit is obviously noteworthy. However, I suspect it may be possible to run out the clock with insurance at these places based on some remarks docs there made to me at the time, however I'm not sure so don't quote me on that.

I want to clarify btw that I think some people do need these places and that I'm not necessarily anti-medication. But it feels like over-prescription is endemic on these units and it feels very corrupt regardless. Plus, rarely do patients feel helped. I'd wager there is a financial motive involved, if not with the individual staff or facilities (which is possible) than in how the whole system is designed in the first place. It's also noteworthy that people who are depressed, anxious and suicidal are placed in the same facility among patients with very different, much more extreme/severe mental illnesses.

They will hand out notebooks and suicide-proof pens. They claim to respect your privacy. Don't believe them. From what I understand those are routinely checked and I've had other patients tell me about incidents in which staff has used journal entries against them.

In terms of episodes of abuse or SA I'm unaware of any committed by either staff or patients at any of the facilities I've been admitted to, other than one patient who would expose himself to female patients, as well as the odd attempted unit hookup or relationship. This stuff is pretty bad and concerning, but these were rare incidents and not full blown SA, although it certainly is enough to make one worry for their safety, especially since among the patients plenty had stories from other facilities of worse being perpetrated by both employees and other patients. It's not impossible that at some point some really bad incident occurred at the facilities I was at. Small note, when I get admitted to these places, typically they force you to strip in front of a staffer and then change into the shitty hospital clothes, ig because they worry about elastic wastelands becoming makeshift nooses or that you may hide razor blades in your box cutters. From what I understand this is standard procedure at most places but it's incredibly invasive and it's easy to see how a predator could take advantage of that. And given all the paperwork you're forced to sign god knows what rights you're signing away or how legally protected these facilities are.

I think these facilities also demonstrate the moral bankruptcy of suicide prevention as an action, idea and motivation. A pretty decent chunk of patients were repeat admissions and never experienced any long term benefit from them. But many people report having suffered as a result of their basically forced admission. Many end up committing suicide eventually anyway. So these institutions seemingly generate harm more than they reduce it.

I was very cooperative and honest while I was at these places. I didn't benefit. Some do but I git discharged the honest and productive way during most of my stays and I basically submitted and gave in to everything they wanted. Never benefitted. Ofc I can't speak for everyone but I hate these damn places.
I am so surprised they let you have access to electronics, although this is not unheard of. I had a friend who went to one but was allowed access to their phone. I always had my stuff confiscated. And yeah they're horribly unpleasant places I'm so sorry you were thrown in there.
Thank you for sharing. My experience was very similar to what you described here, although I felt that I was pressured into taking medication and I questioned the motives/intent of the people there. But to an extent I can see the value in having patients in a facility to start and change meds instead of in the outer world
I'm very happy you had a good experience and feel you have benefitted. In the US it's generally a lot worse.",2639076,2638996,2639113,,,,,,,,,,

Increasing Time to Unconsciousness with SN,2609382,justwannadip,"Jul 25, 2024 at 10:34 PM","So like many, my chosen method is SN and I have it with me for when I need to go. For me it was the most accessible method with a high enough success rate and low enough reported pain threshold. What worries me however, is the time it takes to reach unconsciousness. As someone with high anxiety, OCD, and a strong SI, I fear calling for help is a real possibility once taken. I have benzodiazepines, which may help sedate me a little, but they don't eliminate my anxiety nor produce complete unconsciousness with lack of awareness at high doses. To clarify, by unconsciousness I mean a coma-like state where awareness and feeling are null; I am not simply referring to feeling tired, sedated, or going to sleep.

So my question becomes, what other drugs or methods can be used to increase time to unconsciousness with SN?

Please add any information that you are aware of that may be helpful for those that deal with this as well. Also, if any of these drugs interact negatively with SN that would also be useful to know.

Barbiturates

Thiopental - similar to N, shorter half-life and fast acting. Accessibility is poor (its considered a controlled substance in North America), I've only seen it being 'sold' on India Mart but that site looks super sketchy. If anyone knows a more reliable way to get barbiturates pls dm me.

Phenobarbital - slower acting barbiturate with the ability to act as an anesthetic. Similar to thiopental, it is a controlled substance making it difficult to obtain.

From the information I've gathered, these 2 barbiturates are difficult to obtain, although they are easier to get than sodium pentobarbital (formally 'N').

Opioids/Nitazenes

Fentanyl - produces unconsciousness rapidly at high doses intravenously. Can be difficult to obtain (street connections, or DNM) and risks being laced with other undesirable chemicals or compounds. Purity is questionable (I'm unsure of how one would go about testing).

Nitazenes (proto, eto, etc.) - similar to fentanyl but estimated to be more potent. Difficult to obtain and test to ensure purity.

Morphine - while it is possible for high doses to cause unconsciousness, it is unlikely that this would be prior to death. High doses can lead to respiratory depression while still conscious.

Benzodiazepines

Benzos are rather straightforward so I won't bother mentioning the different brand names. There are slow-acting, moderate, and fast acting benzos, but as long as one times its administration so that its effects are at its peak shortly after SN consumption, it shouldn't matter much. As mentioned before, benzos can be crushed to speed up absorption and reduce time to peak effect.
I will clear something up that I've seen mentioned several times on here. Benzos are NOT an anesthetic and do not lead to unconsciousness. They have sedative properties and can certainly cause you to fall asleep, but that is much different than being in a coma-like unconscious state. You are still very likely to feel and be aware of pain and sensation, although due to its sedative properties, these may be slightly diminished. You are likely to feel more relaxed, although SI and anxiety are unlikely to be eliminated, but instead mildly to moderately reduced. As someone who has experience with benzos, they don't make me fearless, non-anxious, but rather can induce a calming effect that slows things down and can make it easier for me to fall asleep. Anecdotal experience may vary, but the literature does not point to benzos as having anesthetic effects or to reliably lead to unconsciousness at high doses.

Conclusion

This is not an exhaustive list, these are only the drugs that I have researched. If anyone knows of any drugs not mentioned here, please mention them as it may be helpful to many. Also, if you happen to have knowledge or advice on how one may be able to get the more difficult-to-access drugs (ie.barbiturates) on this list, feel free to share—my dm's are open as well.

I begged for the last time today,2649410,Indomie89,"Aug 28, 2024 at 9:11 PM","Today I begged the person I love for the last time. I begged them to stay with me and never leave me so my thoughts of suicide can lay in the shadows of my thoughts. I have BPD and abandonment is a huge trigger for me, possibly due to fostercare. Living with BPD is tiring. I don't ever feel at peace. My emotions are on constant fight or flight. I'm constantly begging for love and approval. Today he rejected me and then said "" stay for another month. Life is good. Be happy."" I cried. I pleaded and said please, just stay with me so I'm not alone. I looked pathetic, crying in front of my school on the phone. I told him how much he doesn't understand the pain and loneliness I feel. He's a twin. I'm an only child. I'm not close with any family my age. I spent about 4 years in fostercare. I never really had friends as a child. I have always felt alone and watched people have the closeness i so desperately desire. For the last 25 or so years I've been dealing with depression and suicidal ideation. I've been wanting to die for so long but my fear of pain and the unknown keeps me trapped even though I've spent nearly 2000 on firearms and ammo. I'm in nursing school and I'm currently a case manager, working with kids to give them the love and safety I wish I felt. I feel empty. I can no longer give what I don't have. I want the pain to stop. I wish I mattered. I wish I wasn't alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I begged for the last time today,2649430,justkatie,"Aug 28, 2024 at 9:24 PM","BPD is extremely difficult to deal with.

Just a fair notice to anyone who reads this. BPD is not rational, it's not able to simply step back for a moment and have a think.

Abandonment is a VERY real and upfront fear in a BPD relationship. Even one that's going well. Anything from a small disagreement to your partner not replying to a text for an hour can make you genuinely feel that the relationship is over and that either you, them or both of you are absolute wastes of space.

I've threatened ctb to ex partners before because of tiny things.

It's hard to deal with because you're taught in therapy to take a moment, take a step back and think about things rationally. ""Does this one minor disagreement REALLY mean it's all over?"" BUT the BPD brain explodes into action instantly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I bought meto and it is stated clearly on the pack ""10mg pills"".

Sometimes a pill might say ""take up to two four times a day"" where another might say ""take two daily""

It's mainly because drugs are made for uniformal use and what you might only need to take one tablet a day might mean two tablets twice a day for someone else.

For example a smaller dose of a drug might help someone with problem A, but a larger dose of the same drug might help someone with problem B.

Sometimes, I wonder how people will react if I do CTB. I don't want them to be upset. Sometimes I think they may be angry though. Then, I start to have similar thoughts really.

From what I could gather from reading a few poison control FAQs, most products are fairly non-toxic. You could get drunk off alcohol based products, but it doesn't sound like anything fatal. (Maybe over continuous use, but vodka would taste better and contain more alcohol). You'd probably get really sick.

Many products are much safer these days because people will drink things like hairspray or rubbing alcohol in large amounts to get drunk. Having worked security in the past, I've seen people get black out drunk on isopropyl alcohol and survive. In some cases, doing it for mamy years.

In the chance that you find something lethal, it would likely be slow and agonizing. Failing could mean some serious damage that will make you feel much worse than you do now.

Bleach or drain cleaner would be much more dangerous. However while those would likely fry from your throat down to your stomach, causing excruciating pain as it eats its way down, it probably won't kill you. But you will be damaged pretty badly.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

My relationship ended. It devastated me. I won't go into too many identifying factors, but I realised I was living for her.
To be honest, I know it's unfair on her, that she is my world. It's something like co-dependency or whatever.
But we gave so much for each other, and it feels like she's cast me away so easily.

Now I'm where she found me. I was close to CTB in 2019, a year before we met. I found reasons to live, like my dog and my responsibility to her, and other silly things like fomo for the future.

But now I have to start from zero, for the umpteenth time in my life. I'm tired of it.

The moment she broke up with me I went and bought the materials I needed. The breakup had been a possibility, and I had started researching methods. What I found, long before I found this place (which was only a few days ago) was the helium method. I planned thoroughly, or so I thought, but I was too distrought to be thorough. I bought a body bag, an oxygen mask, and planned to do it in the shower with the water running while being extremely drunk and high, so I could drown if it failed.
The helium failed. I tried to drown myself. My will was strong but SI was stronger. I now know what it's like to be on the edge of death.

A mess of things happened next, and I was taken and detained in a mental ward. I cooperated, because what's the point.

But now I'm out and determined. I think I've chosen hanging, my timeline is short because my ex will be back at the apartment at the start of next month. I have no intention of leaving my home, I have no intention of struggling on for a meaningless life I've wanted to end since I was 10. I've enjoyed as much as I can and suffered as much as I can endure. I know the depression is a sickness.

But the truth? The only thing that has brought me peace in this time of turmoil is deciding to CTB. It brought a tranquillity to my mind. I am at peace with it.
My only issue is reliability and not ending up waking up in a hospital maimed or permanently damaged. That would hinder my future attempts, and it would just continue the suffering.

Why the hell is this so hard to pull off? It's damn annoying.

I feel bad for deceiving my friends... but I've been honest with them in one thing: I have no will to live.

Tourniquet method guide,13759,Sanctioned Suicide,"Jul 2, 2018 at 10:11 PM","This is the summary of the compression chapter in Five Last Acts for the lazy ones in our forum.
This guide is wrote by me this time, I hope it's comprehensible enough. I want to make this as simple as possible.

What is the tourniquet method?
The tourniquet method consists in compressing the carotid artery which is the blood vessel that supplies the head and the neck with oxygenated blood. If this vessel is closed quickly by pressure (3 kg), as in hanging, you will faint in 10 seconds and die in the next 15 minutes. The trick of the method is to simulate the pressure you would get by hanging yourself. And you do that by tightening a ligature above your Adam's apple (ex: scarf, towel, blanket, shoestring, cable) with a rod (stick, broom, pen, spoon, etc.).

The method


1. Find objects which you can use for the method. I will use a scarf and a stick in this guide, as models, but you can use anything you want. Even a shoestring and a spoon.

1.2 Find a place where you can sit and in which you're confident you'll be left alone for at least 1 hour.

2. Now you want to place your scarf high on the neck, above your Adam's apple, and tie a knot that won't slip. The gap between your ligature and your neck must be about three fingers. Insert the stick in the loop, close to your knot.

3. Apply pressure to your neck and begin to turn the stick. You will turn it clockwise. You will stop turning it when the ligature is tight enough to make you feel dizzy.

4. If you feel dizzy you'll now let go of the stick, If you do not feel dizzy it means that you didn't apply enough pressure to compress your carotid artery and you need to start again. This might take practice.

You will now faint in 10 seconds and die in 15 minutes.

But this method doesn't seem as effective as partial suspension. Partial suspension hanging is the best way in my opinion and if you want to be sure to die you need to work something else in to it. You can put heavy duty plastic bags over your head and tape them around your neck to secure them and hang yourself using partial suspension from a doorknob and use a slipknot. Either way you need to do some research before you even make an attempt. A failed attempt will leave you brain dead. I suggest going to LostAllHope and reading up a bit on there.",41234,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just laying still for 30-60 minutes in bed while focusing different parts and energies on awareness will convert the low energies, the pressure, and the stuck energy, perhaps even some ""demons"" in your body that you have been carrying all day (or longer).

Would an overdose of painkiller work?,2649666,RedSauce,"Aug 29, 2024 at 2:49 AM","I apologize in advance if I formatted the thread incorrectly, I'm new here and pretty dumb :(

Just wanted to ask - is it possible to die by taking two packs of painkillers at a time and then drinking them with alcohol (all I have is about 250 ml of carabala mixed with vodka)? And if possible, how painful would it be?

I live in a country where English is not the main language, so I can't tell you the names of the drugs, but here's what they say on the packaging:

1. Metamizole sodium + Pitophenone + Fenpiverinium bromide.
2. One film-coated tablet contains the substance - ibuprofen sodium dihydrate 512 (equivalent to ibuprofen 400 mg) and excipients.

Can't tell if my family is toxic or i am toxic,2643090,retVarii,"Aug 23, 2024 at 1:24 PM","Sorry if this post is incoherent. I feel like my parents have poisoned my life. I don't know if i can call straight up abusive, but i feel like it's fair of me to call them dysfunctional. But the thing is, I can't tell if my situation is really that bad, or if I'm just exaggerating. I'll tell you what i have pieced together.

Like, my mother. On the outside, she seems all cheerful and friendly to strangers, but around me (and other relatives) she behaves completely differently. Even then, she isn't always terrible, but she disrespects my privacy (always bursts into the room without knocking), keeps insulting other people (unless she meets them in person…), and she isn't doing anything useful to improve my mental state (i suspect that i'm depressed). But what frustrates me the most is how she constantly gives me silent treatment when i do something wrong (like i don't know, when i lose something like sunglasses on a plane and freak out about it). And not only that, if i *then* try to reason with her (like, I just have trouble controlling my emotions… do I really deserve to be treated like this…?), she becomes actively hostile to me, at times even yelling at me… I don't even have to talk to her if she's already acting like this, she'll just burst into my room and speak to me in a hostile tone. She just makes me feel like complete failure. And she never does anything with it, it's almost like she wants to perpetuate this cycle…

As for my father, I used to think he was preferable, because he didn't interact with me that often and didn't hurt me as acutely (ridiculously low bar…), but looking back, he really isn't any better. He is just… stupid. He keeps rambling when i'm clearly not interested. He keeps overeating and destroying his health. He is the one who brings money to our family, and yet he doesn't resist his wife in any meaningful way. Like, a common scenario in our family is my father doing some stupid shit, and then my mother going on about how irredeemably stupid he is, and then they just keep bickering.

I kid you not… every time they get into a disagreement, she does to him everything she does to me: gives him the silent treatment, cries, insults him, while my father desperately tries to knock sense into her with his pathetic ramblings. All of this while i have to sit in another room and listen to all of this… Well, unless I am the one she bickers with, the one who she insults and shouts at…

It's unpleasant to admit, but sometimes i almost wish I had these sort of batshit insane parents instead, who would always shout at me and subject me to physical pain, so that I could clearly see how fucked my situation would be, and maybe others would too, and maybe I would have a chance to escape… But then I have this terrifying thought that even then, I wouldn't be able to tell how bad my situation is, because I still wouldn't know what it's like to have a functioning family…

I am sick of this. I feel like a person like me should have grown up with a better family, but i don't know how reasonable that is for me to ask. I'm just so confused. I have spent 20 years in this clusterfuck of a family and i have learned nothing about the outside world, other than the fact that apparently everyone around is wicked and that i should somehow accept it.

Is it… too selfish of me to wish to break free from this…? I writing all of this in such detail, but i don't even know if i'm being truthful. I mean, nobody does anything with it, so… am i just selfish and ungrateful? How can i know??? Is every family like this? Or am i just remembering the bad parts, and my family is actually a safe haven? Or am i being gaslit…?

I don't even know how to ask for your thoughts here. I mean, you can tell me what's your impression from this text, but there's only so much i can do, since i can't introduce you to parents so that you form your own conclusion or something. All I want right now is to get SN and finally calm down, knowing that maybe one day i can escape this…",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Is it uncommon or highly nit recommended for people here to meet?,2648827,Grumble,"Aug 28, 2024 at 1:04 PM","If you want to meet people on here, I'd suggest privately messaging someone who piques your interest and seeing where the conversation leads.

I would advise against openly advertising yourself as being interested in meeting up with a stranger, especially if you're female.

What you could do instead is maybe post a couple threads relating to your interests, see who responds and whether you feel any relatability to anyone. Then before privately messaging someone, check out their post history, look for more relatability or possible red flags.

Tell someone you trust IRL (preferably multiple people) what you're doing. If they ask and you don't want to tell them the topic of the site, just tell them it's private and that you'd rather not go into details. Make a check-in schedule with a trusted person. If you meet up with someone, check in with your trusted person according to a schedule. Include video calls as part of that schedule. Establish a code word or phrase you could use to indicate duress. Before going anywhere private with the person or getting into a vehicle, text your trusted contact a thorough description of who you're meeting up with, including car description (license plate), and location details if you can. (A picture or two wouldn't hurt either...)

TRUST YOUR INTUITION.

Even if it's your intention to keep to a public place, make these precautions anyway. Predators know how to manipulate people and talk others into doing things they wouldn't normally do or intend to do.

For the person you're meeting up with, be open with them about the precautions you're taking. Anyone who is worth meeting up with will understand and accommodate it (well, except for pictures, which might be asking a lot even for the most innocently-intentioned). And they could be taking their own precautions as well. If they don't understand or seem upset about it, I would view that as a pretty big red flag.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

jumping in front of train,2649411,pain6batch9,"Aug 28, 2024 at 9:12 PM","I have a story you might not want to hear, but here goes.

So I actually tried something similar to this once. I was in a drunken morose state to an extreme degree and found myself heading for a point that I could access the railway line, near to where I used to live. Managed to place myself on the line walking away from the station, with my back to oncoming trains. It was night. It was drizzling with rain, which I knew at this point of the line, (I'm a railways buff) at this time after rush hour and in this weather it was unlikely the driver would see me in time.

But me being intoxicated, I wasn't fully aware of all the factors. As it happened, a member of railway staff must have seen me access the line, probably on CCTV, and made the drivers aware there was a trespasser on the tracks north of the station.

Stumbling along the line in the dark, (which isn't an easy walk) I heard a train approaching from behind, all be it travelling very slow, assuming the driver was on alert. The noise of the grinding wheels got louder and louder behind me. And it was at this point, I lost my footing on the wet ballast between the sleepers, and stumbled to one side, just as the train passed me. To this day I'm about ninety percent sure the train struck me on the knee as it passed, going less than about five miles an hour now, the driver must have seen me and slammed on the breaks. I could gauge the speed because the train came to a complete stop about thirty metres away. Those metro services never really got above sixty miles an hour, but if the driver managed to stop that close he must have been going really slow.

This was the first time. There would be another.

I do regret this episode. Later in life I watched a documentary about what it can do to train drivers who experience hitting a person on the track. It can be really traumatising and most never drive a train again. Now, I don't say this to make you feel guilty. Or to suggest a person is selfish for using this method. After all, this is a risk drivers take when they sign on the dotted line. They're taught during training that these things happen. But for me personally I'm so happy that during this time my plan never came to fruition as I would hate to think I was responsible for trauma in this way. Although you could make the point that I would never have known about it.

Additionally, this does broach the question about the planning of the act, including the thoughts about involving other individuals, whether it's against their will and who is going to discover the scene you leave behind. For me, after my railway episodes, I decided not just to carefully plan the act but to involve as few other people as possible.

But like I say, I have no right to speak for everyone.

And: I might have hurt my knee later on, climbing over a wall.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I get my Nemb. and other meds to make sure it goes well directly from Dr and pharmacist. I have other reasons for ctb and had 4 attempts in my lifetime. One successful but brought back from death by paramedics and hospital. Was so angry when I found out. Has that happened to anyone else? Well I know there are many reasons I seen here over the time I been on this site. If you want to give another reason that is fine. Wish you all the best journey to whatever you plan for yourself and may it be what you wanted. Peace.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In NYS it is also known as the MAID Law. Each state is different and as I explain here this is for NYS. The state passed a bill couple years ago and just recently passed another one adding some people who will also qualify and leaving it up to Dr. to decide which drugs you can get. Makes sense due to illness you might have and how different life ending drugs could affect how your death happens. Peacefully is the goal there. It is called ""Dying with Dignity"". That is the name of it. It is for us. People suffering with life ending illnesses or very slow painful illnesses that would be horrific to endure for long term. After going through all the required hoops and tests and mental health evals, which almost stopped me from being approved I did get it. I am in. Here is the RX my Dr has given me.
If you choose to go the way of Hospice it is different. Including Heroine and Morphine. Hospice is expensive! Can't even die cheaply these days!

Option 1:
Drug Dose range
Pentobarbital 1–15 g
Thiopental 1–2 g
Secobarbital 9 g
Phenobarbital 3000 mg

2
Chloral Hydrate 20 g
Pentobarbital 9–15 g
Antiemetics: Metoclopramide 10–20 mg Ondansetron 8 mg
Analgesics Morphine15 mg-3 g
Morphine is optional. He said Pent. / nembutal with the other meds here will be quick and peaceful end.
By Law I must be alone no one to assist me in any way.
This is only for those with fatal medical condition which will be extremely painful or suffocating for long period. This would end that suffering.

lIn the end I wish for you or anyone on this journey the most peaceful safe journey to whatever road you choose. Try longer to survive best you can or take the other option when it is right for you. ctb as we say here. Love you all.

We are in an exclusive club for which most people would prefer Not to be members.

Totally lost it in the woods,2649322,slamjoetry,"Aug 28, 2024 at 7:46 PM","I'm gonna try to keep this as brief as possible so it doesn't come off like a huge sob story. So I have no friends, no money, and my life has been on a complete downward spiral for years now. It's important to note for this story that I also have severe bipolar and schizophrenia, and have missed my last few doses of medication at the time of me writing this.

Today I made the mistake of looking at my ex's social media, and saw that she seems to be doing just fine. I know I should be happy for her but instead I totally snapped, going completely into an episode of psychosis. I got up and drove to the edge of a forest, and stumbled my way through it, crying and screaming ""help me! somebody help me!"" After an hour I ended up kneeling down next to a fallen tree, praying over and over for someone to help me (even though I've always been an atheist).

Somehow I still got service in the middle of the woods, so I got desperate and called that bullshit 988 number. They picked up and asked ""how can I help you?"" and I immediately hung up. Then I called my ex and it went straight to voicemail since she blocked me, and I sobbed and said ""help me help me help me"" for three minutes. I don't even know if you can hear voicemails from a blocked number but I hope she doesn't hear it.

After that I calmed down, I think from pure exhaustion, and realized that I was totally lost. But eventually I somehow ended up wandering my way back through to the road. I dropped down and laid on the road for a few minutes, hoping a car would come and run me over. But I realized they'd probably just stop and call the cops instead. So I picked myself up and drove off.

I'm at my grandma's now (I'm temporarily homeless at the moment), and she has no idea what my day was like. I'm exhausted, dirty, itchy from mosquito bites and poison ivy, and I don't even know what to do with myself.

Guide: Making SN with Sodium Nitrate and Aluminium At Home! ( + Bonus: How to extract SN from curing salt),1999907,Dying science gal,"May 14, 2023 at 4:51 PM","Aluminum-Based Oxidation of Sodium Nitrate: A Simple Approach for Acquiring Sodium Nitrite (SN)
a_user et al, 2023

This study explores a practical and safe method to produce sodium nitrite (SN), a chemical compound with diverse applications, by oxidizing aluminum with sodium nitrate. Amid increasing restrictions on SN due to safety issues, this method ensures accessibility to SN for legitimate uses. The experiment involves heating a mixture of sodium nitrate and aluminum, followed by dissolution, filtration, and re-heating, resulting in the production of SN. The project emphasizes the significance of maintaining access to SN for various crucial applications, offering a straightforward approach that can be safely conducted using common materials and equipment.

Background
Sodium nitRITE (NaNO2, hereafter abbreviated to SN) is a chemical compound that has been widely used in various industries and applications due to its unique properties. While its usage has become restricted in some jurisdictions due to safety concerns, such as the recent increase in popularity of SN being used for suicide, it is important to recognize the value and necessity of making SN accessible to individuals.

SN has a range of legitimate and essential applications across various sectors. It is crucial for food manufacturers as a food additive, ensuring food safety, extending shelf life, and maintaining quality in processed meats. In medicine, it plays a vital role in treating cyanide poisoning and methemoglobinemia. SN is also valuable in industrial settings, where it is used in manufacturing dyes, pigments, corrosion inhibitors, and rust prevention. Additionally, it contributes to agricultural and horticultural practices by serving as a nitrogen source in fertilizers and controlling pests. By allowing accessibility to sodium nitrite, individuals, such as amateur chemists and chefs, can an extremely enjoyable time working with SN safely. It is of my opinion that the prohibition of the distribution of SN is completely irrational for many reasons, of one being how easy it is to make out of non-restricted substances.

Note
TALLman lettering is employed throughout the article to prevent the confusion between sodium nitRITE and sodium nitRATE (mostly for myself so I don't get confused). In addition, the abbreviation, SN is employed solely for sodium nitRITE, and never used for sodium nitRATE. In addition, the discussion of whether if sodium nitRITE should be restricted, and whether if individuals have the right to a fast and peaceful exit is out of scope for this article for legal reasons. Nevertheless, it is critical that we understand that there are numerous indisputably legitimate and essential private uses of SN, and therefore, access to SN should be maintained.

The method utilized in this project has been determined by the results of this poll.

This article is split to two sections. First being a tested method of creating sodium nitRITE with aluminium and sodium nitRATE. The second is an untested method of extracting sodium nitRITE using curing salts based on solubility of SN and sodium chloride (table salt). This untested method will be posted in a comment after the publication of this article.

Goals
The goals of this experiment is to determine whether if it is possible to reliably oxidize aluminium with sodium nitRATE to create aluminium oxide and sodium nitRITE.

Reaction
3 NaNO3 + 2 Al ⟶ Al2 O3 + 3 NaNO2

Materials and Equipment
If you need help finding anything, let me know via a private message! If you want to substitute since you can't get something, feel free to send a comment and I can let you know if it would work!
1. Hot plate or other heating device like a stove (household is fine) or a bunsen burner
2. Good thermometer if you are not using a hot plate (Amazon carries those, you don't need one if you can make sure everything is under 300C)
3. Sodium nitRATE - 2-3x more than you want the product (SN) be, if you're confident you won't mess up.
4. Aluminium (Household foil is good enough. Be sure you didn't accidentally buy tin foil! Buy the cheapest ones your place sells since that is less likely to be contaminated - get two rolls just in case. Powder preferred!)
5. PPE
- Fume hood (preferred) or googles and N95+ mask if you don't want to breath in smelly fumes
- Gloves (Disposable)
- Lab coat if you have one on hand
6. Very clean water (distilled only! Make sure it has 0 added minerals. Reverse osmosis is NOT good. Tap water is NOT good. Regular household boiled water is NOT good. You can buy distilled water from any pharmacy or grocery store).
7. Borosilicate beakers or pans that you won't use after this.
8. Sodium nitrITE test strips (You can buy these from any pet shop)
9. Coffee filter/paper

Procedure
BEFORE STARTING ANY PROCEDURE, PUT ON PPE!
1. Sanitize all equipment. If you are using a pan, there can be absolutely NO oil on it!
2. Shred lots of aluminium foil (0.25 the mass of the amount of sodium nitRATE you are using as the reactants)
3. Pour out sodium nitRATE (approx 2x the amount of sodium nitRITE you want to make).
4. Mix the sodium nitRATE with the aluminium in a beaker or pan. Mix it well!
5. Heat everything up. Keep it below 300C or else the SN could disintegrate! Heat it for 1 hour.
6. Once it is heated for one hour, add water to the container SLOWLY. Wait until all the powder is dissolved. Test the solution with the test paper to see if the amount of sodium nitRITE is satisfactory. If it is, stop to step 14.
7. Filter the solution though the coffee filter. Make sure only liquids pass through.
8. Boil the liquid and dispose of the filter and the stuff in it as household waste.
9. Once the liquid is boiled, add as little water as possible for everything in it to dissolve.
10. Use more aluminium foil to make a ""box"" with open top.
11. Put the liquid solution you have made in step 9 into the ""box"" and then scrunch up the ""box"", making sure that all the powder stays inside the ""box"". Make everything tight (not too tight. (If you need more explanation, drop a comment)
12. Heat up the scrunched up aluminium foil with the powder inside for 1 hour at less than 300C.
13. Skip to step 6 and repeat.
14. Filter the solution through the coffee filter, and then boil off the solution.
15. After boiling off the solution, you should be left with a powder. That powder should be sodium nitRITE!
If you have any questions, do not hesitate to send a comment below! I don't bite~

Disposal
Heat sodium nitRITE to 400C for sodium nitRITE to be decomposed to harmless chemicals. Then dispose in household rubbish. DO NOT dispose sodium nitRITE in household rubbish without decomposing first!

Testing
As of May 14, 2023, the SN produced as a part of this experiment has not yet been quantified. However, we plan to test the substance with FTIR spectrometry in the coming weeks. We will comment on this thread once the results are made available to us.

We will add images in the near future!

Bonus: How to extract SN from curing salts - two methods:

Goals
This section describes two methods to extract sodium nitRITE from a mixture of sodium nitRITE and sodium chloride (table salt), which is usually present in curing salts. Note that the methods below are untested.

Method 1 - Solubility
It is well known that salt is significantly less soluble than SN. Therefore, we propose the following procedure to separate SN from sodium chloride.

Note: The yield on this is absolutely terrible, since there just isn't that much SN in curing salts to start with, and solubility filtering is bad in general. But it should still work.

Materials - Curing salt (lots) - Tall cup, bottle, or graduated cylinder (x2) - Heating device, such as fire or hot plate - Coffee filter (A few) - Paper towel - SN test kit (You can get this from any pet store. You only need this if you want to test it.)

1. Put the curing salt into a tall cup, bottle or graduated cylinder.
2. Add large amounts of water to the curing salt.
3. Shake for 10 seconds (Seal the cap). Uncap, and then pour liquids through coffee filter. Pour the stuff caught in the coffee filter back (after drying, if there's lots) or dispose if there isn't a lot.
4. Boil out the filtered out liquids, until only solids remain. Repeat steps 2 through 4 with the curing salt until you have approx. 3x the amount of SN you need.
5. Discard or put away the remaining curing salt. Retain the mixture that you got through boiling.
6. Add water into the mixture you have. Shake for 5 seconds. Uncap, then pour through coffee filter. Boil.
7. Repeat step 6 as many times as necessary.
8. Test the salts you get out of step 7! The salts remaining after these solubility tests should be only SN!

Method 2 - Melting
SN has a melting point of 271 °C, and decomposes at 320 °C. Salt (Sodium chloride) has a melting point of 810 °C.

Note: The yield on this is okay terrible, since there just isn't that much SN in curing salts.

Materials - Curing salt (lots) - A pan - Heating device, such as fire or hot plate, that can heat to 300 degrees C - Some sort of fine metal filter, that regular salt can't fit through - A flask or beaker, or a cup you won't ever use again - Thermometer that goes to 350 degrees C- SN test kit (You can get this from any pet store. You only need this if you want to test it.)

1. Put the curing salt onto the pan.
2. Put the pan on top of the heating device.
3. Turn on the heating device. DO NOT let the salt get hotter than 285 degrees C. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT let it get hotter than 300 degrees C since that's when it decomposes.
4. Once things start to melt, and you have enough fluids, pour the the melted contents through the filter.
5. Add water to the filtered contents and mix.
6. Boil out the water. You should get salts after boiling.
7. Test the salts! The salts remaining should be only SN!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. the amount of aluminium - you say '0.25 the mass of the amount of sodium nitRATE you are using as the reactants' does this mean a quarter of the mass of the sodium nitRATE? How do you calculate what the mass is? I assume it's different from the weight?
2. you say to keep it the temperature below 300C when heating the mixture, but don't actually specify what temperature you should aim for. Around 250C? Less?

I would buy 500mg so you have space to play with it, mess up, and make multiple attempts. Also the yield isn't that good.

Mass (basically) = weight (for our purposes). It would be a quarter of the amount of sodium nitrate.

There isn't a target temperature. I would keep it to be as hot as possible, but under 300 because over 300, it's ruined.

There are other ways to do it. I can write and publish another guide if for some reason I am able to stay long enough and not ctb before then. Alternatives include oxidizing lead (the industrial way), oxidizing hydrogen (very pure, since hydrogen with the extra 2 oxygen forms water), or with nitrous oxide and sodium hydroxide (which produces water as well). If you have chemistry experience I would recommend the nitrous oxide and sodium hydroxide method, but otherwise, I would do either the aluminium or the lead method.",2001112,2001205,2001476,2001135,,,,,,,,,

If you check your weight and you're under 100kg(I checked mine and it was eighty-something), 25g is the gold standard. But if you're over, 35g is advised lest you wake up the next morning wondering what went wrong. Since we're dealing with salts, just a gram could be the difference between vomiting and not vomiting so it's best to be accurate when you can. But Incase you do vomit, it'd be wise to have a backup cup.

A tablespoon is 14g(or 15g) and 15ml. So 2 tablespoons will be 28g which is a sweet spot between under and above 100kg. A lot of people go with that so as long as it is a scoop tablespoon and not heap dinner tablespoon, then sure, use it. Be sure to measure the water too, it should be as little as possible per cup, 50ml to 100ml(remember to stop drinking water 2hrs before SN, I think to not pee, not sure why). In my baking measuring spoons/cups package, there's a plastic cup that measures 60ml exact so I'll just use that for water.

Only thing left for me is gum and disposable cups. I hear some people use numbing mouth wash that makes them not taste the salt and hence not wanna vomit, I might have to look into that . Alright, lemme stop yapping",2648531,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can always create a plan to help yourself a bit.

Try doing some sports or going to the gym, you will get a better physique that might help you to feel more attractive.
Start a new course, there's plenty of paid and free courses online, plus you will learn a new skill.
Help others in need. You could volunteer in an animal shelter, that might give some purpose and meaning in your life.
Try getting the support you need, talk with a therapist. Maybe a good antidepressant could help.
There's plenty of free and paid games to distract you from negative thinking. Personally, I love League of Legends and Stardew Valley. Lague of Legends is a competitive game where you play with others and Stardew Valley is a cozy farming game with an immersive storyline. I can spend many hours just making a cup of cocoa and taking care of my crops/fishing and getting to know the storylines of other npc's
Remember that many people are going through a lot and life consists of ups and downs.
Stay away from social media, it's mostly fake.
Give yourself time and don't forget to put in some effort. Things will change only if you want them to change.

I'm not sure if I want to change really. I want to change myself not just because I'm depressed but because I'm just that kind of person that is really hard to love and understand.

unlovable,2646627,SanguineShark,"Aug 26, 2024 at 5:24 PM","I really can't imagine being loved. I spend so much time imagining various fantastical scenarios involving fictional characters that I create, yet imagining a person being head over heels in love with me is impossible, it's uncomfortably fake to the point I feel embarrassed to even think it could be a possible scenario. I see my friends being in loving relationships, being close to their partners, having someone who actively WANTS to be something more than friends with them and I feel sad and jealous that I will never have that. I have no lovable traits, there's nothing someone could love in me, I'm a worthless, ugly, annoying burden who's severely mentally ill and very autistic. I was never anything more than that all my life. I was in 3 relationships and in all of them I wasn't loved. First one happened too fast and we were more like friends than girlfriends, and I only heard ""I love you"" once. Second one happened wayy too fast too, and the person stopped saying they love me or even give any bit of affection after she saw me irl, because she realized she never actually loved me and was just obsessed with me as a friend. And the last one I was emotionally abused, being yelled at because my best wasn't ever good enough, I was a literal copy of their previous victims (anxious people pleasers), so what did she actually love about me? It feels more like she loved how she consciously or not knew I would be a perfect victim for her emotional abuse, someone she can train like a dog.
At this point I'm convinced I'm just unlovable as a person, and the only love I could ever get would have to also have abuse included. Honestly if I got a new girlfriend and she would physically abuse me or even sexually assault me, I would not leave her, because I'd know that's the only type of love I deserve.

Sometimes I wonder if they are all just messing with me and are actually laughing at how ugly and dumb I am behind their screens.

Seeing beautiful women just causes my feelings of hatred towards my appearance to get worse, sometimes to the point of wanting to kill myself. I think it's only worse thanks to social media further distorting my views of attractiveness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm going to ctb by partial hanging this week. My plan was to take a sedative (or just anything that would make me feel drowsy) and then hang myself after it kicked in. I'd be okay with some basic OTC shit, half a benadryl is enough to knock my weak ass out but i would probably take like 5 or something.

I was wondering if a sedative is even necessary.

my anxious venting and question about time (when should i take SN),2643199,busrider,"Aug 23, 2024 at 3:13 PM","just a regular venting, because I have an anxiety disorder and I am(wow who might think) ANXIOUS. I like to write everything in detail, because it's calming me, as if I write it, it will be like the script that my life will follow. My SN must arrive on the 27th with water, cups, test strips, weights and pipette. I have ordered not from some chemical company, but from a private person, but he attaches certificates and in any case I will check the purity. I do this only because the company's order starts from a few kilograms of SN, and I obviously don't need that much.

On the afternoon of the 29th my family will return from vacation, so I plan to get up this day at about 5:00-6:00, walk my dog, drink the necessary pills and then SN. My mother said that they leave around 9:00, I googled the tickets for this day (later I will just ask her the exact time), they should arrive in Moscow at about 12:30. The drive home will take 3 more maximum 4 hours, that is, around 16:00 they will be home. so I will have about 9 hours after the SN AND before their appearance.

I really don't want to make them worry while flight and on the way home. but they will definitely be worried at least because I won't answer their messages. It is ok if I don't answer at 9:00 when they're just getting on the plane because we don't walk our dog in the morning, he likes to sleep too, we only walk at 12:00 and in the evening, which means I have to wake up by their time of landing in Moscow at 12:30 and text back.

as an option I can take the SN after their landing, but that means I have less than 4 hours before they arrive. The guide said that death occurs within 40 minutes - 4 hours. I'm just scared that I might need all 4 hours (anxiety disorder AGAIN).

I don't know, it's driving me crazy. That's all I can think about. I want to finish this ASAP, but at the same time I do not want to disturb them while their homecoming. I mean, they'll be incredibly sad when they find me, but still. AGHHHH

The more I think about it, the more scary it gets to me. For the last year, I've been thinking about death every EVERY GODDAMN day. I originally thought about partial or full hanging, but I'm very afraid of pain (even if it will only last a minute or two until I lose consciousness), then, looking at different resources, I learned about the method with inert gases, In search of information I went to this site and then learned about SN, which still seems the most optimal in my conditions. Even after numerous posts where people in their last minutes saying (writing) that they felt only a slight discomfort or people who was saved said it was absolutely peaceful, something keep scaring me. It's the same feeling I get when I have to give a talk in front of my study group. the same way I felt every time I went to meet my friends. when I needed to make a call. fucking anxiety.

I know that I just need to take the SN and in 10-20 minutes I'll lose consciousness, and in 40-4 hours it will finally be over. but I'm still scared.

I'm writing this because I don't even have anyone to share it with. I only have a few friends left, but I can't write them like hey, I'm worried because in a week I'm going to CTB, could you please help me to calm down? hah

I will be glad to get any message under this post so I will know that at least someone has read it and I am not alone.

What do you think about the time of taking SN? final decision will still be mine, but I am interested in your opinion
1) take the SN early in the morning (or maybe when they get on the plane; before that wish them a good flight), but then my family will worry all the way home from the airport.
2) take the SN when they already land, but then I will have about 4 hours before their return.

I am so worried about these 4 hours because there is probably some correlation between the weight of the person and the speed of SN action, I am 162 cm and weigh 80 kg (5' 3 and 12st 8lb).",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Questions about Propranolol,2618616,sleepingrabbit,"Aug 3, 2024 at 12:18 PM","(Hi! I'm new here, so if this breaks any rules pls tell me.)

I don't have access to SN and my mother is able to see my purchase history. I'm not sure how often she looks at it but I don't want to risk it. I've thought of trying to hide it amongst other purchases but I'm not sure if I want to risk having to have that conversation.

I do however have a lot of propranolol. I'm not completely sure how much would be needed for it to be considered lethal. I have 10mg tablets, for reference. I also have a few other medications that I've gathered over time, like cyproheptadine and buspirone. If anyone knows a good dosage for using propranolol as the main ingredient that would be very helpful. As well as how well it dissolves into water. I already have an idea due to some of my own research and tests, but I just want to confirm that I'm right.

I'm running out of time since one of my stockpiled bottles expires in December and I'm not sure how much longer I can do this for. I don't want to make an attempt at CTB only for it to fail because I underdosed and end up with heart issues because of it, but at this point I might just take whatever I can get my hands on and say screw it to my more careful plans.

It seems quite common for fishermen to accidentally touch the high voltage cables with their fishing rods (in fact, I imagine that touching them is the wet fishing wire).

The carbon fiber fishing rods, then, seem to be the best for electric transmission.

I don't know if this developed because of my past traumas and high exposure to porn media back when I was very young, but these thoughts have plagued me for years, even before puberty.

It's not only attraction, these thoughts and images of me doing these terrible things to Innocent people. And sometimes, I even catch myself enjoying them like the sicko I am

Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't ever do these things to anyone in real life, but I just had to take this off my chest. I've been told off by many because of my weird sexual tastes since I was born a woman, so I never had the chance to even hint to anyone of my sick thoughts",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lots of people think OCD is about tidy and clean but sexual OCD is very real.
Also anxiety and sexual arousal can share brain pathways. Your body can not always tell difference from fear and excitement arousal. So you may not actually enjoy like you think.
And even if you do enjoy thoughts as long as don't act or watch CP they you not harming. You are not alone with this and if you want help with it , there is help out there.

If you exhibit symptoms of OCD without much of the physical compulsions, it may be Pure O OCD. My therapist strongly recommends Pure O OCD: Letting Go of Obsessive Thoughts with Acceptance and Commitment Therapy by Chad LeJeune PhD.

In regards to POCD, there is Unshackle from POCD by Dr. Sunil Punjabi. I haven't read this specific book, but Dr. Punjabi is a specialist in ERP, and I know someone with OCD who strongly recommends his Overcoming OCD series. He also will be releasing a book about sexual intrusive thoughts with OCD sometime in the future.

It's not specific to POCD, but the workbook that friend uses is The OCD Workbook: Your Guide to Breaking Free from Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder by Bruce Hyman PhD & Cherry Pedrick RN.

For generalized sexual intrusive thoughts there is Sexual OCD Recovery by Ali Greymond.

It's hard to recommend books about sexual trauma without knowing the circumstances. I won't ask for details. However I will provide this list from Columbia University that I think is a good starting point for many different walks of life. My favorites from the list are Dear Sister: Letters from Survivors of Sexual Violence and I Never Told Anyone - Writings by Women Survivors of Child Sexual Abuse.

In general, people make pedophiles out to be monsters for the mere fact of their attraction to children. However, it's not your choice and so it's not fair to make any moral judgement about you for it. There is a world of difference between you and someone who actually abuses kids.

Also, people who tell you to kill yourself for being a pedophile are ignorant and you should try to not let them bother you. They confuse ""pedophile"" with ""child-molester"". They don't understand the struggle.

I don't know how things are where you live, but from my experience therapists/support groups/etc. generally won't lock you up unless they believe there to be some imminent danger to you or others. Simply discussing your thoughts (no matter how horrible) shouldn't be enough for that. However, things might be different where you're from.

I've labelled up documents for the horses so people will know who's who and where they are.

I've got lots of technical text books and some obscure ones. I'm not sure whether to inventory these and/or sorr them into piles so they'll be easier for people to get rid of.

I've got alot of craft stuff that was used to make stock for the shop, I was using it up so that there would be stuff for family to sell, now I'm wondering whether to do that or just sell the materials.

I'm trying to do 6months worth of work for work in 6 weeks so I don't leave them in the lurch any more than I will inevitably will.

What am I missing? Is there something else I should be doing? I've not written my letters yet, I need to send some of them to public authorities in the hope they might save someone else from the vendetta I've been subject to.

3 months ago I successfully bought a gram of fentanyl powder.
somehow in the following time I lost .4 grams (400 milligrams) ik cause they came in individual packaging 100mg each.

However I still have around 600 mg left. My method is to inject this in multiple syringe-fulls in my thigh by IM (intramuscular injection)
I dumped all I had left into this container, then boiled about 3 spoonfuls of filtered water. I then dumped each spoonful into the container. the boiled water mostly mixed it and gave it this color.
But what I am concerned about is how little this amount seems. I have 8 3ml 23gauge 1 inch syringes which is the size intended for IM.
I measured the best I could, the water + F in the jar should be at least 4-5ml.

Am I being stupid, or is this not enough somehow? (about 600mg of fent powder dissolved in 3 spoonfuls of boiled water)

that's good to hear. silly I was first worried about the volume of it then got concerned if enough was in there. if it was the lowest possible purity (10%, it has cutting agents) 600mg = ~60mg but I believe that's still more than enough even in a small amount of ML.",2610302,2610227,,,,,,,,,,,

My own thoughts on the failures of the MH system,2644067,KuriGohan&Kamehameha,"Aug 24, 2024 at 1:08 PM","A huge reason why I believe my suicidality has persisted for over half my life is because the stringent, regulation-bound, trigger happy mental healthcare system completely failed me when I was an impressionable child who didn't get a choice to walk away from it when things weren't working for me. As an adult, interacting with the MH system in any capacity fills me with a deep sense of unease, puts me on high-alert, and further embeds a proclivity for distrust within me.

Now, these are my own experiences, and I don't want to dissuade anyone by sharing them. I have known people who felt supported by MH services. I just am not one of them. And there's really no other space in which I can share that, it's an incredibly isolating perspective to hold as healthcare institutions are ironclad against any sort of criticism and refuse to adapt to the needs of what are considered ""problem cases.""

In some aspects, I am luckier than others. I was never detained in a psychiatric ward, or sectioned, but I came within a hair's breath of that happening several times, and I witnessed a relative being detained for suicidality before, as well as losing a friend to suicide following a horrific involuntary hospitalisation. For a long time every occasion I'd hear a random knock at the door or an ambulance siren I'd jump out of my skin and panic because I thought once again I'd have to talk my way out of getting forced into something incredibly damaging for me and downplay how much I'm suffering in terms of suicidal thoughts so they don't force me into what is effectively a prison sentence rather than any sort of rehabilitation.

For people like myself, the MH services and modalities of treatment are not only ineffective and ill suited for purpose, but can cause more damage if they are continuously forced once it's been established such methods aren't having a positive effect. The worst part about this is having almost no one believe it, and having to contend with accusations that you don't want to put in the work and similar types of rhetoric. It can never be the case that certain methodologies, pills, and therapies are not suited to you, no, it is always a personal failing according to that logic, something which angers me to no end.

I remember bits and pieces of being a struggling adolescent and teenager. Looking back, what I truly needed during that time was a caring figure and a role model, as well as good relationships with other people who were knowledgeable about autism and could have treated me with kindness and patience. In hindsight, that crucial period was a time to build skills, relationships, and the foundations for a good life, but the adults responsible for nurturing that allowed me to sink.

Instead, I was put on a cocktail of medications and sent to therapy, where I was basically told I had to just continue to deal with my family's neglect until I became an adult, because they can't do anything unless my family started physically beating me in a noticeable manner. Instead of suggesting anything tangible to remedy the situation, I was told that I needed to use coping mechanisms like listening to music and drawing when my relatives were having shouting matches, breaking everything in the house, or refusing to acknowledge my presence for 3 days straight when I was still a child and dependent on them for survival.

The issue during that period was primarily my environment, with my PTSD and autism being secondary drivers that were inhibiting my ability to flourish and have a good life. Because I wasn't given any accomodation or disability support at school, I was held to the same standard as other pupils and would be taken into rooms and berated and insulted frequently by teachers as they thought I was lazy and being stupid on purpose when I was drugged out of my mind on psychiatric medications and not even eating more than one meal a day because my foster parents wouldn't buy enough food. There was a point where I was basically homeless while still in highschool, sleeping on the sofa bed of a girl I met online and working 7 hours a day many days on top of attending school, but that was never taken into consideration. Nope, I was simply ""mentally ill and lazy.""

I've had probably a dozen different therapists assigned to my case throughout my life time, and none of them have ever told me something I didn't already know, or been able to offer me anything genuinely useful. Probably the worst fumble dealt to me by a therapist was one of them not objecting to a 26 year old man grooming me when I was 16/17 to prime me to have sex with him and end up living with him because I had nowhere else to go. What I really needed to be told was that what was happening to me was messed up and innapropriate. I feel sick to my stomach recollecting any of this.

I've had PTSD since a very young age and it has not responded to any sort of psychotherapy or psychiatric treatment, I think the damage is deeply embedded at this point but that observation seems to go in one ear and out the other when it comes to MH workers. A sentiment I've often seen reflected on this site, and in my own life, is that there's no room for honesty when dealing with MH staff. If you admit how suicidal you are, it can put you at risk of institutionalisation. Sometimes, you can pour your heart out about what's troubling you and be met with blank eyed stares, or statements that demonstrate your burdens are too weighty for them to handle. The lack of understanding breeds more pain and resentment.

Other people would tell me, I just haven't found the ""right"" therapist or doctor and whatnot, despite going to so many different ones, and then later living under a system where the only option is paying out of pocket for private therapists as the national health service won't provide you with a pittance of anything. So in my case, it would be throwing money down the drain and gambling, as there are very few therapists or MH staff who have experience with extensive childhood trauma in the first place, a conclusion made not only by myself but the numerous MH staff I interacted with throughout my life. I was always told I needed a higher standard of care, but this higher standard did not exist.

Spending a lot of time online reading forums where clinicians interact and only verified MH staff are allowed to post (so it's quite legit), I have observed that psychiatrists and therapists both express resentment and hatred towards patients who cannot simply fix themselves. I have frequently seen psychiatrists discouraging each other from working in ""complex"" populations as they admit there's nothing you can do for certain patients, but they aren't allowed to say this to the person's face as it's part for parcel that they have to instill hope no matter what.

I genuinely think a sizable number of people working in the mental health field have no clue what they're doing when it comes to many issues. I've met so many healthcare staff who do not keep up with current research, who lack critical thinking skills especially when it comes to prescribing medications which contradict, and genuinely cannot make informed clinical decisions based on a patient's best interest because all they can do is follow tick box guidelines to try and dodge all liability. It's very frustrating because these valid criticisms are viewed as, ""resistance to treatment"" or irrational thinking rather than real issues that need to be addressed in order for the field to ever improve.

When you're labeled as ""mentally ill' in any capacity, you're assumed to have no theory of mind or insight when it's convenient for the argument being put forward. A person could have a very rational reason behind how they feel, for example, a person who has always been alone predicting that they will continue to feel lonesome if nothing changes in their life is a logical judgement based on past experiences and current evidence. In this circumstance, that loneliness should be acknowledged in an attempt to find solutions to remedy it, but often in the mental health world, bad feelings are often treated like cognitive distortions no matter what. Another example I can think of is telling someone to feel less stress while not removing any of the stressors causing such pressure in the first place. There's a cause and effect that goes unheard. How can one solve the underlying problem if it is never acknowledged in the first place?

It's why I find so many MH treatments glaringly ineffective. It's like throwing darts blindly at a dartboard and hoping you land the bullseye. I remember being taught in my degree that SSRIs, for example, were not as effective as they are advertised, especially when you consider that many types of serotonin receptors are not even fully understood yet. Many are still being discovered far after these drugs hit the market. From a drug design perspective as well, one has to consider the question, is it beneficial to have a global effect on one type of target (serotonin transporter), without consideration of specific brain regions to reduce the risk of offshoot effects? There are so many questions like this which MH staff cannot often answer. These questions aren't being studied.

Recently, I dealt with the MH system again as I had to prove I was seeking some sort of support in order for the impacts of my health circumstances to be validated. Both encounters left me feeling worse and even more hopeless, I think upon being confronted with the knowledge that no one is going to give you novel information or suggestions it reinforces a sense of despair. Every time I deal with MH services it feels like I am not being heard at all. One MH worker told me a few months ago that it was a good thing in a way that I've been suicidal for over half of my life, because it has taught me how to ""cope"" with it instead of going through with the act. The underlying wickedness of forcing someone to suffer and seeing that continued pain through a positive lens just demonstrates a complete lack of insight into how awful being suicidal is.

Often times the messaging is, they are doing the best that they can with the tools that are available. In some situations, this may be true. There are some MH staff who went into this line of work with altruistic motives and truly want to help. But I don't agree with it regarding the MH field as a whole for a number of reasons. When it comes to other facets of health, the public generally agrees that medicine needs to be improved, and you will see donation calls for research funding everywhere for other sorts of diseases. Yet, when discussing 'mental' despair, developmental disabilities, and other neurological issues that can't be easily seen with the naked eye or dealt with by other medical specialties, suffering is perceived as a case of personal responsibility.

MH staff seem to resent treatment resistant patients and treat them badly in ways that would be unacceptable in other fields. ""Go to therapy"" has become a dog whistle insult for people you don't want to deal with or dislike. No matter how much people will say they want to erase stigma, there is a bias everywhere that can't be erased, and it is how people treat others with long-term, incurable mental health issues and think they exist of a person's own violition.

Even on here at times, I have seen people say that someone else simply needs to improve their personality, outlook, etc. I think certain aspects of one's temperament can be moulded and shaped over time, but it's completely unrealistic to expect grown adults to rewire years of formative experience and conceptions about the world that have been strengthened with time- a very fundamental principle of how synaptic plasticity works in the brain- using sheer willpower alone.

The reality is that the adult brain is incredibly difficult to mould compared to an adolescent one, and we need better methods of facilitating that. Telling someone to get over it or change their entire personhood to become more happy and appealing is simply at odds with the complexity of the human mind and what's required to initiate a biological change. Many cognitive symptoms are caused by underlying physical pathologies in other parts of the body, but this fact is neglected and often dismissed. I didn't reach the low point I'm at now without suffering from chronic fatigue for years and developing spinal pain that makes it difficult to function consistently. Yet, that aspect is ignored entirely.

Then there are also societal aspects as well, suffering is more often than not treated like an individual burden, when support from others is a key component of emotional wellbeing and stability. For whatever reason it has become completely normalized for large chunks of the population to live alone, to never leave their house, to exist almost fully online, and to be fully self reliant. A lot of human biology has not adapted to this yet. Elders die unattended in their homes, people cry out about loneliness and yet as always this is treated as an individual failing and not an error in collective consciousness and culture enabling this depressing state of affairs to happen.

A few weeks ago I complained to a therapist that there are not enough outlets for socialising post university for adults especially if you lack family support. They told me to just find groups and join them. The groups do not exist. Not only the support groups, but any sort of hobby group that does not involve high intensity sports does not exist unless you live in a metropolitan area. Even then, you could attend a group numerous times and nothing may come out of it as attendance of members may be inconsistent and people are nomadic and moving around a lot rather than staying in one location long enough for meaningful connections to form. When I point out the lack of groups to join, I'm told to just talk to strangers in the park, when that is deeply frowned upon culturally where I live to disturb people in supermarkets, parks, etc. You can't win in this scenario because they will always loop it back to finding fault with something you're doing, or not.

MH workers have made so many assumptions about me and others that they will not allow you to challenge. One thing I've been told so many times is, it's not acceptable to have a low dose of sedatives in rare situations for PTSD, you should be forced to confront triggers, no more crutches. The MH industry cannot seem to acknowledge that some people cannot ""process trauma"" by talking about it, and that some people will always be bothered by certain things no matter how many times you brute force them to confront those stimuli. What's even worse is that the most efficacious methods for helping people with PTSD (compounds like MDMA which stimulates a remarkable state of neuroplasticity) are completely off limits and will continue to be for the foreseeable future to 99.9% of the people who need hope the most.

The mental health system has made me feel more suicidal and hopeless, and I wish that it could be acknowledged outside of this forum that situations like mine do happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
My own thoughts on the failures of the MH system,2644098,Priestess,"Aug 24, 2024 at 1:44 PM","You're right. I've had 5 therapies and 5 antidepressants. None worked and several had appalling side effects. I've had severe depression for over 25 years, one suicide attempt already, a history of self harm and a major eating disorder (started off as anorexia for a few years then turned into bulimia). Here are some examples of the therapy I've been given on the NHS:

One therapist was a hippie who told me to buy the New Age book, ""The Secret,"" about the law of attraction, and use the law of attraction to attract whatever I want into my life, then I won't need to be depressed any more.

One therapist suggested this to cure my lifelong eating disorder: that I should write a list of all the reasons I should eat normally and then look at it whenever I want to starve or binge I should look at the list and just eat normally.

My current therapist is obsessed with making me write timetables for myself. Depressed? Anxious? Eating disorder? Just write a healthy daily timetable for yourself and stick to it! Never mind any real help. I'm living in an abusive situation right now and every week she promises to find some resources for me to find a better living situation and every week she forgets to do it. And ALL of these therapists blamed me when these ""therapies"" and antidepressants didn't work.

As you say, telling people to feel less stressed while doing nothing to get rid of the source of the stress is a big one. My current therapist actually said to me this week that her objective with this therapy is just to get me to accept my situation and learn to live with the stress. Why am I still having this therapy? One reason only: I'm going through a PIP reassessment right now and if I'm not in treatment they'll likely stop my payments. As soon as I get my award, I'm quitting (unless I can ctb before then).

Like you, I was blamed as a problem child during my youth. I was actually an abused and neglected child, but no adult even thought to ask if some deeper issue was going on. They just blamed me.

Same thing with my physical health. I was ill for three and a half years. No doctor would do tests and my parents wouldn't advocate for me. They all just called me a lazy hypochondriac. Later turned out I actually had thyroid cancer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would totally understand proceeding with suicide asap if that is on the table. To hell with the malicious and vile normie retards.

Edit.
Now this hits close to home. (Although I'm Ukrainian, and you're probably talking about America, and I may be applying American standards to the Ukraine.) I feel like without the clan systems of Asia, or without the totalitarian party system of the deceased USSR, all we can do is die unattended indeed. Maybe women have it better due to the ease of forming a relationship, but men should just die.

Are people suddenly way happier these days because of the availability of therapy and meds? It doesn't seem like it.

Also, convincing people that they are inherently defective rather than helping them solve their underlying problems just sets them on a path toward failure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
My own thoughts on the failures of the MH system,2646279,KuriGohan&Kamehameha,"Aug 26, 2024 at 12:05 PM","I hope you're feeling a bit better now, with your thyroid, and have been able to stay in remission. Having your hormones messed with is no joke, especially if it's being caused by cancer/tumors. And we all know the NHS doesn't really often do their duty of care to check in on people with health conditions that can relapse.

I had a huge tumor (that turned out to be non-cancerous in the end) removed myself from my reproductive organs over a year ago. It took years for me to find out I had a massive tumor in the first place until it completely stopped me from being unable to use the bathroom anymore because it was blocking so many organs. Doctors said many times I was just not exercising enough, lazy, anxious, or not eating enough fiber. Even now I still bleed occasionally and have lots of pain in that area and I was told it's likely I'll end up with more tumors eventually but if I have my ovaries removed I'd need to take synthetic hormones forever. Such great healthcare.

It must be so frustrating that you have to keep going to something that isn't useful and productive for you, in order to be able to retain the benefits you need to sustain yourself. I think the people who make the regulations don't realize how useless ""treatment"" can be or even more damaging in certain situations. They just assume everything can be fixed if you just keep going to professionals enough times.

Forcing people to accept messed up situations has never sit right with me. I've been told similar things many times before. With my chronic health problems, I've been told that I need to just ""accept that this is the way life is now."" Rather than being offered anything that might actually remedy any of my symptoms somewhat. I've spent ages trying off label treatments I bought online because they literally will not do anything for me anymore and gave up. It's disheartening to be told that we have to accept bad situations, over, and over, and over again. And yet they want us to have hope?? How??

If they don't give you any information about housing resources soon you may have to push the council/social services. I've been through the same rigamarole when it comes to referrals, no joke I've been told multiple times over the span of many months that I would be referred to a number of services which ended up not existing. Each time I would go back and probe again only for them to have forgotten or pretend they never mentioned it and push talkworks again. You deserve better than this crap too. We all deserve better.


Agree with all of this 100%, especially how these systems convinced many people that we are defective and unworthy of having a place in this world, whilst expecting us to just be happy and content with such a harsh judgement call.

While I know not everyone's pain can be absolved with love/positive attention, looking back on my adolescence the difference in how things turned out would have been night and day if I'd had any sort of positive reinforcement and encouragement as opposed to vitriol and being labeled as a lost cause and a ""mentally ill lazy loser"" while suffering from the effects of a traumatic childhood.

I noticed that in school especially, at a certain point all the adults would give up on certain children and decide that they were not worth investing in, even at an early age. How morally bankrupt is that, before children are even self aware that adults are putting a scarlett letter on the next generation and giving up on helping them because they had a bad home life, learning disabilities, or certain behavioural issues.

From what I've noticed it seems like more and more normal people with more common complaints are using MH services now. By normal I mean someone who wouldn't qualify as having dehabiliating illnesses that impair their ability to function and exist in a noticeable way. I've seen on social media people paying for therapy as a weekly vent session to air the stressors of everyday life rather than what we would consider pathological levels of distress/pain, and it seems to be becoming more common.

I think this gives the illusion that these techniques and methods are more effective than they actually are. When the user base is saturated with a ton of people it's easier to pretend that the success rate is high because the effects in certain demographics are being obscufated. No matter what someone's issue is these days they're always going to be referred to the same generic therapy regardless.

While I have seen some people be helped by methods that I find ineffective for myself, I've also seen many people who on the surface would say they're stable, coping with SSRIs therapy etc being one bad day away from a total breakdown and feeling like their current state is being held together with duck tape. I've known people online who are on the gamut of weed, psych meds, and weekly therapy and still not very happy.

I think the lack of options makes people feel afraid to acknowledge that the tools we have available need to be seriously refined.",2644098,2644177,,,,,,,,,,,

I have essentially the same experience and outlook on it as you except I experienced the coercive side of things (not just narrowly escaped it but that's certainly traumatizing itself as well).

That's why suicide appeals to me. Being able to exercise your agency in the most ultimate way after a lifetime of not being able to. Not just in terms of coercive psychiatry but that certainly was a big theme.

You already know, I'm sure regulars already know, so I won't repeat myself here.

I have ADHD and for my whole life up until recently, I wasn't even aware it effected my mood. Because my DOCTORS weren't aware. They have known I've had ADHD since the 4th grade, but only advised that focus and hyperactivity are effected. It is soooo much more than that. And now that I know that information, it is even more depressing because I have to teach doctors that when I go to the appointment. Even ones who specialize in ADHD don't always know about executive functions and emotional regulation.

I've learned more about it and it makes so much sense to me now why I have so many sensory sensitivities and issues with food textures. It also makes sense as to why I struggle so much socially. but it really doesn't make anything better because no one has found any real solutions to this issue. The medications barely do anything and maybe just give me the ability to mask.

I am estranged from my family and live in a metropolitan area, but it is impossible to find groups to do anything! I've tried to find 2nd spaces (it is normally 3rd but I WFH so my work and home are only 1 space) through cafes, pickleball groups, hiking groups, volunteering, etc. and I haven't found any consistent community. I feel like the MH system is so behind, they can't help me. They have always minimized my issues, ""there is nothing wrong with your life, why are you upset?"" and made me feel like a criminal for wanting to escape this hell.

It's the stigma that makes you believe you're a failure. But the stigma is bred out of a lack of understanding and people's inability to face this level of darkness.

I wish I could remember what exactly they said and how they said it. But whatever it was, it immediately changed my way of thinking on this subject, and that definitely would not have been an easy thing to do.

It's such a complicated subject, looking at the ways of our society and the impacts it has on people of different personalities, different vulnerabilities, different environments, different genetics, different backgrounds, different cultures, etc.

Look at how insanely active this forum is. What does it say about the world and our way of life that this would be such a popular place to come to?

They're so quick to dismiss us as broken losers. It's the easy, convenient (non)solution. It would be so much harder for society to actually stare the darkness in the face, confront it, and actually do something about it to better everyone's lives and give people better opportunities to recover and improve our general way of life and make it less likely for people to fall down the cracks in the first place.

We can only do the best we can with what we've been given, and it doesn't help when forces and events not in our control keep piling on top of us more and more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Society, most people, families etc. don't like to have difficult, complicated conversations and truly ""see"" and look around them, they are hung up on themselves and if they are getting by then that's about all they are currently wired in their consciousness to do or pay attention to. It takes a very special person and someone whose already had very difficult experiences, to step outside of themselves and everyday reality to truly ""see"" what is going on around them and within themselves and try to make sense of why things are they way they are and what it means, such as why these issues and this forum exist.

The problem lies with the collective.

I don't blame the individual. Most neurotypicals are also suffering or struggling in their own ways, and a lot of that is a byproduct of our short-sighted way of life (ironically many of the same root problems as the suicidally-inclined).

Yes, they (we) are all responsible for their (our) own actions. But I guess what I mean is that I wouldn't look at the problems of the ""bigger picture"" and attribute those problems to any individual person.

getting out of choises...,2647155,rotting,"Aug 27, 2024 at 4:02 AM","i want to ask what you guys think about my current situation.

the doctors told me there's nothing else they can do. i'm on meds for a year now, but i've been treating this depression since forever.

nowadays i'm taking venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, bupropion and quetiapine.

the psychiatrist told me i'm on the highest dose in each one of them, so he can't increase it. what he can do is change the meds, but he told me, with his words: ""it will not change a thing"".

yesterday i had an appointment with my therapist, but i decided i'm not going anymore, and i also won't come back to the psychiatrist.
i've decided to keep taking the meds until they end and never buy them anymore.

ok, the thing here is, the last time i didn't took them, i felt like i could kill myself easily. because without the meds i literally have 0 serotonin, etc.

after reading this, you guys think there's another option for me? fr, i can't handle anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

My near death experience as a child,2648741,Surai,"Aug 28, 2024 at 11:20 AM","My parents had gotten one of thise inflatable circular pools that were maybe 2 feet in height. Well this pool would be used almost everyday and we had little inflatable animals to hold on to and life vest floaties. Well one day I decided to just climb in the pool when my parents were inside. the pool was the backyard and the sliding door was glass and was surrounded by windows so you could easily see through to who was in the pool. Anyways I climbed in there and would just hold ontu the ledge. on my tiptoes I was able to keep my head above the water. I was geeting board of just standing so I looked behing me and saw one of infatable animals (the turtle) and decided I was going to reach for it. I reached for it and since bottom of these pools tend to be slippery I slipped and fell under. I feel into criss cross positon on my butt. I first tried getting up but each time I would try to get up my feet couldnt get any traction and would slip from under me. and I would fall back on my butt. In the initial drop I was panicking trying to get up again and again trying to get traction I even tried climbing up the wall of the pool but that proved usless. I actually gave up. But this is when this moment stuck withbme. After some time which felt like forever. I began to clam down. I calmed down so much I wasnt even panicking. I swear I felt some sort of peace like my body was accepting it. I looked up and even reminisced on the dead bugs that lay itself across the surface of the pool because we woudlnt even cover it at night. I felt a peace like I was good right here, I was good, no in fact I dont want to get try getting up again and I just sat there at the bottom of this pool. And then maybe my mom knew I was out in the backyard but couldnt see me so she knew the last place to check. So I see this hand come into the water reaching for me to grab on. And I swear I remeber all of this vividely I hesitated grabing that hand because I had gotten so calm and peaceful just sitting at the bottom of the pool. It was a moment then I grabbed her hand and my mom pulled me out of the pool with one arm I practicully flew out and I started couphing like crazy.

Now I just want to feel that peacefull feeling I had felt It was a serene calm",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've given up for today. I really thought today would be the day. I was a lot calmer than my first attempt, everything was ready. I would've been successful if not for that stupid SI.

Firstly, SI is so annoying. I thought it came from immense fear of death, but this time I noticed it was my body quite literally moving on its one seemingly without reason. I wouldn't say I didn't have control of my body, but it's against my will. It's really annoying.

Secondly, my mind itself is very clear this time. My first attempt, I was really scared after doing it once, and quit straight after. This time, except for the few seconds after standing back up and blood rushes to my brain, my mind was not hazy at all. I just kept trying again and again. I took a few breaks in between, of course. After a certain point I seriously just got annoyed of the whole thing, I wasn't even sad or scared anymore. I even changed the song from a sad song to a more pumped up one trying to motivate myself halfway thtough.

Just mad now. Now I'm going to get less sleep and I'll be tired tomorrow. Annoying.

Could benzos cause failure when taking SN?,2648397,MountainMan99,"Aug 28, 2024 at 4:41 AM","Hello everyone.

I have a question, the PPH suggests taking benzos after ingesting the SN drink, in order to make the user become unconscious so he doesn't feel the discomfort SN will cause, right?

But i have been thinking there might be an issue with that, since people here recommend preparing 2 SN drinks in 2 different cups, in case we vomit the 1st one, what if we become unconscious because of the benzos drink, and then we vomit while unconscious and because of that we are unable to drink the 2nd SN cup, wouldn't that probably increase the risk of failure?

This make me uncertain of whether i should or not take the benzos, because yes, i do want for the process to be as painless as possible, but i don't want to fail..

I have seen vizzy's thread where he also said he took benzos..

So i am confused on what to do..

Do you guys have any suggestions? Thank you!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Could benzos cause failure when taking SN?,2648532,Catch-22,"Aug 28, 2024 at 8:09 AM","It's almost like you read my post I'm glad people are starting to think of these things because many don't. It depends on what type of benzo you are going to use some are fast, intermediate, or slow onset. It also depends on what experience you have with benzos. A couple beforehand is one thing but to take the large amount that the PPH suggest to take right after your first cup of SN I think someone should think long and hard about that decision. I know the one that they suggest is slow onset so maybe that's why also the fact that you may end up vomiting a large amount of it out of your system. However, I decided to try to hold out as long as possible after drinking my first cup of SN... so I would be awake if I vomit and I can drink my second cup. The type I've benzo I will be using is very fast onset.. I think even when people take an anti-emetic they tend to vomit . I plan to take Metro",2648397,,,,,,,,,,,,

Who is a NEET ?,2647414,Grumble,"Aug 27, 2024 at 9:14 AM","I would suggest going with ""think neutral"" instead.

Negative: ""I'm a hopeless NEET.""
Positive: ""Life is great.""
Neutral: ""I'm neither employed, nor in education.""

Negative and positive thinking are associated with judgements (opinions). It's these judgements that lead to our feelings and emotions. Neutral is ""just the facts"". When you want to get away from negative thinking, try stripping the opinion out of the problem thoughts.

Actually, it would be even better to take it a step further. Ideally, the neutral thoughts are without any negative words.

Neutral: ""I'm neither employed, nor in education.""
Neutral, without negatives: ""I'm finished with schooling, and I can look at employment options if/when I'm ready.""

If you can ""think positive"" and believe it, that might be better, but belief is the key. In order to buy into it, you need to believe it. You won't always believe positive thinking, but you'll always believe an objective fact, so neutral is the go-to strategy in countering negative thinking.",2647210,2647212,,,,,,,,,,,

But even tho she rejected me the feelings haven't disappeared, and i told her that yesterday. And for the first time i think I've lost her trust. She was so disappointed with me. And she thinks we ought to have time apart, indefinitely. She didn't come in to work today and i worry it was my fault, even tho there are many other reasons why she wouldn't. I miss her and I hate myself for ruining the only reliable, deep friendship I have. I feel alone. I don't want to hurt her more by reaching out but i miss her, I feel like I need her… i know it's unhealthy. I just don't know what to do. im worried about her also coz she has a history of mental problems worse than mine. All because i had to fall for her. If i could castrate myself emotionally… never caused me anything but pain. I dont want to want anything anymore because i will just stay yearning for the rest of my life and thats not a life i can handle.

Existential thoughts about suffering and existence.,2645096,Circles,"Aug 25, 2024 at 11:24 AM","Have you ever wondered why we exist? Of course most humans have. But have ever wondered more about why things are exactly the way they are? That you have to just somehow go through an experience we call life that we didn't ask to be born into and yet we are faced with an uncontrollable situation we all find ourselves in. I often ask to myself why is it that I am me, of all the possibilities I'm in this body typing this out in this time and space, part of a certain species, culture, etc, that we're all on a random ball we call earth that is hurdling through the void with no reason to explain as to why we are here let alone why suffering has to exist.

I often think about suicide in history. Most people who have ever killed themselves throughout history their own names, memories and struggles are lost forever in the midst of time. Most if not all suicides are forgotten and something about that just feels indescribably wrong and unsettling. To know all those peoples suffering and death can be swept under a rug as if it none of our pain existed. And it goes for non suicidal people as well. All our suffering ultimately means nothing and despite that complete utter indifference the universe shows our pain means everything to us. How would you feel if the universe told you that all your suffering is pointless and senseless and there was no need for any of it?

All existential questions all basically boils down to 'Welp that just how the universe is' as if that's good enough. And even if there was an explanation as to why suffering exists it probably wouldn't be a satisfactory answer. Cause to those reading this feeling some sort of pain surely can understand. Out of everything that bothers me most about life is that feeling that your pain and suffering is ultimately for nothing despite it being everything to us. Something about this just feels overwhelmingly indescribably sickening.

To this end suicide is a conundrum. Thinking about how a complete nobody who never asked to exist has to face the reality of suicide just to end the senseless suffering in an inexplicable nightmare that is life just to want to return to an even more unexplainable nothingness if it's even that at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Existential thoughts about suffering and existence.,2645129,justamirror,"Aug 25, 2024 at 12:06 PM","What if it is for something?? I have a hard time accepting the whole pointless nothing matters we all die argument. I feel like people let their ideas get stuck into a box where there are no other possibilities. We are in this reality on this planet in this space. Like WTF? Everything we see is just signals interpreted by our brains inside our heads what we see is inside our heads... And what we interpret is severely limited to what is going on. These bodies to me clearly were built to survive, continue to change (like everything around us is doing), and reproduce. Our brains were built to serve that function! Did you know you can cut someone's brain in half and each hemisphere processes information independently.

Have you heard of the double slit experiment (from 1800s btw) where we see that photons act as a wave naturally - we get a obvious wave interference pattern when passed through two slits and onto a background. But when we go to observe this in action with machines made to enhance and upgrade our senses that pattern disappears and we only get the particle form of the photon appearing and passing through the slit - like the universe doesn't want to be found. There is a mold called slime mold a brainless goo that has been used to map the cosmic web.

Did you know there is a field called the higgs boson that is being explained as this thing that is everywhere and its what gives particles mass (expect photon and one other) and we think at any time randomly this field will become unstable and we all will just disappear. WTF is up with the super massive blackholes at the center of every galaxy wat da fuq. When we look out we see the past the photons that have reached us at the moment not the present. How did life emerge from the lifeless - one of the biggest questions of this world imo.

We have such a limited possibility of understanding what this place is. Your a result of billions of years. change after change after change. We all are apart of this thing that is changing. We are it ... and to just sum it up to well its all pointless is so bizarre to me. There are some 30 trillion cells that make you up. Some 60 trillion micro-organisms. If you stretched your DNA out it would stretch to Venus and back I think 40 times. Oh and what about the understanding that venus and earth are siblings, created at the same time with the same stuff yet one is an apocalyptic nightmare. There is clearly SO FKIN MUCH we don't understand and are built to not understand.

I feel like its saying a drop of water in an ocean is nothing. Well when you zoom out maybe you can clearly see that but the drop is the ocean still. It came from some beginning. It was a part of that process in a way. It never was meaningless... it contributed and is still contributing. That same drop. I know this sounds like an incomplete answer an incomplete box with an opening in it... that's the point for me at least.

I know it might sound like im not addressing the individual suffering we experience. But I feel like it does. I feel like suffering and thoughts of ""existence"" (to me this is a human thing its just a word) are so very human not the reality of what things are - I mean they are words we have passed on and words have always been the interpretation of something going on around us and in us and they have always been incomplete and pretty much not true and just the fastest way of trying to explain something that is unexplainable. Its a human problem not a fact about reality. A society problem. A culture problem.

Existential thoughts about suffering and existence.,2645406,Forever Sleep,"Aug 25, 2024 at 3:53 PM","I suppose I feel like all the stories we tell ourselves, the religions etc. is some desperate hope to justify that all the suffering will end up being worth it. I'm just not sure.

Maybe the enormous human ego we've developed has been fundamental in making us the dominant species here. Kind of impressive- we've been able to convince ourselves that we're so all mighty that we won't even actually die! That our consciousness/ spirit/ soul or whatever you want to call it can live on without the body. That we aren't in fact our bodies. I mean- maybe that's true.

But, equally likely I feel is that consciousness isn't some mystical ethereal thing. Why can't it just be a symptom of how the brain and body function in this world? I think it's because we don't understand it that it tends to take on this epic mythical status. But- why can't it be just another ability like sight or smell or hearing? Simply our brains processing the world we live in to try and keep us alive and preferably, reproduce before we die?

It's actually pretty masterful when you think about it- when it's working 'properly' that is. Not only are 'normies' instinctively afraid of death. Now, they feel so unique and self important that they feel the need to protect themselves and everyone else even more.

The majority of us have eyes and ears and noses. Does that mean we see, hear or smell in exactly the same way? No- probably not. Our genes and development and health likely affect how we do those things. Consciousness is the same- surely? If you'd been raised by different parents in a different environment- either a much nicer environment or, a much more abusive one- would you be the same person? Surely not. It would have impacted your sense of self. Sure, you'd still be aware you were alive. The same way you'd still be able to see if you still had functioning eyes in whatever life circumstances. But, we don't feel as mystified by sight or hearing.

I'm not a total cynic though. There are certainly some weird things about consciousness that make me question whether it could be something bigger. Like people who are blind from birth having visual dreams. When people seem to have psychic connections- like knowing a loved one is ill or in danger. Plus, common dreams we share- like flying etc. That all makes me puzzled as to whether there isn't some way of sharing consciousness. Connecting to something fundamental or something. It's just bizarre really.

I suppose I feel like our brains are telling us that we're alive (obviously) and- shit- how did this even happen? Why am 'I' the one witnessing this life? But then, I wonder if it is just another trick to make us feel important.

I think most people recognise that certain traits are produced via evolution. Whatever made a species more likely to survive and reproduce before it died would be passed on. What if this recognition of being alive was no different to developing an opposing thumb? A creature that actually recogised it was alive and maybe even importantly- that it could die could well have a superior edge over others that simply existed off of instinct. Maybe it's no more mystical than an evolutionary advantage.

Except now, we've bypassed natural selection and it's beginning to work against us- maybe. With things like depression, ideation, body dysmorphia etc. We've kind of become too complicated for our own good I think sometimes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's a force of attraction every ""body"" exerts on another body. But why is this force in place ? Why did the body acquire this property? Why does it have to attract ? Certain amino acids bond in a specific way with other amino acids to drive every single feature we acquire during birth . Why does only those specific amino acids do the job ? Who assigned them this ""feature"" to carry data? Every single ""property "" of every single particle can be questioned. But we leave it at that . We don't question further.

Existential thoughts about suffering and existence.,2646140,KuriGohan&Kamehameha,"Aug 26, 2024 at 9:18 AM","Nature and biology/life as a whole, at least in my opinion, is not intelligently designed by any stretch of the imagination. A more apt description would be a sophisticated machine, yet even machines can be prone to error, and make calculations or decisions that end up being counterintuitive if there are inherent limitations in its design and programming.

When it comes to living organisms, there is a high degree of conserved functions and homology between species. I'm sure many of you have heard the pop-science bit about humans sharing many genes with bananas, and it's actually true. A lot of the basic cellular functions required to sustain life are conserved throughout organisms. However, a lot of other traits that emerged in humans and shaped us as a distinct species from neanderthals and whatnot, either emerged randomly or were selected for by evolutionary pressures.

What may have been a useful survival instinct for a neanderthal or other mammalian species can become a bane for humans in the modern world and may actually inhibit survival and reproduction rather than enabling it. And therein lies the issue with the machine. Evolutionary processes are not sentient/born from conscious thought but operate on a more rudimentary level. You could have a very stable, thriving population of animals in a certain type of biome, only to find that they've been wiped out by a natural disaster the next day and gone extinct.

A trait may have been selected for that was beneficial yesterday, but a hindrance the next. Resources may become scarce, and then abundant. Some animals can adapt extremely quickly, others do not. This is one the cruelest aspects of nature to me. Every organism is fighting for survival and biological systems are wired towards continued existence even in the absolute worst conditions and situations.

It has been shown that the brain processes harmless spiders in a similar fashion as scorpions and fatal poisonous species, despite us being aware that the common garden spider and whatnot poses no threat. Even with the development of highly sophisticated, powerful cortical structures, those basal instincts are stubborn in the face of rational thought. They are so deeply ingrained.

Even when we as humans have the foresight and brain power to recognize something our biology is doing as harmful and determinental, the most frustrating thing is that many times we are powerless to stop it or manipulate the machine, despite the advanced of modern medicine. Even highly rated mathematical models cannot often predict for example, how a protein will be structured in a complex 3D space, or how evolution has occured within a population and how we can predict it in the future, many of these processes are still deeply mystifying.

Of course, we play god in other ways. As a species, we have basically stopped the flow of natural selection. Someone whose entire reproductive system is non-functional can now have an embryo created with their DNA using IVF. People too ill to carry a fetus to term themselves can have an embryo made and inserted into another mother to carry. Almost anyone can reproduce now and so no traits are really being filtered out from the population unless they are lethal/prevent a new life from reaching reproductive age to pass them on, or a person makes a conscious decision not to reproduce and remove themselves from the gene pool.

The environment which we occupy has changed so rapidly compared to our own biology, and despite our ability to adapt a bit epigenetically, I think the brain often cannot keep up with it, so consciousness and the ability to ruminate and reflect inadvertently becomes a burden. Consider the theory that humans often lived in tribes prior to modern civilization and cooperation was essential for survival. We evolved to be social creatures. The modern world is anything but social or cooperative for many people, and this juxtaposition is at odds with neural structures designed to seek out companionship. Consciousness likely exists to make us aware of the stipulations required for continued survival. We know the needs exist, having unmet needs is painful, and so our biology reminds of us that the pain is there, whilst giving us no outlet to resolve it.

Long ago, pain was primarily a danger signal, and a way for cells to indicate a level of toxic distress to the body that are impeding physiological systems from functioning as intended. Now, we have millions of people living with some sort of chronic pain and distress whether that be physical or mental. Clearly, this function is not working as intended, because living systems do not have the fine-tune level of control required in many cases to shut down things hijacking normal functions, DNA replicates and cells divide at such a rapid rate and eventually some mistakes cannot be repaired by cellular machinery.

Being a sciencey sort of person and not really a spiritual one has made me conceptualise suffering as a random, grotesque process that it is hard to break free from because biological machinery is poorly designed and life wants to persist in spite of it. It's why we can't really ever eradicate infections either. The human brain evolved to be so large that throughout history many women would inevitably die in childbirth because our anatomy is not conductive to birthing such huge infants without damage. If that doesn't illustrate how much of a shit-show biology is, I don't know what does.

I don't think there is a reason behind suffering, I think the capacity to feel such deep pain arose from random cellular events and has unfortunately persisted over time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

My wife has dropped a bomb on me out of the blue saying that she doesnt want to live with any regrets and wants a divorce even though we dont fight at all. So, now i'll be losing my house because i cant buy her out. Even if she walked away, the house payments would be uncomfortably high. Rent anywhere is almost as much as my mortgage for anything decent and i'd lose all my toys because i wouldnt have a garage. I'd end up with a shithole house in the ghetto in worse shape than i was in my early 20s. No wife, no house, no toys. I'm stuck with a job I hate just to survive. Time to walk out of the movie.

(Sorry for long winded backstory.) I was planning on a blood choke. I'm just afraid of something happening and waking up handcuffed to a bed in a hospital.

Now i'm thinking of shooting myself in the heart with a 9mm. I figure if i lock myself in the bathroom and wedge myself against the door, that should seriously hinder and rescue attempt before i bleed out. Thoughts?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Praying is probably a better way to put it. I've run every scenario I can think of and it really boils down to some variation of two. The problem is that I love her more than anything. I can't stand the idea that if something happens to her, I wont be there. And if something did, my heart would stop. I just simply wouldnt be able to take it.

If she essentially comes back around and agrees to try and work through whatever went wrong, then i'm good. But if not, I simply can not get set back 20+ years and have all the sacrifices I made be for nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I figured I should at least be suicidal for a few days before it actually committing to any sort of plan. This is the first week since purchasing SN that I feel like I could actually take my life. I've been suicidal for a few days Without any break.

I can barely hear anyone's words anymore and I've grown fixated planning my death. Maybe this is just a fear that mental health providers drill into you but I always Feel confused about my real desires Of wanting to live or not. I really don't belong anywhere in any community. So many people treat you so badly Just to make a joke or feed their own ego.

I can barely think straight or even communicate with anyone all I can think about is my own self destruction. Everything around me just seems to be melting.

To be honest I feel like I should act on these dark emotions sooner rather than later.

How long do I need to remain suicidal before committing to CTB?,2648365,Forever Sleep,"Aug 28, 2024 at 3:53 AM","It's a very difficult question to answer. From a logical perspective- what are the repercussions of suicide? On us for starters. We don't know for sure. It kind of hinges on belief. Will we be capable of regretting killing ourselves? If not then, logically speaking, our decision of when we do it only affects our life rather than what happens after. If there's nothing after this, it won't make a difference to our dead selves when we died. Of course, people who believe in an afterlife may have more to be concerned about if they also believe that suicide is punished.

Really though, if it's all about this life then, I guess you need to figure out whether you've got any hope and motivation left. What is it that makes you feel less suicidal? Are those things worth pursuing? Can they outweigh the times you struggle? I don't feel like there should be some set time period. I guess it would be concerning if someone had literally only had the thoughts for a couple of days and acted on them. But, I think it's more about what's causing these thoughts. Is there a fix for that? Can you hold on while you try to fix that?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
How long do I need to remain suicidal before committing to CTB?,2648382,Cress,"Aug 28, 2024 at 4:16 AM","I suppose a lot of pro lifers and mental health providers say that your mind is lying to you when you're suicidal although Some people would just say that these people are simply just gaslighting you into Denying yourself your true desire to take off and destroy yourself.

Either way depression has a weird phenomena of feeling like ""absolute truth"" When you're in it. It's difficult to know when to trust it.

There are things that I enjoy of course but my motivation for pursuing them have dropped immensely. My younger cousin took his own life 8 months ago by jumping in front of a train. Things have been different since then And my depression is almost been insurmountable even with tons of mental health support and I do mean a ridiculous amount. I also have a degenerate nerve condition that's destroying nerves all over my body but I'll be honest I sort of come to terms with that one already.

I'm pretty agnostic towards the whole consciousness after death. Ideally you would want consciousness to stop completely However It's difficult to say with any degree of certainty. Time essentially passes infinitely fast when you're unaware of it. When you're talking about infinite time passing who's to say in the far future when your consciousness might reassemble.

Maybe there's some sort of situation that can trigger consciousness into regret? Maybe the universe will reset itself at some point and play out exactly the same? I'll just have created a Universe where I infinitely live out the same life over and over again constantly killing myself. Living out the same trials and tribulations throughout my life. Sounds depressing. I definitely would have preferred to Have lived a better life if that was the case.",2648358,2648365,,,,,,,,,,,

That type of life doesn't suit me, it doesn't give me any motivation to strive for that, I am too broken for a normal life. I live for what I like and hope to get a method to CTB.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To answer your question, I haven't had a single attempt with SN yet, but I suspect it would end exactly like yours.

One day in June I was in an particularly bad mental state and I had a great urge to do it, but at the same time my stomach felt really bad and I was sure that I would throw up SN if I would made an attempt...

It's really disappointing to me that I keep making grand plans about catching the bus, and at the same time my eventual attempt would end in such a miserable and embarrassing disappointment...

I would like to CTB someday, but at the same time I don't know if I have any possibility to leave...

"a book, detailing all the methods and ways you can ctb.",2357019,aura.,"Feb 14, 2024 at 10:04 PM","The Complete Manual of Suicide is a book written by Wataru Tsurumi, published in 1993.

It features 11 different suicide methods and provides assessments of each, detailing the amount of pain each causes, the preparation required, the appearance of the body, and lethality. (More info here)

This book has never been translated into English, though I have found a translation for the foreword of the book.

I hope to make a book inspired by this Manual, though less detailed. I am researching and itemizing 4 of the methods listed in the Manual, and adding various other, updated, methods that may be more accessible.

I originally started making this book for myself, but I know many people find it hard gathering methods from across the internet and this site to create a pros and cons list for themselves, so I am thinking I may create a digital copy to post here when I am finished in a couple of months. Its still up in the air, but until then, enjoy the translated foreword.

The Complete Manual of Suicide



Foreword


This book describes the methods of committing suicide in detail.

It was not written by people who have attempted to commit suicide many times, and it is not written to explain the reasons behind committing suicide.


Although the book can be treated as a record of events, the whole book follows the main objective of showing anyone how to commit suicide.


Long ago, the topic ""why do young people commit suicide?"" had been discussed by various parties. In the 70s, the conclusions were something like ""nihilism"", ""age of sorrow"". Nevertheless, the questions, ""why can't I commit suicide?"", ""why must I stay alive?"" were never really resolved.


There's a need for a book, which can help one to commit suicide, to take actual actions, but not just having the idea in mind. Books with such aims were once published ten years ago - ""The Ways to Commit Suicide"" is an example. However, the book was not well organized and is boring. We only need to know the ways to commit suicide, not any other unrelated things.


In America, a scholar invented a machine, which allows ""mercy killing"" to be put into practice. And this book will be the only ""suicide machine"" in Japan, making use of words.


Speaking of this, I want to start introducing drug overdose. But to help you understand the question ""Why do we need to commit suicide now?"" better, and for other commercial reasons… I have to talk about some other things first.


A student rebellion took place 20 years ago. I was waiting for my time to show off my ability. Everyone thought that someone great would emerge. The Apollo landed on the moon. The oil crisis. The Soviet Union's invasion of other countries. I thought my actions would affect the whole world. But it just caused a little vibration - only a wall collapsed. Students faced each another and smiled. ""That's great!"" The rebellion is going to end…


At the end of the 80s, there was a trend of believing in the end of the world, and talking about dangerous topics, the famous bands performed songs about Chernobyl, the jokes coming out of kids' mouths all had the taste of death, teenage girls prepared for the world war by seeking a mate. And we cheered for beliefs like ""the emergence of the mighty"", ""tomorrow may be the end of the world.""


The end of the world didn't show up, the atomic bombs were left intact, the dream of having a world-wide nuclear war vanished. The revolutionists of the 80s were greatly depressed.


At last, everyone realized that there would be no time to show off their own ability, the 22nd century must arrive. (Of course, the 21st century is approaching, there won't be any world war.) There will never be an end of the world. We stretched our arms into outer space, but it couldn't bring us enough satisfaction. If we want more excitement, if we really want the world to come to its end, we have to do ""something"".



A Long Vocation


It's useless to say ""it's dull and boring."" We are all unlucky. We were born on this stage of past events. We will wake at 7am, either going to work or going to school afterwards. We will repeat the pointless speeches. At school, we keep reciting English vocab, histories, the reign titles; at work, we keep saying senseless things while we keep on working over different senseless projects, for a few weeks, a few months or a few years.


New inventions will be introduced at a slow pace. The slow-paced politician will keep on accepting bribes. The TV programs keeps on bringing excitement to its audience at a slow pace. After we switch off the TV, it will be just another ordinary day.


Yukio Mishima once wrote the lines, ""ordinary life is even more horrible than a war."" in his autobiography ""Confession d'un masque"". We tolerated the nervousness caused by the terrifying ordinary life, in return for the ridiculous ""calm and bright future."" We have to be careful throughout our life, trying in vain to avoid any mistakes.


There's no happy ending like the ones in the comedies. Happiness keeps on emerging repeatedly at a slow pace. Yes, the key is ""repeatedly"" and ""at a slow pace"". Substantial events keep on emerging repeatedly at a slow pace. This is the first element leading to suicide.



Another brick in the wall


A bridge maze suicide event took place in Japan in 1978.

Two sisters living in Toyoma, Japan were found dead, hanging on a tree. In a diary which belonged to one of the two sisters, four straight lines and several sidelines were drawn on one of the pages, forming a maze (a form of game finding the root by following the lines drawn.) Under the diagram, the following were found, ""Japanese"", ""Commit Suicide"", ""ROS"", ""Three Houses"" (Families that would be eligible for Tokugawa shogunate.) These incomprehensible words.


The line being drawn on that particular page led to ""Commit Suicide"". Their parents couldn't understand the motive behind their daughters' decision to commit suicide, therefore the conclusion that the girls died for the maze was formed.


It was thought that ROS meant ""Rolling Stones"", as the page also carried phrases like ""Japanese"", ""I hate Asian."" Nevertheless, no one can understand the true meaning of the words on that page.


A judge once said ""One's life is more important than the planet earth."" This is a pitiful misunderstanding of the fact. Just like what the two girls had realized, life is as fragile and as unimportant as can be, just like ""Japanese"" and ROS.


At the end of the 50s, scholars of the US said that everyone seems to lack strength. At the end of the 70s, rock bands sang ""We are a brick in the wall."" and became very famous. Even in the 90s, this situation has not changed in Japan.


Just like the old days, we are still a brick in the wall. The proof is, assume one of us dies; there must be a replacement for the deceased very soon. Everyone can be replaced by somebody else. Therefore, no politician warrants assassination. That is just one brick less in the wall, the wall will not collapse.


Everyone lacks strength, it doesn't matter whether we exist or not. Life is unimportant. This is the second element leading to suicide.



Clockwork Orange


We, people who lack strength, keep doing the same things repeatedly. We've forgotten the feeling of being alive. We can't tell if we are living or dead. Do you feel that you are ""alive"" now? At this stage, only a thin line separates living and dead.


Therefore the sayings, ""life is valuable, you should not commit suicide"", ""if you stay alive, everything will have a turning point"", ""your friends and relatives will feel sad for your death, so you have to stay alive"" can all be put aside; these are not convincing anymore. The convincing words which can stop one from committing suicide vanish; the signal for committing suicide emerges.


Yes, you can commit suicide. If you feel discomfort, resentment or even pain in your daily life at school or at work, you can take one step across that thin line into death. No one can stop you. Just like the previous paragraphs, nothing will change even if you stay alive and keep on facing these challenges. Although we don't have extraordinary powers, we can still tell what will happen to ourselves or to the society in the future.


""Future! Future!"" It's useless even as it's convincing. Your life will essentially be growing up and receiving your education in your hometown. You'll attend supplementary classes in the hope of getting a good result in the exams. You'll enter a high school or university and fool around for a few years before you start your career in a local company. If you are a man, you will get married between the ages of 25 to 30 and have your first child the following year. You will face several changes in your occupation, and at most be promoted as a manager. You will retire at 60 years old, and spend the rest of you life enjoying your habits. Finally, you face death. This is what you will get. And depressingly, this is the ideal life in many people's minds.


If this is the case, living an ordinary life is meaningless. You live as if you are the chicks in the farms, destined to be consumed in future. ""You are given the life to live. You are not living your own life."" Therefore, putting a full stop to it at a suitable time isn't a matter of feeling despondent, thinking that it won't happen twice or fear that the decision will trigger off massive chain effects.



Committing suicide is a positive act.



Angel Dust


I have a friend. He has a drug called ""angel dust"". People feel dazed after taking it and would be able to jump off a high-rise building without feeling anything. He has put the drug into a metal follicle and has attached it to a necklace, bringing it along with him wherever he goes.


He says ""I can take the drug and commit suicide whenever I need to."" My friend has no fixed job. He lives in idleness and is very happy about it.


I hope this book can be your little metal follicle necklace.""

Would a vet be willing to put my cat and dog to sleep without a reason? I have no one who would look after them for me when I'm gone. My dog particularly would struggle without me. My plan would be to have them put to sleep and then cremated so that they can be with me. They are aged 11 and 13 years but both could live for years yet, my old cat died at a few months shy of 20.

A vet who cares about animals is likely to prefer other solutions, and may refuse. There are definitely vets who don't care, though. There are also hunters who can do this.

I'd very much like to encourage you to put them up for adoption, though. While you could argue that death is merciful, that line of thought can justify killing just about anyone who cares about you. At least give them a chance at a happy life.",2646151,,,,,,,,,,,,

Not in terms of planning a suicide but, for example, a big move or something to a job with a lot of traveling, that you think that at their age you they wouldn't be able to cope with. Just to test the waters. It's something I've considered with my young dog, but she has behavioural and anxiety problems and I genuinely don't think she would cope in an adoption centre. It *is* a difficult and extremely emotive subject but sometimes our pets are best off never having to deal with the grief and anxiety of that parting. Obviously you know them better than anyone else but you need to be able to make an objective decision before you start approaching any vets.

In any case, I would insist on doing a REALLY thorough search on the quality of the procedures of the institutions I already mentioned. Should you find out their standards are good enough for your 4-legged buddies, then it seems you found a solution to your challenge.

On the other hand, if giving them to those institutions is simply not an option, then is it worthwhile for you to wait (several years) for your cat and dog to pass away naturally, then CTB?

There's just no way I'd be able to cope with doing that. I'd probably set myself on fire and reduce myself to a charred husk if I ever did something as atrocious as that, the guilt would make me truly psychotic and with my existing problems I'd just see it is an excuse to inflict even more serious and more painful harm to myself. But this time it would be something involving fire or something that would cause intense excruciating pain. Maybe I would tie a few bricks to my head and put my face into a bull ant nest, judging by how painful their stings are, that would be a good way to die too since their venom is super toxic.

Much better to just rehome them, find someone who cares about them, and will look after them. The problem is, because of what happened to those dogs up in the NT where they were tortured and mutilated then killed, I feel a terrible sense of dread as to what will happen to them. I'd want them to go to someone who I trust will not hurt them. I have a breeder's contact who knows people who want dachshunds and would take them if I ever had to do the final deed.

But because the doctor plainly refuses to treat my problem with blood thinners, you know, the most likely cause of all this sudden shit that leaves permanent damage every time a major episode happens, microclots yeah can't be anything else and yes, I'll kill myself if it happens again, if it EVER happens again. That's a serious threat mind you, there is no joking here, this is as real as it gets. I'd love it if a MACROclot would just lodge itself in my brainstem or one of the posterior arteries in my heart and just trigger a cardiac arrest. Then I wouldn't have to kill myself.

Yes, there is the risk that they don't end up getting adopted and end up living the rest of their lives in a shelter, however I honestly believe that is a greater kindness than ending their lives prematurely, as unlike humans they have no way of telling you if they ""want to go with you"".",,,,,,,,,,,,,

was this encounter sexual assault?,2623553,mittymittens,"Aug 7, 2024 at 5:59 PM","TW: potential sexual assault

i made posts like this but i feel the need to make another one because i need to be absolutely sure. im not asking in a legal type of way either.

i rejected this girl 2 months prior and she actively lied to me before this act that she gotten over me.

i was home alone and i invited her over.

she gestered me for a hug so i hugged her and then she began to kiss me all over my face without my consent. i remember my heart dropped and i didnt know what to do because 1. she was depressed prior to this and throughout my entire friendship with her i wanted to make her happy while ignoring my wants or needs. 2. her sister her off at my place and her sister was already mad for having to go to my place.

i remember just nervously laughing because i laugh when im nervous but then i just accepted this fate as my punishment because i already knew i fucked up and if i said no she would've been super upset because she was extremely sensitive and she couldn't call her sister nor her mom to drive her home because she wouldve 100% gotten yelled at which would've made her felt worse than she already did. when i laughed, i felt her smile and kept doing it more. i just went along and stayed silent because i knew i fucked up again. i do know i was trying to push her away at some point but i dont even think she realized. and i started gagging when she kissed me and she knew i was but kept doing it and didn't take it personally.

the only thing i honestly consented to was her kissing my lips. my thought process was that we were already doing related stuff so it wouldnt matter anymore and i also wanted to know what a kiss felt like because i did not kiss anyone prior to this.

my issue lies that at some point she wanted to go to my room. this is where i said no and she kept begging. during the second plea i remember having a unsure look at my face and saying ""i dont know"", she didnt stop until i said ""fine"". i dont think fine is enthusiastic consent. i think now that begging and pleading multiple times can mean coercion? but i also need reassurance on that one.

we went to my room and we still continued doing what she wanted to do. at some point she put her hand under my shirt without asking. luckily i was wearing a bra so nothing happened. but she knew i identified as asexual so i did not know what she was trying to do with this. i was definently not okay and i was beginning to feel scared and my heart was racing the entire time even before i was going upstairs because i felt nervous the entire time what else she wanted to do without asking. she asked if my heart was racing and since i didnt want to believe my best friend was doing something and i was actively lying to myself, i told her it mustve been the sugar from the drink i had.

at some point i was also aroused but i also know that your body is biologically able to do these things. while at the peak of my arousal i told her to keep kissing my neck because my mind was clouded. but at this moment it was nearing the very end of the entire thing before she left and i did not say something like this in the beginning.

when she left, i felt a metaphorical filth and i remember putting my sheets in the washer despite nothing got on it, cleaning my floor even though it wasnt really dirty and taking a shower but then ended up crying in the shower because i still felt dirty no matter how much soap i applied on my body.

a few days after this, i got a screenshot of her asking if what she was doing to me was uncomfortable. i did not confirm or deny but all i said was ""tbh i did not rly want us to go to my room"" and she only responded with ""sorry haha""

i understand implied nonverbal consent can work in relationships but i dont know if implied nonverbal consent can work if i had already rejected this person and expressed that i did not want to do anything romantic with her before this moment. i only saw her as a friend and after this happened i felt dirty and violated and i dont even know if im even valid enough to have these emotions because i feel like i mightve mislead her even though she also never tried asking for consent in most of these things",,,,,,,,,,,,,

You did not deserve that, you didn't want it no matter what your body made you feel and you have the right to feel that way. Consent should be enthusiastic, consent shouldn't be repeatedly begging for it, consent shouldn't be forced one way or the other.

You should talk to her and if she doesn't back down or guilts you for it you have the right to step back from her, what happened was horrible and you deserve better from a person.

And on the topic of Body Language consent, that would only be the case in established relationships and boundaries, not when you had rejected her prior and felt hesitant.

was this encounter sexual assault?,2633837,ForgottenAgain,"Aug 16, 2024 at 2:19 AM","I'm sorry you went through that. I can understand why you're uncertain on whether or not you mislead her. While I was reading your post I also went through a bit of uncertainty until I reached the following conclusion:

1. She pressured you into going to your bedroom. You said no but she kept insisting until you caved. Even though you caved, people are emotionally intelligent enough to differentiate between when someone caved because they want to and were just playing vs someone caving because the other person insisted enough. You were coersed.

2. Regarding the smiling, if she is your friend and knows you well, she must have noticed you smiling when nervous. This is quite common, I have the same reaction too. Freezing up and smiling due to nervousness is unfortunate when the other person doesn't care about your feelings, like I think happened here, but is not consent.

3. Accepting the kiss on the lips can be considered misleading, but it's important to take into account the order of things: first you froze, then you were pressured, you cave, now you accepted the kiss straight away. This could also be because prior you said no and she didn't take that answer so now you felt like it would be pointless to say no. You were already coerced.

The time when one doesn't need explicit consent or can be more relaxed with that is when in an established relationship. Even so, people in established relationships read body language and act upon consenting body language. If I was dating you, knew you well, and you were smiling while I was kissing you, I'd stop at some point, ask why you were smiling so much and your reaction to my question would tell me whether you were wanting to continue or not, even before you verbally gave an answer.

I'm sorry again that you went through this uncomfortable experience and felt so dirty. Some people don't care about other's feelings and put their selfish desires first. Don't let anyone take advantage of you again, you were too selfless. Put yourself first, say no confidently, push them physically away. Your well being matters and sometimes there's no one else to vouch for you, only yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

was this encounter sexual assault?,2648282,xandermax,"Aug 28, 2024 at 12:56 AM","I invited a woman over to my place one night. I guess sex was assumed, however I'd never met her IRL and when i did actually meet her i really wasn't attracted to her.

We spent a little while on the couch and after like 30 minutes i said she had better go. This totally changed her. She refused to leave, insisting we have sex. I stood up and she pulled my arm back. In the end i pulled her up and to my front door and insisted she leave. But she refused, saying ""let's just have sex"" multiple times, standing in my doorway. This went for about 5 minutes with her refusing to leave my doorway.

After a while of this I relented, and she pulled me back inside and onto my couch. We had sex, and it was pretty horrible and i didn't put in any effort. I just did it to get rid of her.

Other than my basketball coach sexually assaulting me when i was a boy, this is the closest to me being raped. And I'm a male, and she was a woman.

The thought of what happened still disgusts me somewhat.

So i can relate to what you went through.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I would discourage taking a knife to yourself as exsanguination is incredibly painful and the SI kicks in BIG TIME with that much pain, making it a lot more likely that you will just end up hurting yourself/possibly starving your brain of blood enough to cause brain damage but not death.

my life is a fucking joke,2646615,Death is love,"Aug 26, 2024 at 5:16 PM","i didn't ask to be born. whatever i did in a past life to deserve being sucked into this shitty world in the early 2000s, i don't know what i did to deserve it.

i was considered a ""gifted kid"" when i was diagnosed with autism at 3 years old. it was 2006, they were still using ""functioning"" labels then, and i was diagnosed as high-functioning. so much potential was wasted when i developed issues a little over a decade later.

when i was a kid, my parents fought many times, which basically guaranteed that i was gonna develop issues later in life. i lost an online friend of mine to suicide in 2014. i cried about it for over a year, for those past 10 years i felt like i could've saved her. all of that just proves my point.

then i, the ""gifted kid"", started going off the rails in 8th grade, when i developed mental issues and as a result, started doing shittier in school. the summer after i finished 8th grade left me a traumatized, jaded wreck. it pretty had set up how i would spend high school: being an angry, jaded, crying wreck who tries to act all smug and shit so people won't worry about me. i had a meltdown over an episode of my favourite web show. how pathetic is that? i was a very jaded teenager. all of that proves my point.

a good friend of mine i had for 7 years, who was once very supportive and sweet to me, turned out to be a fucking monster. this only further proves my point.

i got fucking gr00med and sexually harassed, both irl and online. i feel like it's all my fault.

i was in a relationship with someone i loved. they turned out to be grooming someone behind my back, doing everything in their power to hide it from me. they loved the person she groomed and a gay man (who clearly didn't like them back) more than me. i wasted my money on gifts for that bitch. i gave my virginity to them. this only further proves my point on my life being a joke. that's always what my first time is gonna be.

i've had intrusive thoughts telling me that my life is a joke and that my death will be the punchline. i had a nightmare last night where i lost everything and everyone i cared about. i feel like they're right, and i feel like i should just fucking die after that so i can save myself the pain of that dream becoming a reality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

IBS symptoms can be reduced with a change in diet and lifestyle. Look at your stress levels, your caffeine intake, how much spicy food you eat, what beverages you are drinking. There are many things that can trigger it and you don't even realise.

I had really severe IBS like yourself, until I looked at my diet and stress levels. Yeah, stress levels can't be controlled but diet can.

If this doesn't ease, especially with reducing stress levels and certain foods/drinks, another trip to the doctors is always worth it. This can get better. It isn't something you should just live with, that isn't fair. It isn't worth killing yourself over either

Have you actually had any tests done or have doctors simply brushed it off as IBS? Because I had the consant shits, even blood in my stool came back 'normal', so I demanded to be referred to the hospital for tests. It's a camera test, up the bum. Really simple and they can find inflammation while there. I was diagnosed straight away with Ulcerative Colitis, and there are several forms of Colitis.

Thank you so much for the encouragement, I still do have hope for a better life with less symptoms, but whenever my symptoms flare up I have a tendency to go straight to being suicidal, since I already had depression even before getting IBS too (probably they're linked).

So when inflammation is in other areas such as the rectum, the symptoms are different, and they can be: NO blood, constipation, and something called 'overflow', essentially that is constipation and then the shits. Constipation is a big factor. That is called Ulcerative Proctitis. Essentially, it means inflammation in the rectum. I had previous higher up flares, hence where Ulcerative Colitis came from. Just letting you know, because often symptoms can appear as something worse than they are, or not as bad as they are

I honestly think you need to get this looked at. Even if a doctor gives you something to ease symptoms. Totally your choice, but things often get misdiagnosed or ignored etc, when people are suffering. You shouldn't suffer in silence.

I've sold everything that wasn't bolted down that I could sell. I've got 3 different sourced SN packages. I decided I'm going to test the CO levels once I'm at my location. It really doesn't make a lot of sense to test another location.

My prayers have all gone unanswered. I read the Bible every day, prayed, and fasted in May. That resulted in one of the worst periods of my life ever. I can no longer pay my bills.

Deep state initially took $85,000 from me (more than my life savings). I recovered from that beating. They now cleaned out my remaining money. Brutal, brutal people.

I just lost my place of living. That should be the catalyst I was looking for to overcome SI. I'm actually not remotely concerned about SI any more because I literally have no way to survive. I've had two prior attempts where I consumed things that I believed would kill me. So, I'm very, very confident now that I have the right method. Hint: don't ever consume pharmceuticals or over-the-counter meds for to CTB.

Awful health, no family, no friends, no money, no place to live, and the deep state won't stop beating on me. In poker lingo, I have no outs. I'm drawing dead in life.

I doubt I'll do a goodbye thread (who knows though...maybe); but I will shoot the community a note on the day of.

I'm pretty lax with health and safety in my job- lots of nasty chemicals, aerosols, fumes, dust. I don't always bother with a mask. My diet isn't at all good either.

Maybe the most risky thing I've done is gone on a guided walk along what used to be the West Pier in Brighton in the UK. We had to wear life jackets and crash helmets and sign a disclaimer that we knew we were entering an unsound structure. I thought it was so epic... More or less- I understand that I might die.

Really though, it probably wasn't that unsafe. I mean, it did eventually collapse and then it went up in flames- before they could refurbish it. (All very suspicious) but, they did risk assessments before each tour I think. We weren't allowed right to the end into the second building that day. It was awesome though.

They intended to refurbish it back to how it looked in a specific time period. They were going to have to pull Blacksmiths out of retirement to do some of the work! I believe they intended to raise the height of the whole thing too to counter the rising sea levels.

I wish they had been able to do it. At some point, the first building we went in partially collapsed and was hanging off the back. Then, there were arson attacks. There were conspiracy theories that it may have been the Trust itself- set up to do the conservation work but, I doubt it. Or, I really hope not. People like that seem usually to be hugely passionate about saving those buildings.

I kind of love the Victorian era. For its innovation but kind of crazy ideas. They believed the salty air was good for your health and piers were a way of getting closer to it. Kind of funny. Apparently, when you got to the end, they would offer you a glass of sea water. .

There used to be two piers in Brighton. The Palace Pier still stands- thankfully. But apparently, they also used to dive from either, swim and meet for tea between the two. There were drawings of barrels with tea cups on and swimmers gathered round. I just think the contrast is so funny. I tend to think of the British Victorians as being very straight laced and proper but, some of the risks they took with stuff would never happen today.

If objectively observable progress isn't being made according to whatever goals were set out at the beginning of therapy, then they need to address this and figure out if there are any obstacles they can help break down or any alternative approaches in treatment they can try, or maybe a psychiatrist should be seen in conjunction with the therapy to adjust medication regimen. There are a lot of different factors that can slow down or stop progress. Many of these factors can be addressed. But if not, then they should be referring you elsewhere to someone who may be better equipped to help you move forward. As the patient, it is OK to initiate this conversation with them.

Expectations and general goals should be agreed upon very early on in the process, with a check-in on this subject once in a while to ensure that both patient and therapist are still in accordance.

While some people may benefit strictly from ""just having someone to talk to each week and having their feelings validated,"" generally, both parties want to see consistent progress being made (while allowing for temporary setbacks), otherwise looking at what's inhibiting that progress or else referring out.",2648060,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ideas on Getting a DNR as a Healthy Subject from PCP?,2647703,DeadManLiving,"Aug 27, 2024 at 2:28 PM","So my impression is that DNRs are usually used in end of life/palliative care inpatient settings or for other exceptional circumstances but not ordinarily conferred to normal subjects that have no reason or ailments to be concerned with the process of obtaining one.

The question is how to get one as a healthy subject from a doctor? With the widespread doubletake checks PCPs on high alert under scrutiny to look out for signs by the MH community, what are some methods to obtain a valid DNR without a doctor or with a doctor but providing a plausible benign explanation.

Scuba diving lessons? New high risk job offer?

Does a DNR need to be signed by a doc? Would a properly notarized Advance Directive essentially have the same effect?

And where are the lines drawn between cardiac or respiratory failure and arrest? My understanding is that if you have a DNR they can't do CPR or resuscitate if you're in respiratory or cardiac arrest but what about respiratory failure? Where are the lines drawn?

Can any lawyers or medics clarify? Also I believe that a DNR is invalid and you can proceed to perform life-saving measures provided that you're responding to a suicide but how do you know that it's a suicide?

You would be risking your certifications if you went against the DNR order so how would you determine if (1) the call for service involved a person with MH history but cannot ascertain if the subject in cardiac arrest or RF was an act of suicide and (2) would an Advanced Directive be honored as a DNR if the person had it nearby in plain sight?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you tell your doctor that you want to be DNR, they will put it in your chart. DNR just means that if your heart stops, they won't do chest compressions or try to chemically resuscitate you. (People often combine DNR with DNI which means that if you stop breathing, they won't put a tube down your throat and hook you up to a ventilator.) It doesn't mean they won't give you medical treatment in all other circumstances.

If your doctor asks you why you want to be DNR/DNI, just tell them it's against your religious beliefs. They usually don't argue with that.

An advanced directive is more official than a DNR/DNI order but you may need a lawyer and/or a notary to get one.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I completely understand what you mean if it is close to your eye I would also want to get something like that checked, I tried avoiding going to doctors appointments because I knew I was going to ctb soon but some stuff you just gotta do incase the plan doesn't work out and then you're stuck with permanent damage.

Right, I am going to get it checked. If I had to ctb I might do it first anyway. From my experience, most cancers are painful. My spouses aunt recently died of, I think, liver cancer or something like that, and it was BAD.

I did get diagnosed with some yeast infection, though, that I'll be treating over, at least, the next 5 months. It's a real pita since I have to use a spatula to apply the cream 2X a day, and another lotion once a day, which has to be rinsed off in a shower after 15 minutes each time. The only reason I even went to the dermatologist is bc my pcp saw the spots on my back and, basically, insisted, that I get them checked out. She's treating me for an auto-immune hypothyroid condition, so I didn't want to ""rock the boat"" too much by refusing to have the spots looked at. I wasn't functioning very well with my untreated hypo, and I was a little concerned that I wouldn't be able to finish up the stuff I need to before I ctb, so that's why I sought treatment again for my hypo. If it were just the spots, I would never have even bothered getting them checked out. But, the hypo was making me sleep all the time and I wasn't getting enough things done.

Os detalhes mais importantes sobre o CO2 praticamente morreu, não consigo entrar no site de maneira alguma, mas como é um método ""razoável"", só tenho algumas perguntas:

1. Qualquer carvão utilizado irá funcionar no método?
2. Apenas se coloca a churrasqueira com o carvão já queimado ou quando ele estiver queimando? Ouvi dizer que mesmo queimado, ele ainda libera CO2
3. Se o ambiente ficar extremamente quente, o que faço para aliviar a temperatura?
4. Quanto tempo levará até eu ficar inconsciente e quanto tempo levará até eu partir?
5. Quanto de carvão será necessário pra fazer CO2 suficiente?

Hello. I have ordered from DMC, and it's in transit right now. I live in a dorm, and that's where it is getting sent and I don't know like how packaging policies work and all packages need to be picked up from a desk assistant in the front. What is on the packaging label? Does it say SN, or is it something else? When I ordered when they were MDS long ago, it was labeled as paint pigment, but I don't know if that's changed. What can I expect it to say? I'm worried about getting questioned and not getting my package. I'm really scared and anxious as it is if it'll even arrive so I would like some clarity and preparation.

But I was thinking about combining full sus with a propranolol od, since I have loads (at least 3 bottles Filled to the brim) of propranolol and have some ondansetron (maybe 3-5pills) left (trying to get meto and possibly some domperidone.) I'm not entirely sure when I'll attempt, but I have a feeling it'll be sometime this year or early next year as things in my life keep getting worse and I don't think I have much time left.

One could, also, place a dowel rod or pipe between the trigger and trigger guard and then position the gun so that the stock is butted up against a wall or something. Then the feet could be used to push on each side of the dowel, which, in turn, would push against the trigger and fire the gun.

But if I won't reach the trigger then the only option I have is to buy a short barrel shotgun. I will also look for a shotgun combo that comes with 2 barrels, each replaceable barell is different in length, so that would be perfect if I found such a gun once I travel back home.

Wanting/needing that longer barrel is just adding more complexity to all of this, though.

I guess this is a rant/vent/story. I'm just... lost. I'm in my 40s. I'm not married but been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 9 years. No kids. I still live with my mother because I accumulated so much debt when I was younger, I can't afford a place on my own (and the bf doesn't live/work in my city and he is back home, too). I've struggled with my mental health for decades. I was a shy/socially anxious child. I know my parents did their best to raise me, but damage was done by them (emotionally and unintentionally). I had my ""first attempt"" when I was 14. (I knew nothing about meds at the time so the attempt is laughable now. But the intent was there). I lived in a super small town, wasn't popular and hated myself/anxious about high school. Got therapy and was on a brighter path... until my dad died when I was 15 (almost 16) I didn't have a great relationship with my mom. I held on with the support of my friends until before college... when my mom moved my brother and I to a new city where we had no friends. With the help of my cousin, I was able to start a life in this city while attending school in another city. But then things turned for the worse... got a boyfriend who made me feel like I was something for once... only to cheat on me & imply that I was getting fat. That, on top of meeting a new, manipulative @hole... I developed an eating disorder that has almost killed me several times and I still endure 22 years later. I made 3 more attempts in June of 2002 (all in one week). I got admitted to the psych ward 2 of the times... but got out within 6-12 hours. Started dabbling with illicit substances shortly after. But I really liked it. Wasn't an addict but did it pretty much every weekend. Had relationships/engagements throughout the next 2 years... and then moved again. Self harm entered the picture and health really deteriorated due to the eating disorder. But I wasn't thinking about CTB really back then. Ended up going to an inpatient program for the ED. Saved my life. But the ""catty""ness of the other girls made me leave prematurely...
Ended up having 2 more serious bouts of trying CBT (ended up in the psych hospital again for 3 days). My ED has basically been the focus of my mental health issues since then (with more inpatient/day patient programs) I'm at a stable weight now, but still sick.
The last 2 years have been probably the worst for me. Problems with the BF, still living at home, in debt, working 2 jobs (and stopped enjoying both), had the only friend who really understood me CTB, had to put my cat of 19 years down.... and developed a daily addiction to illicit drugs/alcohol. And I don't know what to do. I have most of my affairs in order, my letters written... no method picked or date yet. I told my BF in April I had planned to CTB in May... and he freaked out. Threatening to call my doctor, tell my family... so I said I'd postpone. But nothing has gotten better; just worse. My family doctor is exasperated by me, there's a lack of psychiatrists (and the last one said meds won't help me. I've already tried most of them). I don't see any point in going on for myself. I hold on for everyone else... but it's no way to live. Sooner or later, I'll probably get fired from my jobs for my addiction and go broke. I feel lonely all the time... and when I try to talk to my friends/family... they don't get it. Or they avoid me because of my thoughts.

i owe a hospital money for when i was involuntarily checked in. safe to assume it's related. been ignoring it because i never had any intention of paying them. i guess this is it. more rules and laws of society catching up for something i never fucking wanted in the first place.. i failed so many attempts resulting in me still being here. i never planned to live this long and i fucking hate it.

i see three options. kill myself sooner so i will never have to worry about anymore debt, pay it with what very little money i have or try to basically beg online for people to support me financially to pay off the debt. there's also another debt waiting to be paid next year and if i don't, irs will take everything i own. i have no intention of working anymore as i'm done being miserable working a meaningless job like everyone else, but the longer i live, the more problems that come up. i have no energy to do any of this bullshit..
i fucking hate this life..i fucking hate the people who called the cops and put me in that god damn hospital...people who are too stupid and refuse to understand that when i say i can't handle this life anymore, it means i can't handle it anymore..i fucking lost everything that meant a lot to me after that day...

fuck all of the people who call the cops on someone needing to kill themselves and inflicting more problems unto them.. gambling with our lives just so you can make yourselves feel better..

I felt I didn't owe it, so I just didn't pay it. The notices kept coming, but I just ignored them. After a while, they stopped, but would just start up again a few months later. Eventually, the hospital turned the debt over to a collector. They hounded me, too, but I continued to ignore them, also. The debt got passed on to another collection agency who started hounding me. Eventually, this collection agency took it to the next step and filed suit in court to collect the money. After receiving the notice that I was being sued, I got another letter from the collection agency telling me they would drop the suit if I just paid them $100 on the debt. That's what I did, even though I still felt I didn't righfully owe the money. I would have owed a lot more than the $130 if I would have lost the small claims case. It just wasn't worth it. All for a lousy $130. You hear about hospitals writing off debt when they are unable to collect it, but that sure hasn't been my experience.

I am alone and scared 💔,2647285,SoulWhisperer,"Aug 27, 2024 at 6:34 AM","PS: This post ended up being long as fuck, so if you have some time to spare for the pathetic person I am it would mean a lot if you wouldn't skip thru. If you don't want to read this textblock of life story (a shard of it actually) go and click on another post it's alright anyway.

I'll be honest. I am scared. I am scared of what is going to happen next. I genuinely frightened about how my life will change in the next few months, because they will be critical months most likely. Things might change drastically and I might end up living elsewhere that is not the abusive hell of my parents' house. Lemme be clear: I'd pay gold to get out of here but I wouldn't if that meant living with relatives that can't handle more people under their roof or even worse if it meant ending up on the streets. As stupid as it sounds my biggest and most important coping mechanism is games and my PC is the only thing that kept me going for the past 2 years.

I have ""discovered"" the existence of suicide about 4 years ago, it was a dark cloud in my mind that roamed ever since my life had started going downhill and no, nothing got better, so there's pretty much no nothing that could tell me ""hey, well 4 fucking years went down the drain, but as they say fifth's time a charm, right?"". Then after that cloud was formed in the form of of a passive thought it became something tangible 1-2 years after when I actually started to look up methods and stuff, just to get a general information mashup. Then I arrived here I believe at the end of the run, which I'm glad since I have no other place I'm fully safe talking about this without repercussions.

Thing being that now suicide has become an integral part of my existence and I can't go 24h without thinking about it. I have A TON of problems already but I won't focus on that now (my past posts explain some of them). To sum up I'm suicidal because of other human beings harming me endlessly. I don't have inherent trust issues but I will never blindly trust someone or trust someone fully because I know that they CAN betray me. I'm not saying they will, but they COULD. And I'm NOT taking any more fucking risks after discovering how a single DM with someone crushed a part of me to ashes. The internet is not a heavenly place, any1 can dig information about you with free intelligence, the information about yourself that you decide to voluntarily or not post online that can help others understand how you act/behave/usually do more or even worse get identifying information about yourself that can be used to track you in any way. I am deathly afraid of stalking because I know how bad and hard to counter it can be even if you KNOW you're getting stalked. Police can't live in your home and walk you anywhere to protect you from people with bad intentions and a life where you constantly fear for your life is NOT cool my friend. So I feel extreme compassion and sadness when hearing stories or posts about people living in those conditions.

That thing apart (which is one of my fear for when I'll be on my own). Another actual (as in, that is present now) problem is that I my mind is fucked up. It's no surprise I'm a psychopath and sociopath inside. I can still be friendly with others or pretend to care when deep inside I only make friends for self-gain rather than happiness about making bonds. If I could I'd live alone forever but however it's hard due to society so I forge connections to help myself. My friend protect me, they help me overcome stuff, reassure me, listen to me when I vent and so much more (excluding fake friends and those who betrayed me over a long time span, which is not just a few people). In return I offer them my advice, I listen to their concerns and give my 2 cents. I protect them however I can and do what I can to ensure they're okay most of the time. (Do note that irl I'm alone and I've lost all friends so this is mostly talking about online self which has become so prominent to almost overshadow my real self almost) Even if I do all those things for them that doesn't take out that I have extreme violent intrusive thoughts, fucking hate human race in its entirety with few exceptions and can't stand anything.

My mind is fucked up with mental illness that I never got the chance to verify or diagnose with a professional but it's no wonder I'm not okay. I share 90% of common traits of people with BPD and let me tell you that struggling with the way you view relationships is not fun. I go from wanting friends from wanting to tell my friends to fucking lose themselves and that I never truly cared about them in the first place.

But what's the most debilitating of issues in my mental health are my identity issues. I struggle so much with defining what exactly I am if not a monster that deserves death. I literally can't look at myself in the mirror without feeling disgusted or without failing to recognise myself physically.

I am fucked up, really fucked up and I feel IMMENSE phycological pain. I hear voices inside my head I see things that don't exist inside of me and that's the result of coping mechanisms that went out of control. I used to try to suppress painful memories so much to the point that my mind suppresses way more and sometimes causes a so deafening sound that I feel pain. At night I have hallucinations, I hear people calling my name I see silhouettes running outside my windows in the night, I see shadows in the corner of my dark room I see figures running in the corner of my eye and whenever I look at them they disappear. I could list endlessly the abnormality of my brain that I despise and kinda love at the same time just for allowing me to move.

""Should I CTB or not?"" Is my question drilled in my head daily when shit happens. Should I keep living with the daily delusions, pain, abuse, stress, trauma, hallucinations, voices, failures and so motherfucking on in the blind hope that one day I might magically overcome my DEATHLY and crippling social anxiety enough to find a job and move out alone to rot forever in my own bubble or should I just call it a life and step out of step out of scenery to avoid further pain? My life is a hopeless pain, and no. Even if someone lays down all the solutions to my problems (as if I don't know more than half of them myself already) that doesn't mean shit will get better. A thing is knowing how to fix your life another thing is fucking doing it and praying it'll work out...

I'm not actually asking if I should CTB or not, I know it's up to me but I'd love any words of compassion or anything if you actually think I deserve them... It's... Painful... Too much painful...

I failed in school and got held back so I'm slow as fuck, nowhere close to finishing. My original plan was to CTB before my birthday this year but I scrapped it due to lack of reliable resources for methods unfortunately. My plan B is to go on like nothing, keep enduring trauma the best I can, dropping out and finding the most accessible real job that can pay me bills to DREAM to move out... It's my fucking dream to live alone but I can't fucking live alone, I'm too weak for this world... I am... Too fucking... Weak... Sigh.

My family doesn't exist, they only harm me and pretend to love me. I have no partner, no friends, no family, no nothing.

I am stupid if I think I am actually capable of going through with any plan of my life. Every plan always gets fucked up due to my mental instability and it breaks me. I would never wish to anyone to live in my condition even if they were my worst enemy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

At 13 and at 16. Then some other stuff. However at the time I was fine. I wasn't depressed, let alone suicidal. The last time my teacher ""snitched"" on me by calling my mother at the end of the year after failing telling her how I am ""abnormal"" according to her because still according to her I didn't talk to anyone whole year, which was false. How fucked up does things need to be for a TEACHER to call me out from behind the scenes like that...

The year after that thing actually went shit to this day and age. I did think about seeking professional help and as you know it's not exactly easy. The times I went I didn't know why I was there so I had nothing to tell my therapist. Although I don't know what I could expect from one, after all they can just talk, and I pretty much talk with my mind and figure stuff out too.

The issue is that the window of what is considered illegal hate speech may shift.

This has happened many times historically; in the aftermath of 9/11, for example, what was considered acceptable government surveillance shifted and then the PATRIOT Act was passed.

I would argue that unless the hate speech (a term that can be misused) is actually harming people via harassment/doxxing/etc there is zero reason to prosecute and jail them. Block buttons exist.

Why is there such an insistance on having a world be hyper connected where everyone and anyone can go anywhere and the native populations must cowtow to the demands of a new arrival?

I think it's hateful to force a population to bow down to their replacements and not have any methods available to them to speak out against it.

It's not clear to me whether this brand of charcoal does, or does not, contain other additives. Their website seems to indicate that they source their product, at least partially, from sawmill scraps. Charcoal should be additive free, 100% carbon. The pictures seem to indicate that the charcoal is not fully burning. The first step should be to get all of the charcoals burning red hot outside of the room. There should be no smoke. A chimney starter usually works best for this. If a room is used it should be as small as possible and sealed tightly. Also, how much charcoal is needed is completely dependent on the size (volume) of the room and the MINIMUM amount needed can be calculated using the guiding parameter of .135 kg/m³ of volume.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To me my Death is the best thing that could happen to me by a trillion times all my problems solved instantly and forever, all threats eliminated , no chance ever of any pain problems suffering bad memories, boredom, diseases , old age and 1000 other horrible things in this hell called life ever threatening me again: how how is that something to not devoutly wish for as Shakespeare intimated?

Everywhere people say that ""we don't know what is after Death"" ,""We are not sure..."" or they believe in an afterlife or reincarnation etc.

I don't know how many people are like me that are certain that after Death a human will cease to exist forever. I assume it's a very small percentage maybe less than 3% of the population i'm guessing . i haven't seen many posts anywhere even here that i remember where people are sure that it's non-existence forever . yeah i've seen a few here but it seems most are not sure.

to me it's like saying that people are not sure what life is or where it came from or what a human is .

very smart hard working people like Charles Darwin have been working on finding out these questions for hundreds of years . it's known. evolution is true.

Mature sciences like neuroscience brain science, evolution, psychology , cell biology many others have thousands of books decades of evidence millions of webpages proving evolution is true and that the mind consciousness thinking all are generated only by the brain.

All humans and all life evolved from a single cell. a single cell is the ancestor of all life that exists on this horrible Earth.

Chemical evolution , chemicals combined and evolved to form the first cell .

That cell is the ancestor of every living thing.
All Life on Earth Comes From One Single Ancestor. And It's So Much Older Than We Thought.
Scientists have pushed back LUCA’s origin by hundreds of millions of years.
www.popularmechanics.com
""The common ancestry of all extant cellular life is evidenced by the universal genetic code, machinery for protein synthesis, shared chirality of the almost-universal set of 20 amino acids and use of ATP as a common energy currency""

Are you scared of what comes after death?,2646808,Himeasa,"Aug 26, 2024 at 7:36 PM","I do not believe that there is any self-evident supernatural truth. What we observe is a living thing, then death, then a dead thing with no brain-activity. Why is it that there should be something after death? Why ask this in the first place? Why are we even construing the idea of an ""after death"" if not for our living minds racking our brains to make life make sense? We as organisms are spurned by evolutionary pressure to survive and proliferate at any cost.

It's not that there is ambivalence between the ideas of something after death and nothing after death. It's that there's the fact of death which precedes all else, and subsequently our struggle with the thought that we may eventually cease thinking and feeling, and as such construct an escape, a sense that there might be something following death. The burden of evidence lies with the proponents of an afterlife.

As I view it, such religious concerns reinforce the mundane basis for all of this, fretting organisms which can think reifying their existences as such, to make sense for the organism as the organism, from the view of the organism and to the ends of the organism as itself. A circle drawn so not to confront the inevitability of mortality. We are after all very mortal little cells and we will perish and these cells will lose function: it is these cells which pose these inquiries because they refuse to be merely mortal little cells. Nothing more to it, I think.

The form in which we exist is the basis to our processes of thinking and feeling. Our structure. Death is the prime antithesis to the living form, hence that we cannot conceive it, hence that it is irreconcilable with our minds and cultures. Our brains are furthermore programmed to insist on our existences as much as possible, so we intentionally delude ourselves in addition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I hope a nuclear war breaks out and eradicates humanity,2485866,tunnelV,"Apr 26, 2024 at 2:54 PM","I think an alien invasion would be funniest ngl. I mean ask any random man or woman in the USA about themselves. They will all claim to have these characteristics. Attractive, intelligence, maturity, grace. It's funny because almost nobody has one of those things much less the entire package. Not sure when it happened but everyone turned into a self serving self ass kissing delusional narcissist. Specifically unnamed age group.


Never saw so many collective pos circle jerking themselves about themselves. The lies and the faking, it makes me want to puke. When people started lying to each other kissing each others asses but have no genuine meaning behind it. I'm actually not shocked at all that people are unable to make friends nor find meaningful relationships, or romantic relationships. It's unnatural, actually these people are worse than low level AI programs. You have a better chance with connecting with that. Probably because AI won't make things up in their mind projecting their insecurities. This age group can't even properly socialize. You say one thing and they respond ""that doesn't make it right"" or ""are you saying this and that"" they add on shit you never said and expect you to respond to the very same fake bullshit they made up in their own mind.

If I don't KMS I actually planned on leaving this sinking ship rotten country. I'm in the USA where they breed a special kind of moron who's barely human. I also find it gross that humans can harm animals in almost every country and get a slap on the wrist or of course pay the state? It's a society completely void of morals.

I think other countries people can still be decent and genuine overall. I think growing up in the USA destroys your mind and humanity due to the shit culture. I actually abandoned everyone in the USA as friends, family and romantic options years ago, how gross and weird they were. Its why I'm engaged to a man from Europe. One of the most sane and normal people I've ever met in my life. No American is mentally stable including me.

Like when did someone being honest become people collectively harassing them, trying to destroy their lives. They call it cancel culture but its really just collective sadism. These same people CRY when they aren't called a 10 but a 5, it honestly doesn't get more disgusting than that.

Another thing that is irritating is some of these people were NOT born. Will take something that happened in the 90s an interview for example and pretend it's their own trauma and it effects their current life. That's how bored they are that they have to invent fake trauma for themselves based on a 10 second video. Must be NICE having none of your own trauma and being so empty you don't think past 10 seconds. With that kind of attention span you can have any impossible delusional about yourself.

So an alien invasion would be very funny. Imagine how many people would mindlessly stand there recording. With their mouth open and drooling and expecting the aliens to ""do the right things"" and not blast them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Everyone is a sheep, except me. Only I see the truth because I'm smarter than everyone else"". - Nearly every human to ever exist

I hate to break it to you, but you are about as much of a thoughtless sheep as the next person. You are no more enlightened than anyone else. This type of post just reeks of an unchecked superiority complex. Most people are already aware of the fact that the world we live in is really fucked up at the moment. That's all that people talk about. You are not special for noticing this shit. Everyone knows this, hence why everyone is blaming each other for it.

There is this line a song I like that goes:

I'm highlighting this because it's getting to the point where, not just you, but people in general need to get this through their skulls. Everyone has problems and we are all suffering at the moment. This world is basically a dystopian nightmare for most of us. Some people are able to cope with it better than others because they may have certain things going for them that makes life slightly easier to deal with, but we are all suffering. Everyone is aware of the fact that shit is going downhill, but not everyone knows how to respond to that. You aren't above anyone for recognizing the bad in this world. You are not above anyone in general. You are no more human than anyone else.

The best people put there are the ones who see the flaws in our world and who fight tooth and nail to fix them because they care about others. They keep on fighting, even when it's a losing battle because to them even finding a way to make life slightly better for those around them is enough. Sitting down at home and talking about how everyone is beneath you and how only you see the truth makes you about as much of thoughtless sheep as most of the people out there because that's what most people are doing. I'm saying this as someone who is also a fucking dumb ass who needs to get their ass up and actually do more to help others (I think I might go into volunteer work, idk).",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Did I ask for too much?,2647299,struggles_inc,"Aug 27, 2024 at 6:55 AM","Recently I had the unpleasure to be yelled at by a client. The reason for them screaming all kinds of slurs at me was that I offered them a video call instead of just talking in chat. I understand some people are introverted, but we needed to talk money, so I saw a video call as solid option. Anyway, he reacted in a very inadequate way, not much to my surprise. I got a couple voice messages calling me all kinds of names.

He's been rude to me since the moment we got to know each other. About half a year. That was the breaking point for me. I noticed that he was rude only to me, though he also talked to some of my colleagues. I'm not sure if gender nuance is present here, but I'm a girl and they're all guys. Anyway, I asked a male colleague to talk to this lovely gent on my behalf and drop him as a client because I can't anymore (he won't be punished for dropping a client since, well, I'm the company founder).
I asked this, completely understanding this is just a request, and he has the right to say no. And, well, he did.

He said to me he's not going to be my buffer zone. He said all that is exclusively my problem. He said he's not going to defend me.

At this point, I feel like two people were rude to me for no freaking reason. Did I ask for too much?

Did I ask for too much?,2647323,Unspoken7612,"Aug 27, 2024 at 7:24 AM","Sounds like you're the boss - is that correct? If so, you'd be well within your rights to delegate this sort of task to one of your employees, and to tell them to do it rather than ask.

That said, good leadership would probably involve you doing it yourself and it's somewhat understandable that a subordinate would be reluctant to do this sort of task, especially if this client has an anger issue.

You shouldn't have to feel unsafe, so maybe dropping the client via email is your best bet. Do you have a generic company email address you could use rather than one with a gendered name?

Otherwise - look, we're not there with you, we can only go off what you have told us, which even with the best of intentions is going to omit some details. I can't imagine any excuse for the client's behaviour and it sounds wildly disproportionate. I'm sorry you had to go through that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Did I ask for too much?,2647360,struggles_inc,"Aug 27, 2024 at 8:10 AM","I can try to give context. This client is an author who published their first book this year, with the printing business I already worked with before. Since there have been previous contracts with the publisher, we took this author's book for a campaign as well.

I assume he was in-between two companies, his personal decisions regarding the campaign meant less than his publisher's, and didn't like it, idk honestly. Anyway, I had to work directly with him because I needed the material for advertising. So we talked a lot, met irl, and he was very negative all the time. I know it's just my perspective, but it seemed like he didn't care for the campaign at all when we were doing our first interview. My point turned out to be true when he decided to change the campaign goal mid process, much to the publisher's dissatisfaction. Basically, this means that we had to remake a lot of stuff because he initially didn't pay attention.

Then there was this thing with the comments he made. He cussed all the time, and, when shown something he didn't like, he would reply ""total shit"" without elaborating. I had to guess what was wrong.

I don't know why he didn't cut collaboration with me by himself. Maybe the publisher pushed him to continue, and he was just taking it out on me. Anyway, I wrote him today to tell that there will be no further marketing for his book. Hopefully, I won't lose contact with the publisher on other authors they have, but I am just completely exhausted.

My company is not really like a media corporation, I can't just push this guy to other department, away from my view. I don't have enough fuck-you money for that. So I had to deal with him sometimes, even after I hired a person who usually talks to authors.

I guess that's the whole story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Did I ask for too much?,2647565,Grumble,"Aug 27, 2024 at 12:10 PM","First of all, the client sounds like a jackass. Good riddance. And good luck to whoever has to deal with him next.

But about this colleague. Is ""colleague"" the best word here? I feel like ""my employee"" would be a better way to refer to a subordinate in this situation?

If you asked him to do this on your behalf and gave him the option of declining, then it was certainly his prerogative to decline. Whether or not it was disrespectful (out of line), I think, would depend on his tone and body language. What you've written here... On the surface, it sounds like he disrespected you. However, it depends on the overall tone of the conversation. And, to an extent, whether what you asked of him falls within his job responsibilities. I'd also consider the quality of your professional relationship: Are you guys good with each other? Do you value his work? Do you respect him as an employee? Do you feel respected by him as his boss? Do you trust him?

An employee and their boss owe each other a fundamental level of respect.

Every business needs leadership. Every business with employees has a hierarchy that must be respected and preserved, otherwise the whole thing can come crumbling down.

You are providing your employees with the money they need to live. Give yourself permission to assert yourself with them. If you're having trouble doing this, something you could do is envision yourself in their position and think about how you would want to be told something. What if you were the employee and someone else was the boss? What would be acceptable? What would be unacceptable?

You say you're not a bossy person. But is what you want to communicate to your employees actually being ""bossy""? Or is it just normal, everyday professional communication? Switch positions with them in your mind, and maybe you'll see that you're not being so ""bossy"" after all.",2647299,2647299,,,,,,,,,,,
Did I ask for too much?,2647617,struggles_inc,"Aug 27, 2024 at 1:09 PM","I… guess you're right. I'll have to think about that. The thing is, even though they are employees, I think of them as colleagues due to the fact that most of them have more job experience than me and/or are older. Idk it's just weird to me to refer to them as someone on a lower position. But I understand where you're coming from.

Regarding boss-employee relationships, I've been on both sides. I mean that I saw toxic people in management, encountered those who tried to work their employees to death and so on. I learned from that before I started my own company.

This particular employee is a close one, at least from my perspective. We basically started together. They have been included in the project with that client but then switched to another one. So that was really just a request, not something they actually had to do. I don't think I am allowed to be assertive in situations like that, and the problem for me is not they refused. Literally had the right to. It's how hostile the response was, seemingly out of nowhere. I talked to them today, about a different topic though, and everything was back to usual. Laid-back, calm, respectful. Idk where that response came from, since I'm not requesting help (aka extra work) on a regular basis.

Maybe they got annoyed I didn't deal with that situation myself. Since a lot of trusted people in my company have more experiences in various fields I'm hardly familiar with, some are way more competent than I am. They also have kind of an assertive style in sales and client management, that's partially the reason we had this publishing client on our side, and maybe they were disappointed that I was too soft. I'm not mad at them, mostly upset and kinda mad at myself.

Did I ask for too much?,2647709,Grumble,"Aug 27, 2024 at 2:31 PM","Your self-criticism and feelings of sadness are very apparent in what you've written here. It's so apparent, in fact, that I am feeling it too. I can literally feel the sadness in your words in this thread. While I can usually get some understanding about what/how somebody is feeling when I read posts on this forum, I don't usually absorb what they're feeling, myself.

So, what I was trying to get at here was to sort of... nudge you or encourage you to go a little easier on yourself and to allow yourself a little more leeway. To your topic question, ""Did I ask for too much?"" My immediate, initial reaction to that was, ""Hell no!!"" And this extra context only reinforces that.

For whatever it's worth, you sound like an empathetic, kind, considerate boss. I would work for somebody like you in a heartbeat. I wish you the very best in navigating your role in this company.",2647617,,,,,,,,,,,,

After basically not leaving the house for about two weeks, I started going back to work/school last week. Doing that was important for staying employed, so I somehow managed to overcome my lethargy.
Also I started school with a new class, which was really hard to do because I'm already afraid of school if I know the people there. My class is actually nicer than I anticipated.
Everything seems to be getting better on the surface, but I don't feel like anything has meaningfully changed. I still contemplate death every day.
Every time I think about my life I feel physically sick.

This is just a microcosm of a bigger pattern that shows up everywhere in my life.

I started transitioning about two years ago and thought that I might start to love myself. Or maybe start to feel okay in the body I inhabit. Or maybe just feel a little bit less bad all the time.
Also I moved out of my mother's place and now live with my loving partner.
All things considered, a lot of stuff in my life is going great.

That my experience of life still consists mostly of feeling depressed, anxious and lonely just proves to me that I'm incapable of being happy.

I would buy another shotgun shells with lead birdshot load or the shot/load itself and then I would (because I am quite experienced in casting under home conditions using investment casing method) create a 3D model of the 00 buckshot pellets (which are just a round balls with 8,38 diameter basically) and print them on my 3D printer. Then I would create a casting tree, like is in this picture:

and pour an investment onto it. After the burnout process I would melt the acquired lead birdshot and pour it into the mold (under the vacuum of course). And there we have it! Nice round 00 buckshot pellets.
I know it may sound like very long and difficult process but well, this is the only avaible option that comes to my mind right now.
And slug? It perhaps has a better penetration force but I am comfortable with 00 buckshot honestly.

Two roads diverged . . .,2646912,Danby,"Aug 26, 2024 at 9:36 PM","Posting here because this forum is the only place I can talk about these things--I have no one to confide in, and while I do have a blog, this sort of thing really shouldn't go there, it being devoted to gaming, model building, and sports.

At any rate, I find myself at a crossroads in my life. My wife of nearly thirty years is divorcing me. I think I've come to terms with that; we both agree she is a major source of my anxiety and sadness. So far it's been amicable; we're separated but still living together as a) neither of us can afford to move out and b) I'll be damned if I'll leave my games, books, and planes behind; I'm the one who pays the effing mortgage. The plan is to sell the house once our youngest finishes college and moves out early next year, then we split the proceeds, pay off our pretty substantial debts, and go our separate ways.

So the one road goes off into the unknown, to a new life, which has me scared. I don't know where I'll be this time next year, or if I'll even be here. My soon-to-be-ex thinks I should look on it as a great adventure. In addition to suffering from depression, I'm autistic; I take comfort in routine as protection from a shitty world. This whole process is ending my world as I know it, and I do NOT like or do well with change.

There's also the logistical headache. You never know how much crap you have until you have to pack it up and move it. I sit here and type this in my mancave/dungeon under the house, and look around at my games, books, airplanes, other stuff, and wonder ""how the f*ck am I going to pack all this up and move it?"" And will it fit in a new place? Will I have to get a storage unit? And where will the new place be? Should I stay here in the SF Bay Area, my home (I am a native)? Move to near my mother and youngest sister and best friend from grad school in Virginia? If I do that, how do I get my things there? It's adding to my stress and anxiety and depression all at once.

And there's the worry of finding someone again. My soon-to-be-ex was my first serious girlfriend. I've never been popular with the opposite sex; women don't think of me in that way for some reason (I do have quite a few female friends). We met at a History Honors Society conference; we were both presenting papers. She invited me up to Berkeley to go book shopping; 30+ years and two kids later, here we are. She always supported and accepted my geeky hobbies and the eccentricities that go with my autism; I worry a lot about finding someone like that again. I don't want to be alone; I feel alone, even now. I even joined eharmony to kind of ""get out there"" but that so far has been a huge waste of time and money.

I think about ctb (the other road) a lot now . . . it started with our financial difficulties and got heightened by the impending end of my life as I know it. I'm tired of fighting . . . I'm tired of being sad and depressed all the time . . . I'm tired of worrying . . . I'm tired of being lonely. My hobbies don't make me happy any more; sometimes they seem like chores. I try to spend some family time, but that makes me sad as I know it's going away. I have a shotgun (California compliant even--it's hard to get guns in this bluest of blue states) and shells in my shopping cart at an online gun store; I just need to finish checking out and the countdown starts. I have to go get it at a local store, and I have no intention of bringing it--or me--home. I haven't quite gotten there yet . . . but I fear I will soon.

I've been a lurker on this forum for a few years but never created an account. Recently, I decided that I will go through with my plans either this or next year. I'd like to share all the information I've discovered while browsing this forum with everyone who is struggling or has questions. Today, I picked up my SN and tested its purity, which turned out to be very high at 98%+ (which is good!). I would like to make this thread a Q&A about my journey, history, and knowledge on various topics. Please feel free to ask me anything, and I will do my best to respond to everyone. I want to thank the entire community in advance for making this forum such a nice and peaceful place.

Hopefully, I can help you as much as you have helped me.

People use antiemetics and fasting to minimize the possibility of vomiting. Both are strongly recommended for this reason. If you have high purity SN, use the correct dosage (25g for under 100kg), and can keep it down without vomiting, it will work.

(Q&A) Got my SN and tested its purity,2643356,Boundless,"Aug 23, 2024 at 6:23 PM","Hey. I like the subtitle you have under your name. What I'm about to say might sound harsh, but I believe it's true: if you're afraid of death, you're not ready to go. You need to fully and deeply understand the decision you're making and what it involves. This isn't a choice that should be made emotionally or impulsively.

I used to fear death and suicide as well. I spent years researching death, nature, religions, philosophies, biology, physics, math—you name it. I was desperate to understand this universe and the world around me. Despite all my efforts, I never fully understood why things happen the way they do. I couldn't understand other people's actions and behaviors, or where suffering in the world comes from. I spent thousands of hours studying various topics in depth, trying to find answers. About two years ago, I finally found my answers.

When I found my answers, my fear of death vanished. I no longer feared God(s), other humans, or other situations. I concluded that fear is driven by the unknown—we fear what we don't understand. So I sought answers to the things I didn't know or understood. My last questions were: why is there life? Why is there something rather than nothing? Why do I perceive and experience things the way I do? And my final question: what is infinity?

Many PhD physicists, scientists, and philosophers have debated these questions throughout their lives. I've read much of their work, but none gave a satisfactory answer. Some, like Nietzsche, Diogenes, and Taoism, came close, but none truly nailed it in my humble opinion. After spending so much time on these questions, it eventually all clicked for me. The whole world suddenly made sense. I understood the ""eternal why,"" and everything fell into place. This realization completely eradicated my fear of anything.

I'm still alive today because I want to test some theories and experience a few things. Once I've done that, I will end my life, without fear or regret. Hope this answers your question.",2643309,,,,,,,,,,,,

You sound like you've reached enlightenment. Good for you Is it as good as they promised?

I like to tell myself that I do not fear death or being dead, but rather the process of dying. I like to think that if I knew everything would be as smooth as pudding, then I'd be able to do it without a second thought.

Although, the hesitation of the past couple of weeks has made me think that maybe, indeed, I am not ready to go. But what the duck am I waiting for? Life is only going to get worse from here.

I guess we're both here for different reasons.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
(Q&A) Got my SN and tested its purity,2643778,Boundless,"Aug 24, 2024 at 6:07 AM","I believe many people fear the process of dying because of the significant unknowns it involves. They worry about potential complications, what will happen to their bodies, the future, and their loved ones etc. What I have done is completely letting go of this way of thinking.

In my experience, successful suicides occur due to the following reasons:
- A person's pain, whether mental, physical, or both, becomes unbearable. In this state, the intensity of their pain allows them to bypass the barrier of fear.
- Individuals who engage in deep introspection and overcome their fear by thoroughly understanding it.
- Those who do not fear suicide because of their religious (or other) beliefs or spiritual convictions.

You may suffer, but if that pain isn't enough to break through the barrier of fear, you will never go through with it.

You can engage in self-reflection as much as you like, but without a deep understanding of yourself and the world, you will never take the final step.

You may hold religious or other beliefs, but unless you are a true believer to the very core, you won't follow through till the end.


In response to your statement, ""Life is only going to get worse from here,"" I would say this: suffering only exists in your mind. It originates from within, not from outside.",2643442,,,,,,,,,,,,

So I think I will wait until things get bad again, as I'm sure they will.

2024 was unbelievable. 2023 was unbelievably good and intense. 2024 was horrible, didn't have a week to be with the most loving, empathic and so many other things.

suicidal thoughts started 14, not too much to worry (maybe?). at 19 it became a serious thing and since then till my 23s it has been depression and some little more.

Let's talk about harassment towards a SaSu member.,2176906,RainAndSadness,"Sep 30, 2023 at 12:52 PM","Hello everyone.

As some of you know, there are a bunch of people out there on Twitter, campaigning to get this forum shut down - without much success, of course. We're still here and we just recently had our five years anniversary, which is amazing and I'm confident we will stay around for a long time. I'm not concerned about this forum at the moment. The fixers tried to make access to this forum for UK members more difficult with the Online Safety Bill which was supposed to criminalise ""legal but harmful"" content and they hoped the ""Stop Online Suicide Assistance Forum Act"" would move forward, neither of that happened. And the people who celebrated the recent passing of the Online Safety Bill as a game changer despite its harmful effect on free speech and internet safety seem to underestimate the role of VPNs in this entire conversation, as there is a documented direct link between censorship and a surge in VPN usage. Their problem is, they have exhausted all options at this point and there aren't any legal angles left to take down this forum. Sure, they can hope for more articles and more Youtube videos about us, which will only make the forum more popular anyway, as I've outlined here. Their strategy so far clearly hasn't worked.

That's why they're resorting to personal harassement now, they know intimidating people who run this forum into submission is the only realistic way to get rid of this forum. And they know they can achieve that for example if they dox me. That was the goal of the NYT coverage back in 2021, in which the founders of this forum were the main subject of the article and intimidation was a huge factor of that hit piece. They had partial success and achieved their goal because the founders stepped down shorty after but the forum is still here because I'm still here. And that's a problem for the people who oppose this forum. So the fixers are trying to repeat that incident from 2021, this time targeting me in hopes I would step down because I'm the one running this community now. There is just one problem. They don't know who I am but for some reason, they think they do. And that's the point of this thread.

Now, what does that mean. Here are some examples. These following attachements are screenshots of Tweets from someone who is very obsessed with my identity, making lowkey threats into my direction. She has been doing that for a long time. Her Twitter account has since been deleted but the threats made in these Tweets still remain relevant to this day and I'll explain why in a bit. She made very clear in these Tweets that she thinks I'm a 50 years old trans-woman from New Mexico whose initials are ""TAF"", who has children and according to Catherine, is using donations to fund gender-affirming surgeries. Obviously, all these claims are false but let's go through these Tweets one by one.

Here she claims I'm 50 years old and that I live in New Mexico. That's not where I live and I'm not nearly 50 years old. I'm still in my twenties and I never made a big secret out of my age, the people who have known me for a bit longer can confirm these details aren't true.



Here is an example of them mentioning initials of what's supposed to be my name, ""TAF"". It's not my name nor do these initials resemble my real name.



Here she mentions me again, talking about children I'm supposed to have. There is just one problem. I don't have children and nothing is going to change that. I'm an anti-natalist, not just in theory but also in practice. I would never give up my freedom for offspring and since I'm a a trans woman who can't give birth, children are not an option. It's not that complicated.



And here she threatens to publish my face all over Twitter. Except it's not my face, it's the face of an innocent third party who for some reason got dragged into all of this because the fixers are unable and unwilling to fact-check their own accusations towards me but I'll explain that in a bit.



And in this Tweet Catherine claims donations are used to fund my surgeries.



First of all, no, donations aren't used to fund surgeries and I'm not sure why you believe I had ""gender reassignment surgery"". I never said I did and I don't see why that's anyone's business. What I can say is that all my trans-related surgeries and procedures so far were covered by insurance, all of them. It's simple, I live in a country where this type of medical procedure is covered by basic health insurance. Crazy, right? Well, that happens when you live in a civilized country. I could of course prove all of that in a court of law, there are health care documents which prove my health insurance paid for every single dollar of these treatments. But that's never going to happen because we'll never see each other in such a scenario, where I would have to defend myself in a court, as this website clearly isn't illegal and I haven't committed any crimes. Again, there wouldn't have been a bill to make this forum illegal if this forum was illegal but I guess logic isn't the fixers' strength either. But the point is, I never had to pay for any surgery out of my own pocket, which means none of the donations were necessary to cover for any of them. The donations, all of them, go straight to the forum - for some reason these people forget that running a forum costs money too and as long as the donations cover the costs of the forum, there is nothing shady about that. You can also fact-check for yourself that the donations we have received so far simply aren't enough to cover very complicated and extensive trans-affirming surgeries, they're tens of thousands of dollars. The people who oppose this forum simply want to make me look like the bad guy, and trying to do that by spreading doubt among community members about the authencity of me as a person. As I said, all conventional options to take down this forum have been exhausted, without much success so everything that might make it more difficult to run this forum is the next step and that includes slander and lies to sabotage this community and in this particular incoming donations. They're the fuel the forum is running on.

Now, let's get to the most important question. Why am I responding to these accusations? Well, first of all it affects an innocent person, a real person - namely the person that is attacked in these screenshots and that's not me. That person exists. Yeah, these threats are meant to go into my direction but they're not actually hurting me, they're hurting an innocent person that has done nothing wrong. I know who they're referring to, by the way. The person they think to be me has been a member of our community for a long time and I'm not going to mention their name to protect their privacy because unlike the fixers, I don't dox people. I respect the privacy fo anyone who wishes to remain anonymous and that's the big difference between me and them. So that's why I had to create this response in consideration of the privacy of the person that's been targeted in these Tweets and that's why I'm not going to dive into any further details about that person. But that person is real and they're victim of this targeted harassment. And I've reached out to the victim of this harassment and I've talked to them about this entire situation and this post has been created with the approval of said person - just to make that clear.

Kelli just recently made the following announcement and I'm worried they'll go after this person again - and this time it will get even worse. So that's why I'm posting this thread now, to signalize that's not me. And if they continue to harass said person, it will be clear that they're doing that despite my best attempts to stop them and despite the very high chance that they're harming someone else, ignoring potential collateral damage. I can also assure that any violations of my right to privacy would be handled very differently, certainly not in a thread like this because there are other means to defend myself. All I can do right now, in this particular case, is speak out and make sure it's understood that this isn't me. And what's what I'm doing with this thread, I'm not going to be silent anymore when these people act like absolute assholes, I made that clear when Tantacrul posted his video, implying I'm the one who is harassing anyone.



And while we're talking about Kelli, this is a good moment to remind everyone that she has doxxed members of our community as well. The more you dig into this anti-choice cult, the more you realize that they're absolutely vicious and they don't care if their actions are the final push that makes someone commit suicide. Again, the targets of their harassment are struggling SaSu members, which they claim are so vulnerable they need to be ""protected"" from ""harmful online content"" with the Online Safety Bill. And it doesn't really make sense for people who claim to be pro-life to act like this. Members of our community are already suffering enough and they don't need this bullshit. Leave them alone.
And these are the same few people by the way who also control the narrative through intense interaction with the journalists who write all these anti-SaSu hit pieces, just saying. Maybe that gives you some insight as to why the reputation of our forum is horrible.

Now. Of course I can't prove that I'm not 50 years old and living in New Mexico without actually revealing my own identity but I don't think that's even necessary. None of their claims are substantiated even with a hint of evidence, so I don't think I need to explain myself. The sole purpose of this thread is to stand up for the victim of this abuse, make clear that's not me and also make clear that these people alone bear the consequences of their actions. That's it. The burden of proof lies on these predators to back up their absurd claims that I've been a completely different person all along, it's not my job to debunk any of that. But I made clear now that these people are targeting the wrong person and that's enough in my opinion. The only thing we share is the fact that we're both trans and maybe that's why they think we're the same person. Maybe they think the probability that there are two trans people on SaSu is so small that I have to be that person but here is a reality check - we have a shitload of trans people in this community so that alone isn't really evidence.

And look, technically I couldn't care less if they go after someone else - it adds a layer of protection for me, simply because it means people are looking in the wrong places to uncover my identity, right? Sure but I don't like that they're going after innocent people. That's another difference between the fixers and me. They love to lash out to suicidal people and make them feel more miserable, I don't. And that's the only reason why I'm responding to these accusations, because it's simply absolutely disgusting to harass and intimidate someone who has absolutely nothing to do with the operation of this forum. It's a shame they're dragging a third party into this but their actions have tremendous collateral damage. As I've said above, they doxxed people in the past and they've harassed members of our community to the point of suicide, this isn't the first time they act like predatory assholes. And look, I'm also not going to simply ignore the fact that someone of my communities has been attacked. This is a member of SaSu and a member of the trans community, both are communities I appreciate dearly so I'm definitely going to call out nasty bullshit when I see it.

I'm also responding to this predatory behavior because it affects my reputation too. They're claiming I'm a completely different person when I've never been deceptive about who I am. My story and my background has been consistent throughout the years. From 2018 to 2023 I've never changed my story once because I've been sincere and open about who I am. Everything I said about myself has been the truth, the people in my team know that and people who are my friends do so as well.

So let me address these accusations here for the last time.





No Angela, you obviously don't know who I am. Given what you've tweeted in the last few months, you have no idea - all you did is harm an innocent person. There is a good chance you'll never find out who I am and that's a good thing. As a law-abiding citizen I have a right to privacy, it's that simple. And I have erased any tracks to sensitive information long before I became a member of this forum. So yeah, good luck finding any crumbles that lead to my identity. I wouldn't run this forum and expose myself to potential harm if I had massive online foodprint, don't you think? If there was information out there about my specific location, family members, my full name or when I was born (as you think that's my information), I wouldn't be in this position right now. I mean, that's pretty obvious. And I can also assure you that leaking any confidental information about the person you're targeting in these Tweets isn't going to end the forum's existence. Even if it was my information, it wouldn't, just to make that clear.

I've said it in the past and I'm going to say it again. These people are predators and they are preying on suicidal people under the disguise and with the justification of being 'grieving parents'. That's literally all they do. These screenshots are clear evidence for their disgusting behavior and it gets worse when you look at their long and extensive history of abuse towards members of our forum, the person that's been targeted in these Tweets isn't the only member that's been on the receiving end of their harassmentt, quite a few members could tell stories if they still were alive. But I might pick that up in the future and dedicate an entire thread to all the harassment they've done throughout the years. I have the receipts. I can tell the stories. And I'm done looking the other way. These predators need to get exposed, period.

Oh, and if you think what you've seen in these Tweets was bad, here is a little secret. I have intentionally left out more evidence that proves that they have been stalking the victim in this case and posting pictures of her too but as I said, I'm only posting evidence in this thread that protects the privacy of said person and that's why you only see a selected amount of Tweets, which don't contain identifying information. But it's a lot worse than this, let me tell you that. This entire thread only provides a small insight into the depraved behavior of these predators.

So yeah. I've planned this thread for a while but the due to the high chance they might lash out at an some random trans woman again, I felt the need to address the situation as quickly as possible. I hope they'll finally move on. I hope they'll seek therapy because they really need it, let's be honest. They think harming other will compensate for their pain of their loss but that's not how you heal. I've been through grief myself and that's not how I processed my emotions. And sincere question, do you see good actors in these Tweets? I don't. This here isn't the right way to go about it and I hope someday they will realize they have completely lost the plot. What started as activism to raise awareness about a forum back in 2019 has ended in targeted harassment towards suicidal individuals with the goal to ruin their lives, simply because the forum they've tried to deplatform is still up after all these years. Maybe sometimes it's better to take the L on a certain subject (because we're not going anywhere) than to end up being exposed as a predator on this forum. Just some food for thought.

It's a really unpleasant subject but it's important to talk about this. Thanks for your attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But ignoring them hasn't really played into our favor, right? It gave them the freedom to harass our members without being held accountable and it also gave them control over the narrative around this forum. I think it's important to deconstruct what they say, especially when they attack innocent members of our forum. And in this particular case they've been targeting one specific member because they think that's me - for whatever reason, I still don't get. And with this thread I actually gave them the chance to either double down or backtrack but given their response to my thread has been a single 'fuck off' - which is is to be expected from malicious actors who don't want to explain anything and rather focus on harassment instead, confirming what I said about them being predators - it seems they have decided to double down. They could have explained themselves, apologized, anything. But it seems they're so convinced that I'm a particular person that's been on their radar for a very long time that all ratio has been thrown out the window. There are no excuses anymore after this thread, I made very clear they're harming the wrong person and they will have to face the consequences for their actions if they continue to harass that person. I mean, it's very simple - why would I bring attention to these Tweets if they contained accurate information about who I am? It's silly. And again, there are member in our forum that can confirm that none of the information in these Tweets refer to me in any way. Everyone in my team knows that.

It's appreciated and I'm glad the forum provides a safe space to discuss your most personal thoughts and struggles and we try our best to keep this forum up and running - despite all attempts to make us disappear.

It's about being a kind of ""white knight"" and having the moral high ground as they cause collateral damage. These kinds of people only make things worse, and what's worse, normies and society at large will treat them as heroes even if their harassment, DOXing, and other activities pushes more people to suicide then shutting this forum could possibly prevent.

I really hate this world at times. Instead of improving it, the ""solution"" to suicide is typically drugs and manipulation/gaslighting to keep people just alive.

WTF this is the kinds of people who ""care about you""?!!? Honestly, this really proves my point. They don't want you to ctb, until they don't like you then they're suddenly LTG.

Has anyone tried to buy SN recently on that one spanish website that sells laboratory equipment ? If so, did they ask you to provide a company number to validate the order ?

Looking for Advice/Information on Legal VSED with Hospice Help,2645815,WearyWanderer,"Aug 26, 2024 at 12:56 AM","I may have the ability to be eligible for VSED and hospice after beginning the first couple of days on my own.

However, I definitely have some concerns and this method was never my first choice.

It's looking like my possible only choice though at this point.


Does anyone on the forum happen to know of VSED cases like Christina Symanski, where the patient was fairly young and suffering from spinal issues/pain but was able to endure the process.

I'm worried because I have some odd reactions to morphine which is the painkiller they use. It causes me intense head pressure like my brain and ears are going to explode and pop, the sensation that my legs are 100 pounds and I can't physically lift them, hypnagogic jerks possibly, an extremely uncomfortable dampening sensation in my brain (this is probably partly due to my ventriculomegaly so when the morphine went into my spinal fluid it also went into my brain).

I'm also hypoglycemic and get weak and faint after even just a few hours of not eating and drinking enough. According to one volunteer, this can be a good thing because she thought I would pass out and not be fully conscious of everything but I'm honestly not so sure.

My incredibly severe nervous system sensitivity has never fucking been an advantage in life only a terrible curse in all other circumstances.

I've seen accounts here of people who attempted VSED but without oversight and who vomited or had seizures. Both those symptoms sound unbearable to me in my already weakened, bedbound state but with my luck I would likely develop them. Does anyone know if there's natural ways to prevent this from happening or if maybe the reason Christina Symanski ended up drinking part of the time during her process was because that was the only way she could make it bearable?

Yes, two months is an excruciating amount of time but if it was the difference between pushing through the discomfort and symptoms and going a bit longer vs feeling forced to stop early due to say agitation and deliriium from no water then I can understand her reasoning and there must have been a reason why she ended up doing it that way I would think.

Any insights or advice on situations similar to this are greatly encouraged and appreciated.

Based on my descriptions and the fact that I have connective tissue disorder, med sensitivities, naturally low blood pressure, genetically weak and defective nervous system, current Candida overgrowth, long term antibiotic neurotoxicity and brain damage, possible long COVID side effects masked by numbness, extreme proneness to UTI, do you think I could still be a VSED candidate?

Supposedly the answer is yes based on the person I spoke with but I have a bad feeling about it and would hate to go through all the effort of setting it up and possibly getting worse then having to bail halfway through or something.

It's so fucking unfair because even with this legal method I feel like you honestly have to have some level of strength and function in order to be able to complete it and it's not a viable option for extreme cases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Looking for Advice/Information on Legal VSED with Hospice Help,2645915,trs,"Aug 26, 2024 at 3:27 AM","Assuming your situation is in the US (but if you're in a different country it may not apply), Hospice eligibility is standardly for patients with 6 months or less left to live (hospice will only last that long before the service is terminated) and is determined by a doctor. Because it requires approval via one's insurance it's fairly standard, strict criteria that cannot be deviated from. I know from personal experience. It doesn't sound like you have a rapidly terminal condition or diagnosis. Have they diagnosed you as less than 6 months to live? If not, I'm fairly certain you are not eligible, and I'm interested in knowing who said you ""may be eligible""? Those in hospice may choose VSED (although people rarely do), and in that situation you could use morphine for the horrible symptoms VSED causes until one passes. Anyone can do VSED even if not in hospice, but you would likely not have access to morphine or any other drug which could mitigate what happens when your organs progressively fail. And they are horrible symptoms to experience without medication, on top of already suffering from what one is already physically suffering, so I'd never want to do it outside of a palliative setting.
(by the way, I have every symptom and illness you mention, on top of a lot more ""official"" diagnoses that cause even worse progressive disability, and I am not even close to being considered terminal; the criteria is very narrow and requires specific diagnoses and test results).",2645815,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I started seriously wanting to starting in middle school and it's gone up and down since then, with the past couple months being the worst (best?) it's ever been. Usually in the past it was a more abstract misery and depression, but this time I have been thinking more clearly. Although it was set off by a traumatic, extremely emotional event, it made me realize a lot of things about myself and the world.

, I remembered the beautiful days when I was happy with him, I was very comfortable with him,

I have 1200 friends on Snapchat There is no one like him. ""Leave him and find someone else."" I have not found anyone like him and I think I will never find anyone like him.

His way of talking, his thinking, his eyes, everything about him was beautiful.

Unfortunately, we left each other. I deleted him from Snapchat because he didn't want to risk leaving his country and living with me, and because he had previously left me to rot alone and wasn't with me.

What if I get sick or break my leg who will be with me? He left me before and probably will leave me later. He's not a good person for me to depend on and live my life with, but a big part of my heart is telling me to go back and add him on Snapchat

I will try my best to bring him with me but he doesn't want to move at all, if he doesn't want to move then we are not together we are far apart ،my mind is in shock because it doesn't comprehend and I deleted my ex because it hurts!!

I've told my parents, a handful of therapists, my psychiatrist, and two of my close(now deceased :( friends). I don't want to improve. It's not that I don't know how to(at least roughly). It's not that I don't have the energy to. It's that ultimately, my belief is that regardless of improvement, the ingrained nihilism and self awareness that has existed for the past 10-12 years of my experience on this earth has made it so that regardless my suffering will be present. I have learned to hate existence, and to believe(understand) sentience is suffering. My ideal petty suicide unironically would be at the peak of my life, where my family would assume I'm better and happy, just out of complete spite and disregard for happiness and life to prove a point that I care not for improvement and am self destined for an early death.

As for the fear thing, that reminds me of my friend, who couldn't go through with her attempt and at least currently has been changed by her failed SN attempt to at least temporarily cling to life. But more common than her is that despite your fear, when the time comes, and you are completely out of willpower to live, your survival instincts will be overcome and you will pass. It's not so much that you beat the fear, but just accept it, and disregard or push through it. It might linger even after swallowing, but if you're dedicated to death, you will die, even if it takes multiple tries. So dont stress the fear, if your mind is as made up as it sounds, you will be fine in due time.

I've to die so my family could get the insurance, they'll at least have the chance to buy themselves a better live.

Being awake is painful, sleeping - with bad dreams and nightmares - is no better. There is no break from the constant awfulness.

I can't see, no matter how hard I try, the worth for future for me. Life will consist of what it has consisted of for the past 10+ years..getting up, working at yet another job, being behind on bills most of the time because I end up job hopping so much due to the anxiety and depression that are ever present. Yes, I've tried therapy, yoga, praying, medications, journaling, etc - some of it helped for a bit, most did nothing. I am tired. Physically, emotionally, spiritually spent. There is nothing left.

This morning I start a new job - I am not looking forward to it, but then I don't look forward to anything. I have no idea what number this job will be - over 50 but less than 100 I've had since 2009 when everything in my life went off the rails. I've never been able to get my life back on track. I'm not an addict or alcoholic, my demons are all emotional - life long depress, anxiety, self doubt, shame.. which all became expoentially worse when the stability I had in my life died.

JD Souther, a musician, sings a beautiful song "" When You're Only Lonely"" I pulled it up on youtube earlier - and sobbed. I hardly ever cry and rarely sob, but a short time ago I did. For myself, for everyone on this forum who is suffering and wishing we all could just find peace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunly, i have to suffer, at least for a little while longer.

I am so tired of living in the past, at least in my minds eye, but don't know how to not think about it almost all the time. IF the present or future were even half of what my life use to be, I could handle it better, look forward to more days,weeks,months or even years. But every day I feel like an ungrateful asshole because all think about is what I am living without - the people & places that brought me joy, stability, happiness - are all gone. Each day has become harder to navigate, even simple daily task of living. Yes, some is depression but mostly, it's a giving up that I have not felt before.

Other days i just cry for me, because the past few months i thought everything was better; i got really good grades, i made friends, i improved my relationship with my parents. I wasn't feeling alone or sad anymore, so i stopped being hopeless. i realized i don't wanna die. the thing is that i found out recently that it doesn't matter how hard i try to be better, or how everything seems to be, it's everything false. it will never be better, the life i was born with. the world and people is still fucked up and I'm stuck in it and with them.

I hate myself that we talked about it, but her first attempt which failed she described it positively, almost as if she was in bliss from lack of air until the rope broke. Crazy fucking bastard.

That said drowning seems harder to pull off. You would need to do a little more than inhale a full breath of water, and you would feel that shit in your lungs especially if salt water.

I appreciate you sharing though - this is reassuring to hear. I've heard a few other people who have had similar positive experiences. That would be a perfect way to go wouldn't it?

I've been trying to get used to the feeling of the rope tightening around the top of my neck, but when I pull it tight it makes me gag. I'm not sure if I have a strong gag reflex or if it's SI kicking in, but it's annoying & uncomfortable! (I'm certain the rope is in the right spot - nice and high for full suspension hanging).
I wonder if I'll be less likely to gag when I'm full weight is hung.
I worry that the gagging is moving the rope & therefore may reduce the pressure on the carotids.

It takes a tremendous amount of self awareness to commit suicide, especially without immediate distress. So the argument is that while animals can exhibit behaviors that might seem like suicide, these actions are often attributed to immediate distress from environmental factors rather than deliberate, thought out intent. It just goes to show how strong one's will to commit suicide is, and also why I will always scoff whenever someone calls suicide the ""easy way or cowards way out"".

I was under the watchful eye of mental health team that was court ordered. After meeting a few times with the guy, I knew the lay of the land and how to respond to his questions.

I wish the very best to you and with that said, if they are fair and understanding then lay it all out in the open.

Also try and remember that if you have to meet with these folks in the future and if you tell a tall one now and they figure it out down the road, then they will in the future keep that in mind and it could have negative con sequences for you.

Like me, I did NOT like the psychiatrists that I had on one of my lock ups in the psych ward and she made it hell for me. This was the time that I had to go to court and fight from getting a long-term lockup. If they would catch on, if one tells a tall one or says nothing, then the psych ward trip might become more of a possibility.

Being honest also means that one does not have to try and remember what a person said to the other person that asked the question(s).

Self-harm usually isn't in of itself enough to warrant a trip to the psychward. Then again, this is based on my experience with talking to a crisis worker and psychiatrist within a hospital setting, so I have no clue as to whether or not this will apply to to your situation.

Since this is your first time self harming, I'm going to assume that it probably wasn't severe, so I'd imagine that the chances of you being hospitalized are low. Where did you cut anyway? Depending on where you cut it should be pretty easy to hide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm scared. There's so much I still want to do, so many little things that I just want to sit with - but I don't know how much longer I can do it. Everyone keeps telling me I'm 22 and I have my whole life ahead of me and have so much time but it feels like I can't go on anymore. I can't function like everyone else no matter how hard I try and every day is more and more exhaustion. Anxiety is eating me alive. I don't feel safe leaving my apartment. I don't feel safe in my own head. I want to go home but I don't even know where that is anymore.

I think it's just never dawned on me how scary it is to be so close to just...leaving? I want to give it one last chance, but I say that every time. Every time it gets better it gets worse again. It never stays stable. I'm tired of chasing. I'm tired of running. I don't know what to do. I don't know how I'd even do it. I don't want to die alone in this apartment but I can't go where I'd like to.

If I go who's going to take care of my stuffed animals. I don't want to leave them alone, not like that. It sounds so childish but I'm so scared and I just...I don't know what to do. I feel so alone in my own head and nothing is helping. Not the meds, not the therapy, not the exercise - even if it does for a little bit it never lasts. I wish I was just born normal. I wish the chemicals in my brain would just work like they're supposed to. Maybe I meant to just go. I don't know.

I grew up catholic and a lot of that trauma and fear and love has been creeping back into my life. My head is spinning. I hope God isn't angry at me for giving up. I really did try. I just want people to know that I really did try. I tried so so hard and I still feel like this and I'm sorry.

I really wanted to be an astronaut. I think thats what makes me the saddest. I had so many big dreams. So wishes that just died. I stopped volunteering at the aquarium because y mental health got so bad and now I missed the chance to go back. Those seals were the only thing saving me and they didn't even know. They're perfect.

I don't know anymore. I'm sorry this is very incoherent, I'm just very not okay right now. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm really sorry. I really don't do any of this on purpose.

(TW: homicidal thoughts) Does anyone here ever get homicidal thoughts alternative with suicidal ones?,2607183,Illegal Preclear,"Jul 23, 2024 at 6:31 PM","You know it's interesting. My stepmom said offhand a few weeks ago ""if you're suicidal, then you're homicidal."" Which isn't objectively true at all, but I stopped to think about it and added some nuance - if you are willing and desiring to die, it would be easier for you to commit a violent act IF that's already your intention. Another thing - I truly believe once you've crossed the threshold into wanting to die and death has been denied to you, it sickens the soul. Like you have an open wound left to fester and stew and it becomes infected, which can lead to violent thoughts. HOWEVER, once you add Psychiatry into the mix, and people who have attempted CTB or even voiced their desire to CTB are likely to become entangled with coercive Psychiatry and that's where the real problems start. Psych Drugs can absolutely rewire a person's brain to act out violently - no different than how bath salts can make a normal person want to chew someone's face off.

Some of the drugs Psychiatrists have forced me to take made me say such ugly things to people I would never dream of saying. Research school shooters! Most school shooters were on hard Psych drugs that obviously did not agree with them - and they were COERCED into taking them by either clueless parents or Psychiatrists looking to experiment without giving a damn about their wellbeing.

As for me personally - if I put the things I fantasize into writing ANYWHERE the cops will be knocking at my door waiting to haul me off to Psychiatrists, I've learned that good and well. Which is funny because a lot of those dark fantasies are centered around Psychiatrists and the kind of people who become them. Also my mother and sister. The things I've thought about doing to my mother and sister...

BUT - I would never act out on these fantasies. Because I know my CTB is imminent and while Karma is reversed on this Prison Planet and violent, evil actions will get you everywhere in this corner of existence, I truly don't know what penalties those actions carry after death. Maybe none, maybe after we die we fade into oblivion. But if we do have a chance to escape this Prison Planet after we die, it would be really, really stupid of me to muck everything up and rack up Karmic debt in my last couple months of life.


THIS. This is exactly right. And it's really a brilliant way to look at the act of killing. You think you're doing the worst thing you can to someone, but in reality you free a person from this Prison Planet and put yourself in lockdown both physically and Karmically. By killing, you only hurt yourself. Which makes perfect sense on a backwards Planet like this one.

@JustBeingHere377 I would suggest you write these feelings in a handwritten journal. Sketch violent pictures in it if you're so inclined. Take it out on the paper, and keep the journal to yourself. It's okay to have these fantasies. I have them too. But UNDERSTAND - the consequences of violent actions, at least for people in positions like ours, is never worth it. I don't know if you're planning on CTB soon, but think of it like this - CTB is getting released from this Prison Planet. Do you really want to muck things up by shanking someone in jail so close to your release?",2607123,,,,,,,,,,,,

You don't think about harming others until you've completely accepted being able to harm yourself and broken down your sense of self.

It would be Really difficult and complex to try to prove something like that but it's always something that I suspected. Maybe it's possible to do a survey with the people here but it's such a dark subject I don't know that I really want to bring it up or really see the immediate benefit.

Yeah I agree with you that your mom wasn't being objective about thinking suicidal people are also homicidal.

It's to make people fearful of Death so that you will never commit suicide so that you remain a slave and prisoner in this hell.

For me Death is the best thing that could happen to me

They also confuse people. They also hide that after Death is non-existence forever . It's not like they haven't been working on finding out what a human is , what life is for hundreds of years.

Making peace with death isn't easy, and it sure doesn't happen overnight. Who knows, maybe we get reborn, no one really has the answers. If we do, I hope in our next lives we both find the peace and happiness we missed out on

Here are a few things that helped me come to terms with death:
Studying philosophy and spirituality, like Alan Watts and his perspective on life and death
Realizing that everyone dies eventually anyway, so death is unavoidable
I'd rather die now while my body's still able to carry out the CTB. Later in life, I might not even get that chance
Having a CTB partner so I'm not facing it alone
My life story hasn't exactly been a fairytale, so it's okay to ""close the book"" and move on
Dying reduces my carbon footprint to zero, so at least I'm doing the planet a favour
There might be other things too, but this is what comes to mind for now. I hope this gives you some comfort :)

If you're jumping from one place on the ship to another that's all you'd need. If you were jumping in the water, you'd need to be a bit higher for the same effectiveness (not sure how high exactly, you'd have to research).

I believe jumping into water with a weight tied to you would be the best option. Drowning on it's own is second only to firearms in lethality. So, coupled with falling- even if you didn't die upon hitting the water, there's a decent chance you'd be unconscious while you drowned (which you would almost certainly not survive), and since you'd be sinking there'd be even less chance of medical attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I’m convinced that all jobs suck and work is begging people to do things that are not important,2646876,prototypian,"Aug 26, 2024 at 8:45 PM","Actually that's not entirely true. A very very tiny group of people have jobs and work that is fulfilling and they love. Everyone else has a horrible job even id you delude yourself into believing it's exactly what you want and it's challenging. Most jobs are one of three types;

1) doing tasks to decrease risk to the business. This could be paper work or justifications or audit and reconciliation. The only purpose of your work is to ensure the business you work for minimizes risk for whatever potential problem could occur. It's what bureaucracy actually does and why it exists.

2) engaging with people to get them to buy goods or services. The second type of job is the one that transacts or begs and rationalizes someone buying something.

3) the third is the type that actually makes things or performs services. Companies like to automate these processes to the point that you are graded on the order of tasks and quality control on how many perform widgets are created.

Sure there are surgeons or librarians or other things but let's face it, everything becomes routine and nothing in the world gets to avoid the bureaucracy.

Odds are the work you do for a living, and in our world we must work to live, will be one of these jobs and even though you can delude yourself into thinking it's important, when you really step back all you did was fill out paperwork and complete forms or sell products you get no benefit from or assemble stuff that will be sold independent of your effort.

when a collection of people come together, they need to produce resources to continue there existence, and the procurement of resources is an incredibly hard task that take large amounts of labour, and hard work. So when a society realises this, they then need an incentive structure, to, well incentivise the people to work toward the procurement of the needed resources. which in the past meant plain old slavery and forced labour, but as societies, became more wealthy and better of in terms of quantity and quality of their resources. then came a need for better incentives, for the workers, and so they made the resources themselves the incentives. so if you worked hard you would be fed and housed, and would be treated as an ""equal"". The main way to which they achieve this nowadays, is currency, literal paper that the government tells you is valuable, and can be traded for resources, but only if you first work towards the original purpose, and help society extract the needed resources. as to then be given access of this currency

all just for the continued existence, of societies that act like machines and which have no regard for the real human being placed within that machine. though the sad part is that, there is no system on planet earth of any economic structure, that actually benefits people, as though they are actual real people. just humans mindlessly trying to find an excuse to continue living when there no actual benefit to doing so.",2646878,,,,,,,,,,,,

First post here, I have joined awhile back in March but didn't had time to be on here often due to starting college and busy things. I don't know if this is allowed to talk about homocide or an act of violence on someone else on here since I don't see many people talk about this but I can't hold up my anger that I've been dealing with for the last three years. Just to reassure, I'm not a murderer or want to kill anybody at all. I'm 21M and I have been dealing with OCD and been getting repetitive negative thoughts that I've experienced in the past that traumatizes me even when I was a child. It definitely hurts emotionally and gives me pain in my chest and one thing that happened that I cannot let go was one of my high school teachers that I had. I had a math teacher who I really liked with her teaching but she was very strict and let me down and left me out almost everyday I've been with her. She didn't listen or understand me and made me feel neglected. Ever since I graduated, I cannot move on and that's me and I know it may seem like it's nothing but I make it into a bigger problem for myself. I started feeling revenge and getting mad at her for all the bad things she's done to me and was thinking about doing a revenge attack to send out a message of how bad she was and I know where she lives and what house but I keep saying to myself to move on and let go but I can't and that's why I'm here to get support. But what's more important is my suicidal thoughts. It all started when I was a freshman in high school back in 2018 and this was even before when I first met my math teacher, I was struggling and suffering in pain with how hard my education is and became a buildup of bullying and getting left out all the time and things did get better especially now that I'm in college but I know one day I might ctb if things for me don't get better sooner or later so I'm in desperate need of support. It has gotten worse from feeling down and suicidal to not being able to control myself with getting revenge on somebody else that hurted me and I don't want to kill or hurt anybody at all and mainly only want to ctb. I know this is kind of long but there's still a lot more that I want to cover but I'll put it in my future posts but just want to give an introduction on my feelings and thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Im so sorry you are dealing with such thoughts and struggling. Its a terrible feeling to struggle. Now this math teacher that was not so nice to you, obviously her actions were bad and she should have been better to you, no doubt about it but sometimes I like to think that we never really know what someone is going through. I deal with a chronic illness and it makes me so bitter and angry sometimes even though I am actually very a sweet and kind person. We don't know what might be going on in her personal life that made her so bitter or cruel. Although nothing justifies acting in that way, maybe we can give her a little bit of grace and maybe that might make it easier for you to understand why she might have been behaving that way. Mostly this is to ease your feelings about this teacher so that you don't hold on to this anger.

I agree, I know that I'm a rule follower and even if I attempt to do any violence or harming someone else that it will make it worse for me but my plan was to ctb right after so I wouldn't be suffering the consequences and ending up in jail time if I got caught which would be my worst nightmare. My father was abusive to me too, back when I was a child, my mom was taking care of me and had to take my dad to court for visitation rights and became stressful for her but she always supported me no matter what even today
I can somewhat agree with this. I am smart and always nice to everybody. And since I'm studying for college and pursuing my degree soon, I'm nowhere close to a criminal or break any laws and rules. I actually do know my teacher's personal life since I remember on the first day of school, she did a presentation to the class to get to know her and she does have a family like a husband and has children and she was pregnant when I was there so she obviously had another child being born, so I knew that her personal life was enjoyable for her but the thing that irritates me is her teaching life was different and don't understand why. I know I have a lot of explaining to do from start to finish as I'm trying to remember everything in my head that I can think of the mistakes that she did.",2646899,2646901,2646909,,,,,,,,,,

Keeping one's head on the track is apparently extremely scary and it vibrates/heats up as the train approaches. Also, getting torn apart by the train if you don't instantly die by the wheel would be very unpleasant to say the least. Not to mention the collateral damage.

mental health “advocacy” is a scam,2645295,nembutal,"Aug 25, 2024 at 2:17 PM","the walls in my high school were littered with suicide hotline posters and advocacy. i was part of a mental health awareness group where we would distribute knowledge on suicide statistics and bring attention to symptoms though art and speech. being surrounded by those with the same belief on empathy made me believe that the world was more caring than i had previously thought.

but now, in my worst moments of suicidality, i do not receive the care and attention that i advocated for others way back when. not a phone call nor text to confirm that i am still walking the earth. ""reach out"", they said, and i did, to everyone i thought was closest to me. nothing came of it, and i began to view my time as an advocate as time wasted.

where are these people, aside from professionals who are paid to care, who apparently care for the mentally ill more than other generations? does no one want to feel like a hero, does no one have time to spare? i can't get to the bottom of the hypocrisy of a mental health advocate who is now going through their own struggles and receiving no help from any direction.

most importantly, why do these people grieve and wish they ""could have done more"" after your death when they had countless of opportunities to do so, not to mention mounds of evidence of warning signs?

what id do to be white knighted. what id do for a mentor who'd place me under their wing. but i dont even ask for help in that depth. i just want a small semblance of care. evidence that i exist outside of the four walls of my bedroom. why wont anyone reach out? is there something intrinsically wrong with me?

I spent years of my life helping people with severe mental issues. I thought the systems in place were lacking so I created my own, tiny, system.

I don't know about others but, to me, I listened to so many stories, so many people poured their hearts onto me. I saw them grow, saw them decay, saw them die. Some stories I'll never forget...and, some events I'll also never forget.

Doing all that, for years, broke me in a way I never anticipated. I thought I had my boundaries well defined, that I could care deeply and be there for them and that once I was home I could close that door until the next day. I feel like I did it but now...I think all those years took a toll on me.

I loved helping others, I felt like it gave meaning to my life. There are people that got married because they met through the community I created during those years. Lots of people recovered, others not so much, one of them committed suicide and I'll forever wonder if I'm to blame.

I ended that service after 7 years. To this day I think about all those people. I really wanted to continue to do good but it was just so damn hard...I didn't earn anything from it. I paid money and used all my time to keep it alive. Also dealt with horrible people that threatened my life and the community and the police didn't do shit.

If those are the reasons please someone help me with the source I have to find a listing of fentanyl being sold with a higher purity.
And perhaps to identify a proper ROA (route of administration) as well.




p.s. this is how I administered IM in case there's a problem:
(for my IM I used 7 syringes in which I mixed 700mg of (unknown impurity) fentanyl into ~21m of water then drawn up through the syringes. each syringe had 3ml capacity and was filled to full with the F + water solution. mixed until no particles. had a greenish color in some syringes but others were clear but still having the F powder mixed in as well. stuck each syringe into my vastus lateralis thigh muscle and then pushed all the plungers at the same time. the vastus lateralis muscle is a huge thigh muscle (one of the largest in your body) used for walking so I don't know how I could have missed it.

I definitely would never wish i'd be any sentient creature as they can suffer immense pain. but i don't see any reason to exist at all because nothing matters . nothing matters to me except avoiding extreme pain. And i have a abhorrence to existence because i can't separate the things they tell us are so good from the most horrible things as they both part of the same world existence life .

plus i don't see much of a difference between me and a dog , both have a brain eyes, both eat food get hungry , can suffer extreme pain etc . the major difference is a dog can get Nembutal and i can't but still no reason to exist at all",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since if i were to become an animal i would not have a my own mind anymore. Its like too become an animal need us to die in the process. And if we dont and remember our self. Life would be all about survival. Only to be able to focus on finding food and staying away from foes. And if i were a cat. I would be awesome in the start. But it would be really boring. Surer you would probably have a owner that would care about you. But it would in the end be like a prison. yes you can go out but in the end you need food and water to survive. And you are stuck in the house you are in. So in my opinion even if i became an animal i would still end up suffering. Because life is unfair. And nothing will ever chance that.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since things are coming to a close for me I've been looking back at my life and trying to decide at what point was I the happiest, and I wonder: what was the best/happiest period of your life? not a singular moment like getting married but more like a significant amount of time in your life where you were the most content.

High school I was a loner. It was uncommon for me to say less then 50 words during a school day. It was more attend class and do all my homework. I was in karate and Jiu Jitsu my latter two years. I thoroughly enjoyed that.

College at points I had friends which I never really had previously, I worked, and I studied a lot The friends were fleeting and didn't stick around. Im not sure if i just thought they were friends or they were just using me. Probably the latter. Work sucked. Studying was just me trying to get through so i could eventually study what i wanted. I also went through a lot that I don't want to get into. That surprisingly for as profound of an experience has had very little impact currently.

After I worked as a scribe predominantly at an oncology clinic while studying for the MCAT. I guess if I had a time of my life that was the best this may have been it. But I didn't have friends again, I had no money and everything I earned I either paid back debt or saved for medical school. That said I loved my job it allowed me to gain valuable experience and fell in love with the specialty. Especially towards the end the main doctor I worked under believed in me which was new for me. I never had anyone believe in me before. He ultimately committed suicide my second year in medical school.

Medical school i have written about and is honestly not just one period. That said even the happiest time the first couple months were marred by the salient parts of the story, health struggles (fractured foot), and many other things. Everything just got worse from there.

And of course the current period has been hell no way around it or at least a slow descent into it.",2644683,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had always been a shit tier student but after a big move out of a shitty situation and to a whole new place I started doing well at my second attempt at college (both times were community college but still lol) and for the first time I felt my ambitious goal of getting a PhD becoming some amazing academic or scholar was actually achievable and not just some delusional pipe dream (although obviously I could've been accused of thinking way too far ahead).

I also actually built up a formidable reading habit from scratch from literally nothing and was finally starting to actually read all the books that I had purchased that had been collecting dust for years prior.

This stuff gave me confidence, hope and even some pride. I was still a loser, I was always destined to be a loser. But at least I was a loser who had finally justified his existence and found where he excelled. And I was finally out of a shitty, stressful household. Everything was looking up for the first time ever.

And then in late December the first concussion happens, which either triggered or coincided with a slew of health problems that PERMANENTLY RUINED all of that shit from 2023. So CTB is not only an option for me all over again, it's kinda imperative at this point.

Sorry for all of that. I have a terrible habit of always being painfully long winded. I swear my dad could ask me about lunch and I could respond to him in a similar way.

my mum literally told me yesterday she judged someone for having a messy guest room and said they lived like animals. That someone was her ""friend"".

My plan (first post) (SN method help request),2626052,Savaldia,"Aug 9, 2024 at 8:06 PM","I've been thinking of ctb for a long while, and got the final push to really start on the research a couple weeks ago

My original problem with most other methods was always the failure rate and possibility of brain damage, so I tried once, then went straight to research

My original idea was something like potassium cyanide that would knock you out, and kill you shortly after, but that is almost impossible to come by where I am (Canada) (or possibly anywhere).

So, I spent a couple days trying to find another option, drinking antifreeze or other household things crossed my mind, but it seems they have uncertain chances of succeeding most of the time.

I finally stumbled onto this website, after browsing a couple articles that, unhelpfully, never mentioned the name of either the method, or website.

My method:

I'm hoping to entirely disappear. So I plan to go out camping in the middle of nowhere, and just never come back.

As for how I am think of doing it - I want to use the SN method.

I just need a couple questions answered:

First, where can I get SN from? I'm in Canada, and am not sure if it would be flagged at customs, or where to go through. Everything I've come across requires a business account.

Any help with this would be much appreciated

I used a Polish supplier and shipping was 90% of the cost to get it to the UK. Shipping to Canada would probably set you back £100 which is $175 CAD.

The stuff you get at butcher shops is likely to be around 95% sodium chloride 5% sodium nitrite. For meat preserving purposes this is more than good enough. If you ask for pure sodium nitrite this will probably raise suspicion. You could try using chemistry skills to separate the two compounds but you'll need to check to resulting purity very closely (also you would need to order a lot of NaCl-NaNO2 mix to get enough NaNO2).",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I agree with everything everyone else said above.
I don't think the butcher shops are going to be your answer, but I'm in another country so maybe I'm wrong. I would also suggest, if you've earned the search function, to search for Canadians & their experience - read old threads first & then reach out - even if they're not ready to share sources, they may have more accurate info about how much it may cost, how long it may take, your customs procedures & maybe if not a direct source, at least a country to aim for that may send to you.
Start you in the right direction for your research.

What i propose that that i cut off my man parts and bleed out. Maybe i could even write on the walls in my own blood as i bleed out on the floor.

I can't really afford pain killers, unless there are any on the market worth like `30 quid or something, so ill need something else. I was thinking of using rubber bands to cut off the flow, essentially killing anything there and maybe making everything numb enough to surgery myself. that only covers half of the issue. cutting into your own flesh is a very hard thing to do, even if theres no pain.

im thinking of some crazy methods,2645360,EvisceratedJester,"Aug 25, 2024 at 3:15 PM","Maybe let's not cut off our genitals? First off, it's unlikely that you'll even be able to get past the psychological barrier you need to in order to accomplish that in the first place. You would need to become desensitized first, which takes quite a bit of time and usually requires that you are being exposed to something first-hand over and over again. For example, when I cut myself deep enough to see my fat for the first time it scared the shit out of me, despite having been exposed to bean cuts online before. Desensitization takes a while and, in cases like this, cannot be accomplished through just looking up gorey videos and pictures. It requires that you experience it yourself repeatedly and even then there is no guarantee that you'll ever become desensitized to it.

Secondly, what does ""I think it would be fitting for someone of my... identity to die like that"" mean? I don't think that your identity should make it so that you deserve to die in a cruel and painful manner.

Thirdly, I feel like ctbing via cutting off your genitals is just painful and is probably not even going to work. The psychological and physical barriers are going to get in the way and you are probably more likely to end up in the hospital with permanent damage than instead of dying.

failed fent attempt - help me!,2645407,nottinghams,"Aug 25, 2024 at 3:54 PM","so I just want to warn: I am not trying to freak anybody out. What went wrong with my ctb is a unique situation. I wasn't even revived with Narcan.

It seemed perfect. I had seven syringes, all topped with water mixed in with my whole spread of fentanyl. 700 mg. Each syringe has 3 mL of liquid in it.

I considered the possibility that it was impure. A test strip I did revealed that it was actually fent for sure. I didn't consider how impure it could be.

I was told the lowest in most cases was 10%. So 10% pure fentanyl in 700 mg of powder equals 70 mg in strength. This is more than enough to kill a person.

I had used some of my stash previously to test and even to gain some relief. I sort of felt some relief, but it did take more than I thought to get there. It was surprising, considering fentanyl's lethality.

I thought, even if my leftover stash only equal 7 mg of fentanyl in power (if it had 1% purity that is) that would still be more than enough.

I stuck all seven syringes into my leg at once and pushed the plungers as fast as I could. I did not go immediately unconscious. It took about five minutes to even feel anything. about 10 minutes after that to feel so tired I couldn't lift my head.

If I was dying, I would've had two hours left alone. Which is plenty of time to be alone and not be revived with Narcan. But I was not even revived with narcan. after those two hours were up people found me and awakened me from sleeping. They awakened me naturally, they had no idea I tried to use fentanyl to ctb. After that I vomited several times, was terribly dreary and had difficulty walking, so they called the ambulance. I was delivered to the hospital and asked questions, even about my mental health. I lied and said I took away too much Adderall, for fun, not to kill myself. Nobody has any idea I tried to kill myself with fentanyl with those syringes.

I keep thinking back to when I had to use a little more than necessary (fentanyl) To feel barely anything, and that was just recreationally.

Since I wasn't even revived with Narcan, and just awakened normally, I wonder what went wrong with my suicide?

I'm terrified. I desperately want to use fentanyl to ctb.

did I somehow not use enough? was the purity really that bad? was it actually fentanyl? is there anything wrong with MY body?

some of the mods on this forum have tried to assure me that there is a solution to this and I can still use fentanyl to suicide, i don't have to find something different. and I am inclined to agree. The problem with my method seems fixable.

Now I invite other users to explore with me, what went wrong and perhaps help me fix it. It was very distraughting when I was woken up. I am scared and want to still be able to suicide with this method.

I think your dealer may have overestimated his maths a bit

A strong pain killing dose of fentanyl is 50mcg (MICROgrams) per kg body weight. So if you're 50kg, that's just 2.5 MILLIgrams. Most street deals are around 0.1g or 100mg. If your fent was 10%, just one dose would have been enough and would have killed most people who use it.

Retail dealers rarely cut their own stuff, so whoever you asked probably pulled a number out of his arse.

I myself tried to CTB with a heroin and benzo overdose in 2013. I just passed out and woke up a day later with some mild memory deficits.

Also most opioid overdoses are poly drug, so they also in the vast majority of cases have benzos on board (think xanax, klonopin, diazepam / Valium etc). These are often mixed with the opioid by the user for the added effect, but make it very easy to OD.

If i were you, I would take 1.5x previous dose but ALSO (very important) take some benzodiazepines half an hour prior. Think 30mg of Valium or something equivalent.

They're a puzzle piece maybe but don't start saying benzos are a suicide or OD drug because they aren't.

You do not need benzos to die from fentanyl.

Get better fentayl.

"If I feel that I can't cbt, what can I do?",2644625,indexmatica,"Aug 24, 2024 at 11:51 PM","I feel pretty bad as usual. Three weeks ago an aunt died and I cleaned her dead body. She died at my cousin's house and I was there at the time. She had cancer. It's the first time I touched a dead body, the smell, the feel of the skin, the weight of the body once the person is dead is a feeling I can't forget and I think it traumatized me a little bit. She was in the intensive recovery process of my brother after a traffic accident that could have killed him and that is why I was fond of her. I don't like to remember her like this, but I don't know what I should do.
I have been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time. I have taken antidepressant medication to overdose, but it was not successful. I had to deal with the consequences. I have been looking for painless methods, but it is also very difficult for me to commit suicide. All that trauma and pain that I can cause to those around me, whether they hurt me or not, is something that stops me. I don't feel happy. I am a student at a prestigious university in my country, I am doing very well academically, I even have a job with multiple professors. I have a scholarship from the state and I have won two important awards from the university. But I don't feel happy, none of this makes me feel better, in fact, it makes me feel more depressed, stressed out and anxious. Sometimes I think that the people around me are not interested in me, think badly of me or envy me.
I told a friend that I won again the award for the best in my career. The next day, I saw her with puffy eyes, as if she had cried. That made me feel bad and it makes me rethink our friendship.
But I'm a coward. I haven't kill myself after all. I live in a lot of pain, the world is a horrible place. I wish I had the courage like some people to commit suicide and finally be free.
Also, I feel like I am a bad person. For example, there are times when I don't want to eat because my sister asks me to make food, but I get busy because I am working or studying and sometimes I don't do it and she gets mad at me. So I prefer not to eat because I feel guilty, as if I don't deserve the food she makes, even though she always leaves me food. It makes me feel very bad and I just wish my heart would stop beating and I could leave this world. In fact, I wish I had never been born.

Handling a dead body is an experience in itself... And it can feel scary and terribly painful..

You might want to try everytime you notice you're thinking about it switch to a (somewhat forced in the beginning maybe) happier memory of your aunt.

I understand entirely that you probably love this person or are in love with them. It makes it harder to leave; it makes it harder to give up on a possibility that they would stop saying and doing the things that hurt you. It's hard to let go of someone like this if you deeply care about their well-being and just want to be there for them when things are hard and when things are really good, I'm still struggling really bad to let go. I don't know all the variables of your relationship with this person, so I'm just going to go off of what I know from this thread, so I'm sorry if I assume wrong or the things I say really don't help. His behavior is that of someone who doesn't care about how you're doing or if you're doing well. If that was the case, him making fun of you and saying ""kys"" a lot would stop and he would make it a priority to make sure you got better and that things between you two were improving and getting healthier. Everyone that has said he isn't a good person to keep around is right, he isn't. This relationship is toxic as you're aware you feel deeply enough that you can't live without him because you've been deprived of the love and attention that every person needs. Listen, don't listen to the criticism you're getting about you being in an abusive relationship like this one. Don't even pay attention to people arguing in your comments I saw one person say that he was stressed out too and that may be the reason why he said that, but literally no one with any basic human decency would tell someone to do that just because they're are stressed or upset/frustrated ( not criticizing the person who said it, just helping the poster out :) ). If you feel like your situation is, it's not your fault you're in an abusive relationship and it's not your fault he is treating you terribly. At all. It's not. I started cutting when I was with him earlier this year, and it barely did anything for me, but I can see how it may be one of the last few things to help you feel better somehow. Nevertheless, it ultimately leads to nothing. Please, don't continue to cut and try finding other ways of getting things out. I heard using a rubber or hairband on your wrist helps to replace cutting and you could try that.

I'm trying my best not to overwhelm you with a giant paragraph but if you need to talk about what you're going through or you literally just need someone to talk to at all, or need any help in taking steps to leaving him, just let me know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I feel like im at the end of the road. All signs point to CTB. I've tried my hardest to do everything right but I feel like a huge fuck up. the last 3 years has been very difficult for me. I haven't been able to find a job and I literally have no money left. my rent is due in 3 days and have no way to pay for it. I feel like I would be doing my family a favor if I was just gone. I want to send my wife back to her family so I can get the opportunity to end it all.

I am self diagnosed with depression because where I live its too taboo to go to a psychologist for help. I was molested by a close family member at the age of 5 and this lasted for weeks before he moved away. Growing up I became a sex addict and a minor drug addict.. I was able to stop doing drugs but my sex addiction haunts me daily.

I got married to a really great women who treats me well. I have an amazing child that I really love but my depression always gets the best of me. I fight these urges everyday and feel like if I'm gone they will be sad but it's also better to not drag them down with me.

I come from a strict family and semi close to them. I haven't been able to talk to anyone about my severe depression and suicidal thoughts.

Everyday is struggle and it's getting harder and harder to keep a fake smile and pretending everything is OK when it's not. I really feel bad for my family and wish I never existed. I feel like im dragging everyone down with me without their knowledge and consent.

Maybe CTB is the best option for me. Maybe it isn't. I'm still contemplating what to do but as much as I try to look at the brighter side it only seems more dull and black. I dont want to drag my family with me. I want peace and want to give my family peace as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

.. SODIUM NITRITE DEATH PROTOCOLS ..
………………………………………………………….

Dear SS members, I would like to share with you what I have learnt on the Sanctioned Suicide (SS) platform on Sodium Nitrite (SN), what to expect during an SN death and my own plan to Catch The Bus (CTB) with SN. I welcome your comments, feedback and ideas.

Here are the 3 parts I cover in this thread:
1. SN Death Protocols;
2. Description of SN Death;
3. How to Successfully CTB with SN.

….…………………………………………………...…
…..….….. 1. SN Death Protocols ……....…...
…………………………………………………….……

Below are my own CTB protocols for SN. I came up with 2 options. The difference between the 2 options is the availability of drugs. Option #1 is close to what's highlighted in the Peacefull Pill Handbook [cf. 1st document attached]. My preference goes to Option #2 which is a mix of my own knowledge and of Stan's recommendations - but I don't have access to Ondansetron. In Option #2, I tried to come up with an SN protocol that Maximizes Peacefulness to be as close as possible to MAiD (Medical Aid in Dying) standards (such as DDMP, DDMA and DDMAPh). Note that both Option #1 and Option #2 minimize the maximum time to death with the adjunction of Propranolol which enhances the lethality of SN. The expected Average Time to Death is 40 minutes. The expected Maximum Time to Death is 3 hours for Option #1 and 1.5 hours for Option #2. The probability of vomiting is close to zero with Option #2 because of a Symbiotic Antiemetics (AEs) Regimen of Metoclopramide and Ondansetron. Note that if you weight over 100kg (220 pounds), you should increase the SN drink from 25gm to 35gm.

OPTION #1
……………..
Day 1
• 20:00
- 1 X 10mg Metoclopramide
Day 2
• 4:00
- 1 X 10mg Metoclopramide
• 12:00
-1 X 10mg Metoclopramide
• 20:00
- 1 X 10mg Metoclopramide
Day 3
• No food on Day 3, only water
• 4:00
- 1 X 10mg Metoclopramide
• 11:00
- Stop drinking water
• 12:00
- 1 X 1000mg of Paracetamol
• 12:20
- 3 X 10mg Metoclopramide
- Antiacid (with Magnesium Hydroxide)
e.g. 800mg Tagamet (H2 antagonist cimetidine)
• Wait 40 minutes
- During the wait time, dissolve 25gm of Sodium Nitrite in 50-100ml of plain water
- Prepare a second 25gm SN drink (in case vomiting happens)
- Pulverize 20x30mg tablets of Oxazepam (Benzos)
- Pulverize 0.8gm of Propranolol tablets
- Mix Oxazepam tablets with enough water until a drinkable solution is created
- Mix Propranolol in SN drink
• 13:00
- Drink SN + Propranolol in water
- Drink Oxazepam in water
• Lay back

OPTION #2
……………..
Day 1
• 00:00
- 1 X 8mg Ondansetron
Day 2
• 12:00
- 1 X 8mg Ondansetron
• 00:00
- 1 X 8mg Ondansetron
Day 3
• No food on Day 3, only water
• 11:00
- Stop drinking water
- 1 X 8mg Ondansetron
• 12:00
- 1 X 1000mg of Paracetamol
• 12:20
- 3 X 10mg Metoclopramide
- Antiacid (with Magnesium Hydroxide)
e.g. 800mg Tagamet (H2 antagonist cimetidine)
• Wait 40 minutes
- During the wait time, dissolve 25gm of Sodium Nitrite in 50-100ml of plain water
- Prepare a 2nd 25gm SN drink (in case vomiting happens)
- Pulverize 0.5gm Diazepam + 7.5gm Morphine SR* + 1gm Propranolol (Mixture)
- Mix pulverized tablets with enough water until a drinkable solution is created
• 13:00
- Drink SN in water
- Drink Mixture in water
- Lay back

* Note: With Morphine SR, all you have to do is to open the capsules and to pulverize the micro-beads to make them fast release. ""Crushing, chewing, or dissolving slow-release oral morphine capsules can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine sulfate."" source: https://cpsa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slow-release-Oral-Morphine-Updated.pdf
Note also that you can replace Morphine with Fentanyl (as suggested in the PPH book) or Protonitazene.

=> SN Average Time to Death: 40 min
=> SN Maximum Time to Death: 2 hours

………………………………………………….………
…..…… 2. Description of SN Death ………..
………………………………………………….………

There are hypothetical descriptions of SN death experiences on the SS platform. Recently, I read of a hypothetical person who didn't take any antiemetics (AEs) nor benzodiazepines (benzos) nor Propranolol.

That account didn't sound great. Dizzy, nauseous, vomiting, fast heart beat, not knowing how they were feeling when the breath sounds were audible. Once again, she didn't take AEs, nor benzos, nor Propranolol.

I just want to fall into a peaceful sleep and know nothing about it.

…………………………………………………….……
…. 3. How to successfully CTB with SN ….
………………………………………………….………

SUMMARY:
- The most important thing is to drink SN on an empty stomach and to not be rescued.
- It's good to take antiemetics (AEs) because it decreases the risk of vomiting. Note that metoclopramide is not the best AE (because it's a neuroleptic, it's going to make you feel down because it blocks dopamine). Best AEs are prokinetic AEs such as Ondansetron.
- An antacid with magnesium hydroxide is recommended because more SN is absorbed at a faster rate at the beginning of the process (note that vomiting is ok as long as enough SN has already been absorbed and that a second SN glass is available to drink). Indeed, a pre-dose of H2 antagonist cimetidine can increase absorption of SN (e.g. 800mg Tagamet taken 40 minutes before SN drink). [cf. 2nd document attached].
- Propranolol allows you to die faster and have fewer side effects. Stan recommends 800mg. Indeed, the concurrent use of a beta-blocker such as Propranolol enhances the lethality of SN. [cf. 2nd document attached].
- Take 0.6gm of Oxazepam (or 0.5gm of Diazepam) in water right after the SN drink. Benzodiazepines remove anxiety and this large amount will knock you down.

sources: Stan's recommendations on SS, PPH book and members posts.

Below is a compilation of relevant quotes:
…………………………………………………………………

« My understanding has always been that if one fasts 4-8 hours prior, uses 25g SN mixed with 50-100ml water, and is not interrupted, then one can expect death in 1-4 hours. I've repeatedly given this advice; if I am in error, I want to know so that I can correct it going forward, and also stop arguing with different advice. »

« The essential component is the SN. Everything else is meant to make the process easier for you and to minimise any possible symptoms and discomfort. […] The second most important step of the method after making the SN drink and swallowing it, is for the SN to stay in your stomach. You are drinking a toxic liquid and your body defences will recognise this and may try to cleanse your body. One of the defence systems is vomiting. (This is followed by a list of antiemetics that will perform as needed, as antinausea medication and some antiemetics will be ineffective.) »

« We know from anecdotal accounts prior to Stan's Guide being posted, as well as after, that antiemetics are not a guarantee that vomiting will not occur, and that vomiting is not a guarantee of method failure. »

« First, the antiemetic is ""suggested"" here, not insisted upon. Techically, I don't see that it is insisted upon in Stan's Guide either but, as I mentioned above, it's confusing. Second, while Stan's Guide said that keeping SN in the stomach is important, the PPH says what is of importance is rapid gut absorption. For this, the PPH recommends fasting and Tagamet, an H2 antagonist (Stan's Guide offers more options). However, neither fasting nor the antagonist is demanded as part of the regimen, while Stan's Guide says that fasting is an essential part of the regimen (not quoted, see link). »

« Keeping the SN in your stomach is the second milestone. To achieve this, you need to take an antiemetic. He's stating that the antiemetic helps you to achieve the second goal, prevention of vomiting. »

« Stan said ""The regime is there to help you to have a higher success rate by not throwing up and lowering stomach acid, it's the SN that kills you.""»

« Stan: Will it hurt?
""There could be some discomfort during the process, it's not a tickling contest. When it comes to physical pain, headaches (low level ones and not splitting migraines), a bit of a stomach ache perhaps. Fast heart rate which is not painful but I can appreciate it could increase anxiety. Laboured breathing as the body works to try and get more oxygen in, again not painful but could increase anxiety. But you may get no symptoms at all. If you have an underlying physical health condition, then nobody knows how you will react. people can't ask other people for a personal prognosis on how they react to SN. I absolutely understand people want to know. Just need to understand what could happen to you as the worse case scenario and then hope for the best. Again, the worse case scenario with SN is far less then many other methods that are as easy as this to do."" »

« Particular types of antacid are a good idea, and may be more helpful than Metoclopramide (Meto) in that they assist the method in working, while Meto tries to stop something from happening but may or may not, depending on the person. »

Stan said: « The purpose of antacid has nothing to do with quicker absorption of SN. In your stomach there is something called gastric juices, one of the components of this juice is hydrochloric acid (HCL). When SN mixes with HCL, it converts to regular salt. There isn't enough HCL in your stomach to convert all of a 15/20/25gm dose, but it will reduce it. Therefore less SN gets passed to the small intestine where the process of actually transferring it into bloodstream starts. The stomach only prepares the food for digestion, it does not absorb it into the bloodstream. So the purpose of antacid is to help reduce that conversion so more SN moves into the small intestine. Can you be successful without antacid - yes. But seeing that it is the most simplest of the medications to get OTC I don't see why you should not. If you can only get a simple solution from your pharmacy, then something is better than nothing. »

« What you need is an Antacid with Magnesium Hydroxide in it. Why do you recommend that one over others? Well there are a number of other alkali that neutralise stomach acid, but this is the most benign on the list and has minimal to no conflict with other medications. It is generally known as Milk of Magnesia. »

Stan said: « Nausea for me regarding SN is such a voodoo subject because there are obvious causes for it such as taste and stomach saying ""no thanks"". But then that does not tally up with medical reports on people passing through accidental exposure. I personally believe the power of the mind is understated when we talk about this. I wish I had a hard, solid scientific answer as I know it is the biggest concern for people, but I don't. people who have taken Meto report vomiting so it is not a guarantee. »

« Now the popular narrative on the forum is that meto is a must, and vomiting is a common cause of method failure (which I said in a comment on this thread I may research anecdotes to either prove it or debunk it). »

« The vast majority of successes did not report redosing. Until recently, the folks who vomited still succeeded as long as they didn't receive medical intervention and as long as they took over 17g with 100ml or less of water. »

« What's been reported in the past is that if someone held the SN down for several minutes, then enough was in their system to succeed unless they were interrupted or sought help. That's been the common narrative for as long as I've been a member, until just recently. »

« No, neither are essential to SN working. An acid reducing agent, even a simple antacid is so ubiquitous, I can't imagine why one wouldn't use them. By far, the most important factor would be to reduce the time in the stomach, as SN is acid liable, and this means fasting and an empty stomach. Various studies have been conducted on transit speed out of the stomach and into the duodenum (where SN is absorbed). The simplest numbers I can give are that for a studied volume, 50% of the liquid is out of the stomach in 10 minutes. Numbers vary slightly depending on volume or osmolality and in studies with radiopaque isotopes, but it's a fair estimate as with an N overdose, individuals will die with N or SN in their stomach, unabsorbed. Said another way, parenteral dosing of either could be much lower than oral dosing. The reason such large doses are given is to ensure speed. Should the dose of SN be reduced? Definitely not, but this is why even with vomiting, people succeed. I'm almost loathe to talk about antiemtics but will highlight a few points. If prokinetic antiemetics are available, then use them. Likewise if Ondansetron is available as well, use it. If only Zofran is available, then use it. Vomiting has both a central and peripheral mechanism, and the seratinergic and dopaminergic antiemetics function at different receptors. The heavy preference for Meto vs Zofran is, in large part, regional|national. I've posted several times on why the advice to test Meto is horrible and should be stopped and won't repeat it here it seems the majority (vast majority?) will vomit with or without antiemetics. Redosing can overcome this. Likewise, I say this is why antiemetics are categorically not ""essential."" Stand guide is generally excellent and was put together to help others. I suspect in part it emparts a sense of control on behalf of those who follow it. Is everything in it essential? Of course not. Some of the items, such as a recommendation to take Ibuprofen or Tylenol likely will have ZERO impact on discomfort or headache. However, if people feel they help, then it is a positive and a benefit to take. Bottom line, the essentials for SN are fasting, SN, and possibly redosing in cases where vomiting occurs very quickly. »

« Stan's point was that if you have the correct amount of poison, an empty stomach and some backup shots in case of vomiting, you will die. However, the correct AE is a great helper to not vomit in the first place. Anything else is for your comfort. »

« I went through all the failed attempts reported on the forum, and there have been none that cited vomiting as the cause of failure. Only one may have been caused by vomiting, but there were other factors that could have been the cause, or a combination of factors. Of 23 cases, the overwhelming cause of failure (16 cases) was getting help or being interrupted. »

SN DEATH PROTOCOLS,2555282,007Bob,"Jun 10, 2024 at 5:12 AM","Antiacid debate you need it or not:
In 2019, when Stan wrote his guide he used Ppeh as a reference and that year ppeh book recommended to use antiacid.

Basically raising the pH of the stomach (lowering the acidity) decreases the SN converting into Nitric oxide which is a vasodilator that will drop your blood pressure drastically resulting in unconsciousness. This is the main and fastest mechanism that SN knocks you out and antacids can slow this process resulting in you staying conscious longer. Most people think SN knocks you out by lowering oxygen levels in your tissues and yes that would eventually lead to unconsciousness, but the vasodilator effect is much quicker and is why people who take SN can collapse at any time without warning so it's best to be laying down or sitting after you take it.

Recently everything have changed, ppeh book says ""The advantage of lowering stomach acid in order to lessen gastric no production (with the associated drop in blood pressure) vis a which allowing more nitrite to be directly absorbed into blood from the small intestine.""

Therefore, the benefit (in terms of potentiation) of taking an antiacid and proton pump inhibitor (PPI), cannot be established, this is no longer advised.


Conversation in 2022: « ""Hello Dr Nitschke,
Why are anticids no longer recommended for sodium nitrite? Is it because people lose consciousness faster without anticids?"" Dr Nitschke: ""Raising gastric pH might increase the NO2- that moves into the small intestine speeding death, but it decreases the NO production in the stomach and blood pressure drop. No longer a recommendation.""»",2555090,,,,,,,,,,,,
SN DEATH PROTOCOLS,2555423,Nettles,"Jun 10, 2024 at 8:16 AM","The latest edition of PPEH mention that the Propranolol isn't a ""luxury"" item but enhances the effect of SN by restricting cardiac output while the brain is trying to compensate the loss of oxygen therefore Propranolol taken with the anti emetics before the SN is effective according to the regime in the PPEH 2024. Though the new dosage is decreased to 400 mg. You can also ""potentiate"" SN by dissolving the Propranolol, but then 2 g, with the SN.

And yes, antacid though debated is no longer recommended.

However Propranolol or beta blockers are mentioned in the regime only ""if available"" and same regards to benzo after consuming the SN. It's the SN that's important.
The following has been observed by firsthand eyewitness after consuming 25 g of SN ""potentiated"" with 2 g of Propranolol;
@3 mins dizzy
@5 mins very drowsy, responsive
@12 mins unconscious
@15 mins deep sleep/ un-rousable
@25 mins increasing cyanosis

SN DEATH PROTOCOLS,2555530,007Bob,"Jun 10, 2024 at 10:12 AM","I just found a source to have access to Ondansetron. So basically now I have access to 2 SN options to CTB. Can you help me with the pros and cons of each method? I want to make sure that I chose the right SN Protocol to have a Peaceful Death. Can you please share your suggestions and feedback?

Here are the meds used in each option:

……………….
OPTION #1
……………...
AEs: Metoclopramide
1st Drink: 25gm SN + 0.8gm Propranolol
2nd Drink: 0.6gm Oxazepam

OPTION #2
……………....
AEs: Metoclopramide, Ondansetron
1st Drink: 25gm SN
2nd Drink: 0.5gm Diazepam + 7.5gm Morphine SR + 1gm Propranolol

Option #1 is close to what's highlighted in the Peacefull Pill Handbook. It's tried and verified method.

In Option #2, I tried to come up with an SN protocol that Maximizes Peacefulness to be as close as possible to MAiD (Medical Aid in Dying) standards (such as DDMP, DDMA and DDMAPh) - but it comes from my creative mind. Option #2 also has 7.5gm Morphine SR: is it necessary? What would be the impact of including 7.5gm of Morphine SR? What do you think of the change of AEs to include Ondansetron? What are your thoughts and suggestions on these 2 options? I am open to come up with a third option that would be the best of all. Thank you in advance to your help on this

* Note that the MAiD (Medical Aid in Dying) protocols such as DDMP calls for 15gm of Morphine.

Questions about the SN from BO,2597263,Dark-Knight,"Jul 15, 2024 at 12:05 PM","Did anyone get sn from a german company who sells sn from the polish source? It's basically the same sn from but sold by a different company. They have different options of quantities of sn, 500 g, 1 kg, 5 kg etc. I got one package of 1 kg, I was wondering if the difference in quantities matters, for example if one package of 500 g has a different purity than 1 kg, or are they the same sn with the same purity and the only difference is the quantity?

For both 500 g and 1 kg it's mentioned on their website the purity is at least 98% although the grade type isn't mentioned. Is the lack of mention of the grade type something to be cautious about? Vizzy's guide says the grade type isn't important, the most important thing is for the sn to have at least 95% purity. I'm not sure if the fact BO don't mention the grade type is something significant or not.

I know that people tested the sn from BM and said it's pure enough. I might do both the nitrite test with aquarium strips and blood test for it although it's not certain how accurate the results will be, I'm curious to see if there are others who tested the sn and if it's pure or not",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Questions about the SN from BO,2608433,DOHARDTHINGS24,"Jul 24, 2024 at 10:46 PM","Hey, I don't have a lot to offer as I'm a bit of a newbie but will tell you what I know in case it's useful, & if not, apologies & disregard.
I have emailed a company this week that starts with B & am not one hundred percent sure we're taking about the same - their logo has 4 parts & maybe they sell BM with a blue lid???
If this lines up, I emailed them (B with the 4 part logo) this week with a bunch of dumb questions about shipping etc & they immediately sent me an adobe pdf which I assume is full of the technical specs or a CoA or something - I have no digital privacy & was too afraid to open it. But they sent it immediately & that might put your mind at rest. And I don't know the differences in types of reagent & grades etc but from every single thing I've seen, it looks like the percentage is the important part. And I had planned to do both a blood test & aquarium test yesterday but only got the blood done before I was nearly busted - I'm not a child at home, I'm nearly 50 in an abusive relationship. I didn't want to cut myself as I was worried either I couldn't do it or the opposite, that I'd become a cutter - no judgment, just now is not the time to pick up new things…. Someone on here mentioned a diabetic lancing kit which I got & am thrilled with that choice. I got out 2 tiny white dishes. Put a little bit of SN in one - I think the rec is 0.1g but my scales don't go that low. And put a little bit of SN on a tiny piece of baking paper. I put a drop of blood into the dish with SN. And a drop of blood into the empty dish & poured in the SN off the paper. Both turned dark chocolate brown immediately. I hope at least some of this is useful… And may I ask a question of you regarding packaging please? - if we are talking about the same B with the four part logo, I also asked about the discretion of packaging (my hopefully legit DMC tell fibs on their packaging). I am in Australia & hope it wouldn't be an issue with customs & I'm not terrified of the government doing welfare checks like the poor UK people - but the B I spoke to said they only send to personal addresses, not to PO Boxes (which I don't have yet but was considering). When I asked about the discretion of packaging, they said they always put the logo on the packaging. And if it's the blue lid bottles, they look an awkward shape. My issue is my ex that I am stuck living with at the moment - I literally ran to the letterbox & got there seconds ahead of him & stuffed my SN up my shirt because it was flat packaging - if he gets to it first, he will use it against me - call crisis, tell lies to have me committed, blackmail me, anything - he literally went through my rubbish bin in front of me last night - so if we're talking about the same B & BM, can you please respond, either here or privately, & tell me if the outside packaging indicates what's inside & if the size or shape of it is distinctive or what I could say it was or anything like that??? I haven't fully decided whether to order from them - I don't have any other backup sources & it's freaking me out. I've long since missed my CTB date & may not have the time to order from a second source - but life has been throwing some extreme curveballs that have kept me here & if I find out I'll be stuck here longer, I will one hundred percent order from B & any other source that people wanna throw at me - prefs not the Indian ones because I know there's a tonne of stock shortages. Anything legit like a good lab. Anywhere that is happy to be discreet with packaging. Sorry for hijacking your post, I started trying to be helpful to you & then it took an ADHD turn & here we are…. so sorry
I was writing at the same time as @StevFabi was posting - my letters start & end the same with the same amount of letters. So I'm pretty confident we're talking about the same thing, & hoping it's the same as OP.
If anyone at all has answers about packaging, either now as in already received, or in the future if yet to receive, I'd be super grateful if that was passed on, either on this thread or in private. My questions are at the bottom of my response to OP. I posted my original answer, then saw @StevFabi response & tried to write a second & it sent as one so if this one merges as well, I'm very sorry.

i’m so lonely,2643320,imalreadyd3ad,"Aug 23, 2024 at 5:13 PM","hi all, i'm ""new"" to this site and i mean i was here on 2019/2020 and then i had to fight for so many things but i never forgot the love and care i received here.
since then, things got worse, my dad passed away two years ago and since he left i can't find reasons to live and depression is getting worse. i promised him i'll finish university but i'm not even doing exams anymore,
I keep putting off exams, feeling anxious because they'll soon realize that I'm no longer able to study.
I'm not as well off as other people who attend my university, I see them doing their exams on time and even in a few days, I see them celebrating in all things. I, on the other hand, no longer find meaning, I live with the fear of death, but at the same time I would like to stop living. very often I don't even remember the names of things or people and I believe that all this came following the last depressive episode in which I spent 8 months in bed sleeping, I didn't wash myself and I never wanted to eat, I just went by of chocolate.
my ex occasionally gets in touch with me and pretends to be my friend, in reality she always finds a perfect excuse to tell me how beautiful her life is since her boyfriend is with her.
while I don't even have two friends in my life, i struggle in doing friendships and in university they laugh at me every time. also, if you have a friend in university studying will be also easier. my love life has been always bad and no girl has ever loved me, including her.
they only used me.
I spend most of my time alone at home and if it weren't for that video game that still keeps me alive (Fortnite) I would feel completely useless.
I have no friends, I can't make friends anymore and the people in my city have turned out to be opportunists. one day they say hi to you and the other day they pretend that they don't even see you.
How much I would like to just have a trusted friend, but I know I will always be alone.
I'm not afraid of death, if I'm the one who has to die, I really wish there was a faster method than SN and i wish i'm able to ctb in september before going back to university",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have a neurological condition that's heating away and my arms legs and face and it's basically destroyed my career opportunities. I can barely go outside because of the strain the outside world puts on my body. Lost lost usage of my right arm for about a year had to go to physical therapy to regain usage of it. My life's been reduced to staying at home in my apartment in front of my computer most of the day Or just sleeping insane amounts.

Sorry to hear about the passing of your father I should say two years is a relatively short amount of time and apparently you can't always recover very fast with those types of things. I had a cousin that I knew since he was about 4 years old He was like a surrogate little brother unfortunately we drifted away the past couple years and he took his own life by jumping in front of a train 8 months ago.

It's devastated and affected me more than anything else that I've experienced up till now.

Is your profile picture of your fortnite character? It kinda reminds me of a final fantasy 14 character when I initially saw it. I can only ever use a fight stick Or track ball mouse to play games at the moment So it has somewhat limited me. However there's still many many games I can play with these limitations and I'm a pretty big fan of retro video games and movies.

Sad dreams,2646267,excinephile,"Aug 26, 2024 at 11:51 AM","I had this dream some months ago where I met this girl who looked like jean seeberg (who looked a bit like my ex whom I lost to my illness) and we went to a party on a rooftop bar and started dancing. but then she disappeared shortly after and I found out that she accidentally fell down the roof and was laying dead and broken some 10 storeys below. This encapsulates my underlying emotions towarsd my failed life so much. the party (life and love) was just getting started and was imediately cut short shortly after the first bars of the first song even though I'm more likely to be the one to be found broken and shattered literally or figuratevly speaking.

Today I had a terrible nightmare and all I remember about it was that it involved maggots, incest and being stuck in a hellish timeloop.

So sad how my life turned out to be like that and how my sleeping mind cannot but produce such heinous images. I didn't deserve it to be like that, she didn't deserve it, we all didn't deserve to end up like this yet here we are and only a fraction of us seems to have the hope of coming out on the other side of this.

Getting high before ctb,2646231,xandermax,"Aug 26, 2024 at 11:16 AM","Curious about this. I'm thinking a bit about Kurt Cobain's toxicology report, and he had a lot of heroin on board.

Yet every time I take heroin, I kinda don't feel like ctb anymore. It's quite an effective antidepressant for me. It's only after the gear wears off and the general shittiness of my life, and my bipolar, my meds and their side effects. It all feels overwhelming again.

Yet if I go, I'd like to go down high.

It's a bit of a catch 22 for me.

1. Should I fast or do anything days before?
2. When should I take metoclopramide and how much of it?
3. I'm 181cm, 50kg, male, if I take around 35g, will it be too much and could be painful for some reason?
4. Is there any reason why being outside would be bad, should I simply do it in my bed? It might be cold outside since I'm planning to ctb in January.

Any ideas of how to escape potential spiritual fallout from CTB?,2643770,excinephile,"Aug 24, 2024 at 5:46 AM","If you're a firm believer in any kind of blissfull afterlife or eternal void/nothingness I'm happy for you and you can stop reading here.

This is for those more on the fence when it comes to these issues. I'm not convinced at all that consciousness stops alltogether after death and I intuit some kind of continuity between our mental states in life and in the hereafter. That said I'm not convinced by any of the common religious or spiritual conceptions of this whole buisness. My best guess is that some version of analytic idealism could be true - meaning that we are dissociated alters of a single unified consciousness and rejoin it after death. But I still feel that the way how we exit life may have some kind of bearing on the way how we continue existing. Many of us have been driven to the brink of suicide by tragic life events or unfortunate conditions. That makes it somewhat difficult if not outright impossible for us to leave in a spiritually balanced way. I ruminate about this a lot and ask myself if there might be still any possibility for us to mitigate the potentially bad spiritual fallout resultikg from the act of self annihilation. Maybe there are some rituals or affirmations we could bear in our heart while leaving without pledging alliance to any specific dogma or doctrine?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Any ideas of how to escape potential spiritual fallout from CTB?,2643947,CantDoIt,"Aug 24, 2024 at 10:33 AM","Good question. I dont believe exactly what you do but there are aspects of my belief which overlap with yours.
For example, i believe that we are all souls broken up from the universal consciousness in order to experience life here. However, I don't really believe distress can carry on for any significant length of time after we die. Instead, I believe we are wiped clean of negative earth emotions after going through a life review or something similar. I am basing this on NDEs.

However, it is said that people can create a negative reality for themselves for some amount of time while in the in between phase. In this case, you can call for help and will be rescued.

In addition, going with your view. You are eternal and you are great, because you are a piece of the collective. The universe is all powerful and all knowing and you are the universe observing itself. You are only limited by the human body and understanding of consciousness.
Because of this, will the type of continuation that you need.

The danger in negative manifestation after death is that you are all powerful and you can create negative experiences. Knowing this, as an alter of the collective, remind yourself that you cannot be trapped by negative individuality after you have already rejoined.

Maybe you can will this before death and while dying. You can repeat it as sort of a mantra or something.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Any ideas of how to escape potential spiritual fallout from CTB?,2644086,Forever Sleep,"Aug 24, 2024 at 1:34 PM","Maybe that's true but then presumably, to end up where we are now- perhaps we've already taken our lives in previous existences. All I can think of to break the cycle- if we truly are damned for committing suicide- is to not do it! Will that be enough to redeem us though? Do you care that much about the next incarnation of you? Do you think they'll be similar to your current 'you' at all?

Let's say you did commit suicide in a previous life. How would you feel about that previous incarnation? Would you think they were weak and pathetic? Would you curse them for setting you upon this cycle of self destruction? Or, would you feel compassion for them? Why did they do it? Why were they given more than they could handle?

Let's go right back to the first incarnation that took their own life. What were they being punished for? If a difficult life is the punishment for a bad past life or, screwing up in this one, just what could they have done that was so bad to warrant that? And, why are you now being punished for all that?!! Just seems weird and terribly unfair to me. Especially considering, most of us don't even remember how we screwed up in previous lives. How does that help us to better ourselves? Maybe it is what happens but if so, it's a truly weird set up.

I'm similar to you in that I'm on the fence about all this stuff. I wish I did have firm beliefs or- non beliefs actually. I wish I was a confident atheist. I worry about any kind of religion or spiritualism being true because- look at the state of this world! I don't fancy another try anywhere else.

I guess I try to combat all of this with logic. Although, it doesn't entirely help. Religions or rules don't actually have to be logical or fair. But still, I can't help but wonder what the point of it all is. What's the point of putting people through a series of mortal lives? To test them? To teach them? To prepare them? For what? What could we be aiming for? Why punish people? Again, what the hell are we supposed to be learning from all this? It just doesn't make any sense. But then, I suppose the religious folk will just say we're too imperfect and inferior to understand and it's not for us to question God or whoever's will.

Does fear of an afterlife scare you more than the process of death itself? For me, the possible fear and pain surrounding death still frightens me more but it's just something else to worry about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Any ideas of how to escape potential spiritual fallout from CTB?,2644978,excinephile,"Aug 25, 2024 at 9:22 AM","Thank you, sounds plausible.
You sum up pretty well why I'm not comfortable with any religion or spiritual doctrine. None of them plausibly explain why the fuck we have to go through this earthly nonsense, especially if it's marked by unimaginable, meaningless suffering that just can't be chalked up to ""learning"", except if we assume that ""learning"" also implies having to go through unimaginable meaningless suffering... but then again, to what end, to be gods somewhere else.

As it stands the most plausible picture - biased by my unimaginable suffering - is that we experience good things to have them ripped away from us.

Our best bet probably is on some kind of grander scheme of things human beings just cannot comprehend and that may end up not totally detrimental to our poor souls.

Spiritual consequences of CTB and fear-induced toxic belief as block to act out the will.,2622631,Draconis,"Aug 7, 2024 at 12:58 AM","Yes made me think of the Christian belief that you go to hell if you CTB.

When you google it some ""guru"" said that:at death, the astral and causal bodies are untouched by the death of the physical body. Since our ego and personality are part of the astral body, this means that the physical body drops away, but the mental and emotional pain and suffering remain just as they were before suicide. In fact, without the weight of a physical body to tone them down, so to speak, the suffering is even more intense.

It's supremely ironic. The person seeking relief from his emotional pain finds that it doesn't diminish – rather it increases!Sometimes the person who commits suicide is actually mentally imbalanced. In such a case, the karmic suffering would not be as great, Swami Kriyananda once said.

I am sure this toxic belief grasp fear in some and get them stuck in suffering that only get worse.Swami Kriyananda has very bad karma of fear and suffering in this world..only devils make others stuck in hell...

Perhaps it was meant to teach others some kind of lesson via the ripple effects of the event.

Aside from the God stuff, the other thing I'll say is I've heard little snippets of NDEs that reference someone who CTB. There isn't much to reference, there's too many hours of these experiences to re-find these exact examples, but of those I've heard those who CTB seem to do fine. No judgement. In terms of karma, it seems like the belief of the person and whatever guilt they feel is what holds them back, but it's never imposed by an outside force, just from themselves and their dualistic thinking. I'm not saying this as fact, just from what I've gathered from NDEs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The sense I got was that life-force, or Prana, truly cannot be destroyed and the existence of the entire human race and sustaining Nature itself is what's important. We don't cry when a single flower is picked, we do what we can to nurture the entire field. It made me let go of regarding almost anything as a consequential negative event. No bad thing really mattered in the context of how beautiful pure life-force itself is. This led to me temporarily letting go of a lot of attachments that were keeping me alive. I started having regular transcendental and spiritual experiences. Stuff that just cannot be fully explained in the context it happened to me. It seemed like something on the other side was reaching out to me because it knew I would be better off dead and trying to ease my transition.

It doesn't make logical sense to me that raw natural forces would care so much about the minutia of human taboos as to punish us or sort us based on them. We're all going to the same place and it will be the same for all of us, whether you're a human or other animal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Where I go, you cannot come."" This made the Jews ask, ""Will he kill himself? Is that why he says, 'Where I go, you cannot come'?""» (John 8:21-22). At a certain point Jesus (God) is so fed up with the whole thing, that he only wants to hasten the end: «So Jesus told him [Judas], ""What you are about to do, do quickly.""» (John 13:27). And then, addressing God (and therefore himself), ""Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."" (Luke 22:42).

why me,2641480,strawberryJam,"Aug 22, 2024 at 1:51 AM","Dumb rant

I don't understand how good things come to people so easily. It seems like my life has just been getting worse and worse, I don't want to be here anymore. I've been twitching for the last half hour from suffocating myself to make sure I can properly ctb, but honestly knowing my luck I'll probably screw it up and go painfully. I don't care anymore. I don't know why god made me live so much of my life knowing that things were never going to get better.

I graduated early from college and I thought that my life was finally going to get better, I thought I'd finally impress people and nobody would think I was a stupid mess anymore, and it literally meant nothing. I've been job searching for the last year post-grad and I can't take the rejections anymore. It is humiliating watching my friends get jobs and be completely successful and knowing that they're watching me sit at home and do nothing. The other day my friend told me that her younger brother asked why I didn't have a job yet. Another told me her boyfriend was surprised I was still unemployed. I wish I could disappear. I'll never meet anybody's basic expectations because I am such a screw-up.

When I was younger I was an amazing artist. I got into prestigious art schools for music and visual arts, and my parents told me I wouldn't be able to go because it wasn't a real job. Art was the only thing I was amazing at. I was so good I was so good. I wasted so many years working in this stupid stem major that I'll never be amazing at, I miss that feeling of being so good at something that people have no option other than to take you seriously. Now I'm a pathetic nothing and I've wasted my natural talents. I'll never be as good as I was meant to be.

I don't know what I did to deserve all of this. I didn't have an easy life, I thought the universe or god owed me. I don't understand why he hates me so much. I tried praying so hard I tried memorizing prayers when nothing else worked I don't know why nothing works for me and I don't know why I have to watch everyone around me have such amazing lives knowing that I'll never do anything meaningful.

The first time I tried to ctb I swallowed a bottle of pills because my mom told me she knew I'd never get into a good college. She wasn't even being mean she just genuinely told me that she didn't think I was smart enough. I am I know I am, I probably was smart enough back then but everything is just black fog in my head now. There is nothing good in my life. I had art and I don't even have that anymore I have nothing. I could've been so amazing I don't know why god had to take that from me. I had so much I had music and art why couldn't I have that, why is my life so horrible.

There is no fixing my life anymore everything is gone. I spent so long without a job nobody will hire me anymore. I can't look anybody in the eye anymore I just want to hang in my closet and be done with everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I am seeing, in cases where SN was successful w/o a dopamine inhibitor, is that the person often took an antacid. Although the value of these has been dismissed lately, the user named slapppy on this forum posted the following, from the thread I referenced above:

""It is clear that some reported no pain at all and others experienced severe stomach pain.

Here is my explanation

Gastric acid (HCL) reacts with SN (NaNO2) to form Salt (NaCl)

According to the reaction:

NaNO2 + HCL -> HNO2 + NaCl

If you do not take an antacid to reduce the HCL in your stomach, not only will some SN be converted away before it can reach your bloodstream, you will also have a large amount of salt in your stomach, which is understandably painful

SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE AN ANTACID

IGNORING THE ANTACID CAN LEAD TO SEVERE STOMACH PAIN

You can be successful without it, but there are plenty of cases of people who ctb with an antacid to show us it is not harmful.

Even Stan took an OTC antacid. """,,,,,,,,,,,,,

With just the recommended amount of SN alone, the pph says unconsciousness happens around the 12th minute. This can stretch upto the 15th min. Problem is a lot of people have panicked and called for help in that time due to SI, and also if vomitting is there which can be expected around the 10 min mark. If SI is a big deal then benzos can help with that.

M is said to be more necessary than benzos from a vomitting point of view and helps keep the SN inside.",2484365,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think the tachycardia is what makes people panic after ingesting SN. Propranolol used to be part of the protocol and is suggested to alleviate the tachycardia and racing heart symptoms. I think the standard amount in the pph was 400 mg, but people who have ctb'ed have taken 200mg or 120 mg.. I think it was dropped as it was considered a ""luxury item"", but I think in the absence of Benzos it could be a valuable addition from an SI point of view..

With M, the Stat dose is less riskier and more effective than the 48 hour regime imo. I did some research into this a while ago.. you may possibly find this useful..

What are the negative effects from taking Meto before SN?
To follow up on this: Is it okay to take Adderall XR at the same time as the triple dose of 10 mg of Meto before SN 45minutes later?

I get this impression because I'm seeing posts by people who are saying things like ""I need/want to die"" whilst self loathing. They are self loathing when they say that they need/want to die which gives me the impression that they see death as a way to punish themselves for the benefit of the world (which is also something I don't understand the logic of but that's another topic entirely).

In my case, I also say that ""I need/want to die"" but, when I say it, I don't say it out of self loathing but actually out of love for myself. I think that death is just permanent non existence and I think that this is what I deserve because it's impossible to suffer whilst being dead and I deserve to be in a state where I don't suffer. This world doesn't deserve me and my labor. Instead, I deserve to not suffer since I never even consented into existence in the first place. I deserve to be at permanent rest.

The loss of anything you love in life is painful but the loss of people is especially painful.

Knowing that either we or our loved ones are going to go through that is awful.

We probably have come to the conclusion that our wishes aren't realistic by then but I suppose it's the final letting go of anything this world could have offered. That's maybe more difficult for people who did have hope at one stage.

With regards to people who think they deserve death as a punishment- I find that really sad too.

Getting 95% of your skin burned off and having to live with that pain is very bad. nothing is worth that much less the ridiculous addictions that they tell us are so good ,pleasurable or important.

The horrible and bad things and the suffering outweigh any garbage pleausurable subjective addictions.

The odds are something horrible will happen. There is no objective reason to risk something horrible happening. The reason i am taking such risks and suffering is because i don't have a guaranteed suicide method to escape this unfathomably evil prison.

imo it's irrational to think that this is a good situation to be in to think that ""life is good"" . There are horrible things that can happen to any human or any sentient animal anyday. The question i ask is why should i or anyone want to be happy in this dangerous situation . on top of that you have do work , do chores ,try to figure out problems , stress, regular suffering all for no purpose.

it's just a rational pros and cons analysis. the bad things outweigh the good. every human is under threat of extreme torture . there is no guarantee something horrible won't happen to anyone any day. these points and others show life is bad. Ask yourself why these things are not discussed or mentioned?
All this i wrote shows life is bad not good like the society / culture tells us.

it's these false beliefs that life is good sacred important that allow for suicidal people to be seen as insane, freaks or monsters. It's because of these beliefs that they were able to ban Nembutal , suicide booths, assisting in suicide and are about to ban SN in the U.S.A..

Sure there is. You risk something bad to try and get something good. Preferably, you take a risk where you subjectively believe:

(Value of Good thing) * Odds of good thing > (Inverse value of bad thing) * Odds of bad thing

So people who are satisfied and fulfilled must always be irrational? Under every single set of circumstances possible?

My belief is that if you are stuck existing you might as well minimize the suffering by making your situation as good as possible.

It's your personal pros and cons analysis. Other people might think differently. Doesn't make you wrong or them wrong. It took a long time but the good in my life outweighs the bad. I would like to hear an explanation for why I'm wrong.

I agree suicide methods should be legal. (I don't think anyone has an obligation to provide them, but I don't think they should be restricted by law.) I agree life is not always good. I agree that in some circumstances suicide can be logical and the right choice.

But when you declare that life is bad, it's just as easily disproven as ""life is good."" They are both absolutes. The fact is that life is sometimes good and sometimes bad.

I do really, truly pity people on here who have not felt real joy and do not understand the difference between something wonderful and a ""stupid addiction,"" but you refusing to believe it's possible is exactly like people refusing to believe mental suffering is real because they have not felt it personally.

The fascination with the word ""objective"" is getting out of hand here. I gave you a reason. Just because it's not a reason for you doesn't make it a bad, ""ridiculous"", or ""stupid"" reason.

You aren't pro-death . . . it's just that anyone who doesn't want death WON'T ACCEPT YOUR ABSOLUTE TRUTH. I'm not saying you're pro-death in that you want to force death on people. I'm saying you are pro death because you won't concede that a decent, worthwhile life is theoretically possible under any circumstances unless the person is insane and deluded. That is pro-death. Really, the only reason you don't want to force death on people is because you don't care about them. You think it is the ""objective"" best choice for everyone.

I said I think methods should be accessible, and I did not compare you to them. I'm not a member of those communities. I'm a member of this community. If it is accepted and unchallenged here that life IS an ""evil prison hell"" for everyone being ""objective"" and ""rational,"" then I can't say this place is not pro-death.

All I'm asking, right now: is it possible, in your view, for a life to be good and worthwhile to a person who is completely rational and sane?
Cool. I support your choice and freedom to evaluate your own life and circumstances.",2617722,2617722,2617722,2617722,2617722,2617722,2617722,,,,,,

It is possible for some of us to deal with extreme suffering as that's the curse of being a human.

Cutting method ( questions about it - not a method to practice yet ),2643952,Buh-bye!,"Aug 24, 2024 at 10:39 AM","Good afternoon buds,
I stumbled upon a 4chan user's reply to a suicide thread where they describe the method they might going with. wanted to know if it's actually as peaceful and simple as described below by them,
""use a very sharp knife, deep cut close to the armpite, sever the major artery in the arm. If the knife is sufficiently sharp it shouldn't be too painful and bleeding out is a relatively peaceful death.""

- which arteries might he be referring to ?
- if the knife's sharp, does it actually make the attempt less painful ? ( seems convincing )
- emphasis on the word "" severe "", does he mean to cut it off or just slit it ?

that's that.

Words of wisdom by them : ""The worst thing I can imagine is somehow surviving a gunshot to the head, and then you're not only brain damaged but then people will ""worry"" and you'll be on suicide watch in a state which was worse than before you tryied to kill yourself.""

Few points on the method/questions, I think you're mixing up sever and severe, sever means to cut, which if you lead a knife all the way to the armpit you're definitely going to hit it, (youll be able to tell an arterial bleed pretty easily as it will be pressurized and spraying out with the beat of your heart, and usually a bright colour almost neon).

The sharpness factor > so people usually use razor blades/ very sharp knives to cut due to the fine edge it makes it neater/less likely to infect, more precise yada yada, you will definitely feel a cut, even just knicking your finger with an extremely sharp blade a it'll take a moment for the body to realise as the blood flows but there will definitely be pain.

The artery he's referring to is the The axillary artery , literally any artery being nicked will kill you in minutes. It's also pretty much a death sentence without immediate medical care.
Exsanguination from an artery will be stressful, messy it won't be an easy way to go. there will be a lot of blood. The pain might not be bearable but you will get cold/go into shock and pass out probably within a minute of hitting a big enough tear/cut in any specific artery.

My 2 cents though, definitely consider another method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Everything is my fault (an incredibly long vent thread about my life).,2629815,lonely&trapped.,"Aug 13, 2024 at 1:43 AM","This is going to be a massively long post, because I want to get down every last detail about my life that is plaguing my mind. In doing so I hope I can find some resolution when I finally CTB next month.

This type of post is difficult for me to write, because its hard to pin down when exactly my life went downhill.

I feel ungrateful, because largely I had a pretty good childhood (kind of. Also, yes this post is going to be so long I'm going to categorize my thoughts into chapters here, so I hope you better like reading).


Chapter 1: My Early Life

I guess the first seeds were planted in how I was disciplined as a kid. I grew up being seen as 'overly sensitive' as a kid because the main form of discipline by my parental figures (specifically by my mom and grandmother) was to yell at me; and they did that a lot, because it was what they relied on everytime I did something wrong.

Overtime, I developed a massive fear of rejection and low-self esteem. Whenever people expressed dissaproval to me I'd often cry. My mom never really stopped yelling at me until I turned 18-19, but she still relied on emotional abuse, mental berrating and criticizing me when she could. I know she did this 'to help me', because I guess was so unselfaware and stupid I had to be told. Of course, she'd get pissed at me when I'd get sad about it because it would affect me deeply and I felt like it reflected negative stereotypes on me so to speak, because I'm autistic (yes this is my own fault, but I was very self concious about my autism and how that painted people's perception of me). I know she was just trying to help me, but considering she'd rarely ever compliment me or support me mentally, the criticism would just hurt even worse.

Like I just mentioned, I was diagnosed with being on the spectrum as a kid. When kids are really young, at that point that fact didn't really matter yet; really young kids are non-judgemental because they haven't developed that sense of cynicysm and judgement yet. My autism only became really apparent as I grew older and advanced up the grades. My friends I grew up with in catholic school (much smaller and more tight knit group of kids you are with) they started to reject me and started to ignore me. They made passing negative comments about me that made me self concious, one girl I knew would say to me ""have you learned to stop crying so much?"", and my crush that I liked at the time would say ""hes scaring me"" if my friend's egged me on to overreact to something they told me.

The yelling never stopped there either. I was bullied and yelled at by numerous teachers throughout my early life. If my friends were ignoring me, my teachers would make me feel bad. I remember this specific time I called one of my only friends a ""silly goose"". To my child brain, I didn't know the word meant a ""stupid idiot"". Obviously, my friend told on me and I got mentally berrated and yelled at really loudly by my teacher; infront of my other classmates no less. I don't know why I called him that; maybe I overheard someone else say it, I was like 9 or 10.

Moving on, in the 6th and 7th grade, my mom took me out of my old school and put me into a new one in elementary (so I can have 'better education in a better school'). I was the new kid. Because I was socially a stupid weirdo, nobody liked me. I had no friends. Most of the time I'd spend recess walking around, moping by myself and thinking about why no one liked me. Eventually, I came to the conclusion that I was too weird and socially awkward. I started to become more self aware of my autism and that I was different: I wasn't normal. It impacted my self-esteem and my self worth a lot as a kid; it still does to this day.

As young as 12 years old I started developing very early signs of depression; specifically anhedonia. I felt helpess and couldn't figure out why I felt this way; I was still basically a child, and I already felt even at that age that the optimism and wonder I always felt was slowly being drained away from my spirit. I eventually got a therapist when I was 15 until I eventually stopped seeing them (which I'll get into later).


Chapter 2: Loneliness

So, back in elementary I was obviously a lonely child; and I was a latchkey kid as well, so I was usually home alone for most of the day. This was much of the same in high school and middle school. Because of this, I did what any lonely kid does in the early 2000s; I recluded into the internet, and I'd often spend my time on yahoo answers looking for attention because nobody else would give it to me in my real life. Yes; I was pathetic and embarrassing as a child, but thats what is to be expected I guess.

This attention seeking reared its ugly head at a certain point. When I was younger, at some point me and my brother wanted a dog. Of course, our family was always busy so we didn't have the proper life style to take care of a dog, but we got one anyway. Predictably, me being the dumb kid that I was; I tried to get sympathy points for it by telling about it on yahoo answers because my mom was an animal abuser; and anytime I tried to tell her what she was doing was wrong would end up with us breaking out into having arguments (with her telling me im wrong and that she is right and ""that she knows more about how to take care of animals then I do""). She often yelled at and hit our dog, our dog really only spent her days cooped up in the kitchen because me and my siblings were at school, and my parents were always working. I was the only one that ever came home after school (my brother and sister were usually always out doing their own thing, if they were home they ignored the pets generally). The dog became my sole responsibility because my brother didn't care, and I had a bunch of angry pet owners calling me scum of the earth on an internet forum. It affected my mental health negatively for years, and gave me a lot of internal guilt and mental baggage; and yes, I wasn't perfect of course. Thus, which is why I tried to do something about it (I felt inherently hypocritical for condemning my family but me also not doing anything to fix the problem). Regardless, I still always felt like I was a bad person. For a couple of years, I self sabotaged my own happiness a lot because I felt like I didn't deserve it as long as my pets were suffering and I couldn't solve the problem.

In retrospect, I made that post because I had none of my own real independence; I felt like I had no control over my life as a kid, and obviously I did not have the income my parents had to give the pets a better quality of life (and anytime I suggested a trainer for our dog in a relevant conversation, she would say my dog ""was a lost cause"").

In a poorly worded way, what I was trying to do was ask for help in that post, but I guess I didn't deserve it. All I could do to get her out of the house was walking her daily, which I did, but not until I was 17 because I was meek and non-confrontational. My parents wouldn't let me out of the house because they felt like I was too dumb to not simply look both ways for cars and not get run over. I could've objected and did it anyway when I was younger; but I didn't want to rebel against my parents now did I? Because with the history I previously established, you should understand I was terrified of them; specifically my mother.


Chapter 3: My Later Years, and The Ensuing Downward Spiral

Eventually, my sister would get another dog for herself sometime in 2018, and eventually continue to neglect that dog too. So, I was taking care of both pets at some point plus my cat and also trying to worry about school, while my siblings were out with friends and living their lives. With me, I had to focus on much more responsibility then anybody had thought I was; which I put upon myself because I felt like I had to, even when my parents told me not to worry about the dogs. On top of that, I had to do the house chores and keep my mom from popping a vein everyday.

That is not the end of it, either. During this time, I was in high school. Things would only get worse from here, and my mental health would continue to plummet well into college.

Like I talked about before; if you have cared enough to read this far (which I don't blame anyone if they stopped reading at this point) I had no friends in high school.

While my male classmates in my video production 'shop' (I went to a vocational high school where specialized classes were called ""shops"") talked about nothing except mainly about sports; I was a nerd. At that age, I never really grew up out of childish hobbies like watching cartoons and liking video games that weren't seen as normal, and I was very self concious about that (and attributed to the fact I felt like those interests were very autism coded and thusly were negative traits of me to have). On the other hand, I also didn't like the idea of becoming someone I wasn't and pretending to put on this fake mask for people, which sounded mentally exhausting and not fulfilling to me, so I kept to myself in high school.

In the meantime, I was also picking up exercising and desperately trying to improve my self image, because I hated myself and my appearance back in high school. Around this time, I also started developing a bad porn addiction, and naturally it would worsen overtime always being home with nobody really to intervene or tell me what I was doing was fucking my brain up. I also discovered Kiwi Farms at this point as well (which coincidentally has a thread about SaSu as well), which is a drama site that documented the lives of and gossiped about online internet figures. However, as well along with that it had a thread often discussing and hating on autistic people, often dehumanizing them and saying some of the most awful things imaginable a stranger could say about other human beings. This was a thread I often doomscrolled on, and despite these just being random strangers, I still regardless took to heart what they said. I hated myself because I felt like all the negative qualities they talked about applied to me; they were right. This aspect of my life is sadly only my fault, and I continued to listen to what they said. But I did anyway, because my real life experiences painted my perception of myself, and my self esteem was already in the trash to begin with.

I hated myself inside and out. I was short, ugly, had bad acne and I was a quiet kid; so I always gave off this air to people that I was weird and a person nobody wanted to be around; a kid in high school said I looked like a school shooter. My hair was always greasy because I guess I was too stupid and never washed it right. One of the worst memories I ever had was my mom criticising me that I stunk because my clothes always had a bad smell clinging to them; probably because I only ever worked out in my room, and I was always bloated and gassy as a kid because I was always overeating so I could desperately gain muscle and improve my body that I hated, but I was too stupid and noseblind to notice that I was a smelly, unkempt, unselfaware autistic sped to everyone around me. I was always tired everyday because I'd stay up sleepless nights with racing thoughts and guilt.

When I turned 18, I discovered the whole femboy fad thing that was starting to get attention online. I really wanted to be a femboy, but I knew I was ugly; I barely even took good care of myself, and even despite my efforts to take better care of myself, it seems like even to my mom that wasn't good enough, let alone her ever actually complimenting me or building me up mentally. I wasn't worthy to be considered normal like everyone else. Obviously because my mom deemed me a dumb smelly weird male, she never supported me wanting to be feminine; and I guess I can't blame her. My sister wasn't very supportive either.

In retrospect, I think I only ever wanted to be a femboy because I wanted to be seen as desired when largely my whole life I've felt rejected outside of the few friends I made (and eventually lost). This desire was also due to hating my toxic masculine traits (I had a lot of self guilt over my gender) that I wanted to do anything to get away from myself as much as possible; to be someone better.

Regardless, it wasn't enough. I passed high school largely an average B student, but as college got harder, my mental health continued to spiral. I failed the placement tests high school was supposed to prepare me for, and third semester onward I started failing my classes. In restrospect, i probably have what is now untreated ADHD and probably some form of hypersexuality (which I also talked about in a previous post: trigger warning: it involved SA when I was young). At some point, my porn addiction got so bad I was consuming loli hentai (drawn porn depicting underage characters), it was bad (I eventually quit cold turkey when I was 18, but the damage still had been done at that point). I hated myself to my core, and that was around the time my suicidal thoughts started developing. My anhedonia was already in full swing in high school, but it only worsened. I didn't deserve happiness. I deserved to suffer for the way I was. This is the reason why I never asked for help or told anybody my problems. I felt like I was such a bad person and I was scared. In 2015, when I was in middle school, I had a chance to turn things around. I had a really nice supportive therapist, but I felt too scared and ashamed to even tell her my problems. I guess that was my fault too. I could of lived a way better life.


Chapter 5: Current Day, Regrets and An Empty Feeling

All of this to say that all of the bad stuff that happened in my life was largely my fault. Sadly, due to nature or nurture; I couldn't think for myself. I hated myself so much I basically caused my own undoing.

These days, I barely have the motivation to do anything anymore. I wasted all of those years of my life and failed at every dream I ever wanted to accomplish. I do nothing except sleep in bed all day and get up only when I'm hungry and I need to eat something.

I never became the best self I wanted to be.

I never provided the best life for my pets after they died. I could never prove to my mother I could provide them a better life than she could.

I never moved out, got a job or became independent because I was failing at college.

I never learned Spanish like I wanted to, because I was always insecure about it because some people in my family could speak it, but I couldn't. My sister would tease me about pronouncing spanish words ""like a white guy"". I never proved her wrong. I always wanted to learn spanish just to spite her.

I never even got to explore the world, as I had dreams of doing. I was too mentally ill for that. I couldn't even pass remedial math classes in college.

These days, my sister is everything im not. She was a straight A student in school, she has friends, is popular, and is liked by everyone and is born normal. She already has a boyfriend at 17, and I suppose she has to be at least decently attractive unlike me (and also an actual likeable personality it seems).

I wanted a cute boyfriend when I was young. That never happened either, I was an ugly shut in. I've failed at everything I've ever wanted. I gained feelings for a friend back during the COVID pandemic. I knew him previously, and we always got along. We'd talk on skype everyday, and we talked to each other everyday for two years, he was someone that was a part of my older group of middle school friends I had that I reunited with after they graduated. We continued to keep in touch on discord under quarantine, and I talked with them on discord every night, and we'd hang out in person often too. Even though I was failing at college, those were a few of the only good times in my life. Anyway; I gained feelings for my friend, but he didn't like me back. After I left the friend group over drama, I heard through someone else that he started dating another guy in my friend group; after he previously told me he ""didn't like guys that way"".

Im 23 now, and that part of my life is gone now. Sometime back in january of 2023, I was up late one night just crying in bed, having a mental breakdown over the sudden realization of how much older I am now, and how many years have passed. While my sister gets to live the typical nice teenager life, she lectures to me about ""needing to take life seriously now and start doing adult things/become an adult"". I hate it. I didn't really get to experience happiness and all this success when I was her age, and now I have to all of a sudden cut my losses and become a super serious adult now. I don't feel like an adult, I am afraid of growing old and ugly. I feel like im going to die alone. I recently got into an argument with my family, I blew up on my mother because I also developed anger issues a few years prior because I'd bottle up my feelings, along with being emotionally neglected. My parents told me I was ungrateful and delusional. My sister and my mom tell me everything is my fault, and they claim I'm just trying to redirect blame onto them after they asked me what they could've done to help. I guess they never had a single hand in my upbringing whatsoever.


~


I don't know how to conclude this. I'm thankful if you even read all of that. All I ever wanted was to be loved and accepted.

Above as else, all I've ever wanted is someone to finally understand my pain, hence why this post is so long. I always felt like my problems never mattered and were simply ""first world problems"". Is it my fault I never told anyone? I guess so. I guess I deserve to suffer.

All this to say, I just want to finally go in peace. I've suffered enough. I just desperately want to not exist anymore.

Maybe I'll CTB after this post, idk.

Everything is my fault (an incredibly long vent thread about my life).,2631122,Andro_USYD,"Aug 14, 2024 at 4:25 AM","As I read this I notice (as someone with autism & ADHD) I notice that I experienced things very similarly to you. Before I became a med-head and started using antidepressants, ADHD meds and a lot more a lot of my childhood was much the same, I never really felt like I fit in, (even today) at uni I can never work well with people I have to be in my ""safe zone"" at home to think properly.

My parents also thought I would be hit by a car or something if I went out and I guess we're overly protective of me thinking I'm just a full on idiot. They took my car away, yet my sister who is 5 years younger than me and doesn't suffer the same symptoms is allowed to drive - my dad legitimately gave me 100$ and made my car into scrap metal...

Then I too was overly sensitive when I was younger, the trick with that is nothing special it was just to increase the antidepressants (and be a zombie kinda). (If that's even better)

Anhedonia is honestly a huge issue for me today and I just can't get a break from it (don't know if it's an autism thing but I experience that as well).

Now this advice may seem unconventional but you mentioned you thought you had ADHD: I also think this is the case; also the way you describe being able to ""do nothing but stay in bed all day"", this is a serious sign that you are lacking dopamine and this is a much bigger problem than I think you realise...which is what ADHD is (dopamine deficiency). Also couple that with autism and I think your focus is honestly really bad. You'll find that things like socialising with family and wordiness (because I know you and you're not a wordy person) these things can be changed if you just concentrate all your efforts, get all the energy you can possibly come up with and just see a psychiatrist zigs, tell them you're not doing anything in your day but sleeping and eating and that you just can't function. I wish I could stress the importance that meds can play on a neurodivergent mind.

Because the fact is it's going to take some really hard effort to get out of this world, survival instincts are such a ""nuisance"" I know. And perhaps you'll be able to accomplish a lot more if you were just on the medication that you need. ADHD is debilitating anyone who's ever experienced it would testify to that after trying ADD meds. I know it's hard for you to fathom but this type of medication (just trust me) will have you feeling lively.


It's just about your neurochemistry, you and I were dealt a pretty shit hand and I both (autism, poor concentration etc.) and I know a lot of people do not take such a ""pro-meds"" stance than I do but it fixed my life... Imagine a pianist trying to play a piano, if the instrument is damaged or out of tune you will not be able to play good music because your instrument is broken (the brain). But if you fix this up, (and there are meds for autism as well (rispiridone)) you won't have to try as hard to play better music because your ""piano"" (brain) that filters your thoughts will have more serotonin, more dopamine, more norpenethrine, balanced seretonin etc. Some dismiss it as pseudoscience but I've first hand experienced the difference it makes and can tell you: if you have any energy left see a psychiatrist and get it diagnosed, up the antidepressants you take (because you're on a very low dosage of Prozac). Just think about it, you're feeling at rock bottom right now.... You have nothing to lose by trying ADD meds and upping Ur Prozac dose, but everything to gain...Ur already on death row pretty much and whenever I talk to U Ur planning how to get out of your body.

When I was 17-18 I saved up all my money to see a psychiatrist and get the diagnosis that I needed, we could probably look for psychiatrist's in your area or I will do it to skip some of the work for you.

And I'm not sure if this applies to you but: there's nothing to be afraid of taking meds (unless you're on opioids or benzos) because you can always change your mind and stop taking them if you're finding they aren't helping (but I think they really will). Just remember to use them correctly. I feel like you have trouble getting your words out of your head and expressing your feelings and you don't show this to doctors etc. But because you don't they never know what's wrong with you.


Thankyou for your post it was good to read through and like that other guy said I don't actually think you look bad either. It's okay to desire the things you do and there's nothing wrong with you as a person, I'm sorry your mum and teachers used to shout at you and for all that other stuff. Particularly when you have a sensitive nature that is really bad and may have shaped you to be more reserved. I also used to get the same treatment by some teachers but we're through that stage now so we can be thankful that we don't have to endure any more of that.

You are obviously talented with writing and expressing yourself. I am not autistic but I can relate in so many ways. Both my parents were narcissistic, and my sister was the golden child and I was the scapegoat. It sounds like you had been brought up in a similar toxic environment. I am a lot older than you though. I wish I had been aware of and seen these toxic behavious when I was younger, my life may of turned out differently. Instead I believed all the bull they feed me for way too long, that it was all my fault and I was a failure. When we believe this, it can become a self fulfilling prophecy.

It saddens me that you think you are to blame. But when I read your words, I don't get that at all. I get that you are a caring, sensitive person who didn't have the nurturing you needed as a child, especially with your autism which makes it even harder for you to function in this competitive dog eat dog world. I understand that you feel you let those dogs down too, but I believe they knew your pain and that you tried the best you could at the time. I think they would be very grateful.

I understand that you want to go, you have suffered so much and you really need a change of atmosphere. You need people to build you up, not knock you down, to acknowledge and see you for who you really are. I believe you are young and things can still turn around. Whatever you choose, please be kind to yourself. I know it can be hard when we have been bullied and put down for so long, but try to give yourself some deserved credit and stop taking the blame for so many things that are and have been out of your control.

"My thoughts on the quote ""live to spite your enemies""",2632680,ijustwishtodie,"Aug 15, 2024 at 8:56 AM","I should clarify that this is in the suicide discussion section rather than the recovery session which means that it should be self explanatory that I'm not going to say good things about the quote. If the quote makes you want to survive, fair enough but don't expect to see any positive stuff about it here.

I used to think that I didn't have any enemies until yesterday when something happened which made me recall my primary and high school bullies. I honestly tried to keep them out of my memory for as long as possible but I remembered them yesterday and how I gotten verbally bullied by them. I think that they should be considered as my enemies. I hate them as they ruined my childhood. My childhood could have been the best it could have been and I could have genuinely enjoyed my childhood but I didn't because I was bullied throughout it for my appearance and my voice.

I have enemies but I've learnt that I don't need to live to spite them for a reason. The reason is due to the fact that I don't need to do anything to make my enemies suffer since life will make them suffer anyways. Now this wouldn't be true if your enemy is a billionaire like elon musk or somebody in the government like rishi sunak or joe biden but, chances are, our enemies, if we have any, are normies and are within the 99% of humanity.

This means that you don't have to do anything to make your enemies suffer since life itself will make them suffer. Life itself will cause them to wage slave miserably for decades and then contract dementia or alzheimers during old age which will make them suffer a high magnitude. They may say that they enjoy life and like capitalism but this is just cognitive dissonance as they'll complain about their situation anonymously online. It's like how social media is used to look the happiest you've ever been when it's all just fake. Society is fake and they will always lie to themselves and to others.

In truth, they will suffer and that makes me really pleased. I learnt yesterday that some people may prefer a more... graphic approach to dealing with their enemies but it honestly isn't necessary. Sometimes, the best sort of action is inaction and this is the case here. You don't need to live to spite your enemies since they will live miserable lives anyway.

I should mention that there's a caveat here though which is the fact that anybody who views me as their enemy can equally take solace in how I'm forced to be miserable in life because I don't have the courage to kill myself. Who knows if I even have any enemies but, if I have learnt anything from seeing @FuneralCry as well as from famous social media influencers, it's that some people manage to acquire enemies simply by existing so I'm probably the same.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"My thoughts on the quote ""live to spite your enemies""",2632688,derpyderpins,"Aug 15, 2024 at 9:04 AM","I am with you in disliking this quote, though with a different explanation. I think I've said on here that part of the reason I was living was - at one point - spite, so I'm guilty of it, but I've changed my view.

Hate is a complete waste of energy. Hating ""enemies"", looking to spite or hurt them. . . it's futile. First, if hurting someone makes you feel better, then your pleasure sensors are screwed up and you can't feel real fulfillment and joy anyway. Second, unfortunately, you simply existing probably doesn't affect their day-to-day that much.

I'm in favor of ctb being an option but I think we should always be working to lessen our misery - through ctb or otherwise. Spite, anger, and hatred only increase misery, so I agree it is not a good principle on which recovery should be built. Like many cliche'd pieces of advice, it's designed to stop you from ctb'ing in the moment, not for actually helping you build a foundation for a worthwhile life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

As a guy who's considered at least somewhat attractive by both women (and even other dudes), I've had plenty of opportunities. Unfortunately, I have an insurmountable aversion to intimacy and vulnerability that causes me to impulsively self-sabotage any chance presented to me. Even when I was briefly involved in a romantic relationship at around 19, I was too personally inhibited and deliberately dismissed any romantic advances that would likely escalate into sex.

I have no desire for sex for some reason (I guess that makes me an asexual but I don't really look into all that) but apart from that, this is exactly how I feel. Even seeing pictures on the internet of girls agonises me to a degree that others just don't understand.

It baffles me really, because I find the people that post them are usually people who also can't get them, yet they seem to find great pleasure in posting them for some reason. I'm like 'how are you not experiencing pain from looking at these girls!? That you know you can never have!?' and they just say 'These girls have brought me immense joy in life!'

I find it fascinating. It causes me so much agony every time I see a girl I find beautiful, knowing I could never be with her, yet other people are.",1832264,,,,,,,,,,,,

It doesn't really matter, because when your circumsition gives you 5mm of inner foreskin left unlike normal ""high cut"" circumsitions you barely feel anything down there. I'll never know what it feels like. And SSRI took away my already weak orgasms. Any sexual pleasure I feel is mental and periodical, not steady. I used to think people were simply exaggerating about masturbation and sex. Turns out it's genuinely supposed to feel good. For me it's just releaving. Like food without taste, so you just have texture and the idea of satisfying your hunger. Also I doubt I'd deel anything without a condom and I have to Concentrate super hard mentally to feel anything if I just ignore it and let myself be touched it's like touching my arm. Any moan I make is purely from anticipation and relief but it always feels unsatisfying like something is missing and then my body just demands more. It sucks because my body seems to get aroused by anything slightly intimate very quickly yet I have no way to really satisfy it and also it triggers the shit out of my pure ocd.

Then there's my male body. The thought of someone being attracted to me for my male body disgusts me once it gets to a real, personal level. Interacting with people sexually as a male disgusts me. It feels off and unnatural. Especially if they emphasize me being opposite.

I recently at age 26 had a sort of oppertunity but stopped right before it really happened because it turns out that despite my remaining libido, I actually find sex rather repulsive, both physically and existentially. I may crave it in one sense, but good luck with actually realizing it...Seems like I only crave it in unrealistic fantasy, and it's not like I can satisfy my libido anyway with this little sensitivity. Also, my oppertunity was with a guy. Women do not seem to find me all that interesting as someone other than a friend. They just don't. And something is just heavily wrong with me. Most people I know have had relationships and dates or mutual attraction. I haven't. I fucked up somewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
