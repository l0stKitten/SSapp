Marriage before CTB,2589889,EscapeFromLife,"Jul 8, 2024 at 6:12 PM","Is getting married before CTB a good idea? Perhaps it can be a way of recovery--- but that's very HARD. Has anyone experienced it?

Probably getting married would make things worse-- for the existing issues that are leading to CTB. So, getting married can just make things more complicated. For example, the CTB can lead investigations to the in-laws and partner, whereas doing CTB when single may only lead investigations to own parents. But, I think leaving a suicide note saying ""No one is responsible for by death"" beside the body may resue everyone from investigation. What do you think?",,,,,,,,

Other people are not responsible for your happiness. Having mental health difficulties, and then getting married doesn't magically make that go away.

How much does a 9mm gun in the mouth mess up the appearance of your face?,2600032,akwa,"Jul 17, 2024 at 8:43 PM","How much does a 9mm gun in the mouth mess up the appearance of your face?

I'm not worried for myself, but for my next of kin forced to identify my body. Just thinking about the logistics. I plan to leave my ID.

Will my family still need to identify my body? I will be shooting myself away from the home.

If yes, how messed up will my face be? I am worrying about the psychological trauma for them... Could they identify me through other means, such as a birthmark on my leg?

Me living with overprotective asian parents is so annoying,2598323,ijustwishtodie,"Jul 16, 2024 at 9:48 AM","I hate at how overprotective they are as it makes it even more unlikely for me to ctb. For those who are unaware, not every culture has it where parents kick their child out as soon as they are 18. Some cultures have it where the parents make their child stay with them beyond 18. My parents are an example of this as they don't want me to be independent yet. I live with them despite being an adult and they always keep an eye on me. I can't leave the house without giving them a reason for it first nor can I leave the house during night time either due to my parents being light sleepers. And, no, don't tell me to just go outside anyway... that wouldn't work in asian culture.

This is a big deal for me because this further reduces my chances of killing myself. I just want to be dead so that I don't have to deal with life but killing myself is literally almost impossible for me. Despite me not wage slaving, I still am a slave in a lot of other ways. I'm forced to do things I don't want to do such as religious bullshit, chores, going outside with family and so on. I'm also a slave in the sense that I'm forced to survive in a life that I never wanted to begin with.

I hate the idea of independence and I don't want to be fully independent but it would be nice if I could be independent enough to where I don't have to deal with my parents reducing my chances of being dead. Though, I don't have the skills nor motivation to be independent. I just want to skip all of this bs and be dead already. I just want peace.

I really relate to what @locked*n*loaded said about FC being homebound as I'm in the same situation. Ever since he made that post, I've been thinking about it everyday and today I gained the courage to post about it. This is his post that I'm referring to:

I have to say I miss FC’s never ending posts about hating existence, I wonder why I don’t see them anymore, I know some people were annoyed but I understood her pain and her hatred of existence.

You know I'm Asian too but I'm lucky in that I only have one parent that I live with but I still have to check in with her anytime I want to go out or deviate from my routine in any way.

I think the only way for people like us to gain some temporary freedom is to accept a little bit of wageslavery at least just long enough to gain independence from our parents. This is more like indentured servitude in practice but the idea is still there. At least working in a part time job long enough until you can afford some better methods or even just a trip to Sweden or Denmark or whichever country had the suicide chambers seems like a good way out but I understand if this is still impossible for you as well.

Funnily enough, my asian parents are the absolute opposite and barely cared about my existence, problems or life. They only wanted to make money for themselves and left me alone to care for myself when I was 15, while they worked around the country. They barely messaged, never worried about my health, studies, career, relationship, etc. They barely know me at all, I graduated alone and always celebrated my birthdays alone. I needed to provide for myself when I barely knew how to when I was so young. They would barely provide any assistance financially even for my deteriorating health. Then I ended up having a chronic health condition that will disable me as a result of all the stress and physical work.

A genuine question for discussion,2599867,matheus,"Jul 17, 2024 at 5:52 PM","In a death due to being run over by a train directly to the skull and jumping from a very tall building, which would bring a quicker and more painless death?

A genuine question for discussion,2599873,KillingPain267,"Jul 17, 2024 at 5:58 PM","If we assume the train decapitates your head clean off, and the jumping results in your head hitting the ground directly from enough height, it would be about the same. Your brain would physically cease functioning within a second or two. But the decapitation by train might take slightly longer assuming it cut your neck rather than crushed your skull (since being cut off from the heart and lungs results in hypoxia), while smashing into the ground results in all cognitive functioning ceasing immediately. If your brain stem and thalamus survives the impact of hitting the ground from a jump, you may be conscious for a little while just like with the train decapitation though.",,,,,,,,
A genuine question for discussion,2599903,FallingGrace,"Jul 17, 2024 at 6:18 PM","I wouldn't do either but if I had to pick, I'd for sure go train.
Jumping:
Risk of tumbling during free fall, re-positioning the body to feet-first rather than head-first
Risk of intervention (roof access, good Samaritans below and above)
Risk of environment below changing during attempt, especially in urban area (cars or people, killing bystanders, concrete becoming more shock-absorptive metal slightly increases chances of survival)
Risk of environment below impeding death (impalement on an otherwise unseen obstacle would lead to a considerably slower death)
Time spent free-falling may in itself could be considered painful
Messy but can be somewhat contained depending on the area done in
Time: relatively quick. If unseen, SI can be handled on your own clock and then it's a matter of seconds when you've jumped, granted you jumped high enough to cause fatal injuries.
Train:
High lethality if done correctly (positioning neck over track etc)
Train cannot be stopped easily/long break distance, reducing intervention risk
Minimal risk of killing any bystanders (just mentally scarring them, I guess)
Messy for everyone involved (especially so if you just straight up jump full body in front of one)
Time: complicated. Trains have differing frequencies depending where you are, or a station vs just a random line. They are also protected by trespassing laws. Once you do it though, I imagine it's lights out pretty quickly unless you fuck it up.
Hope that helps",,,,,,,,

I'd choose one away from the engine though. Neck right on the track in front of a wheel.

PSSD is one of the cruelest thing on earth,2270826,phersper,"Dec 9, 2023 at 4:05 PM","I wasn't warned, I wasn't warned by my psychiatrist that I could end up like that, agonizing every minute of every second of every single day.

Antidepressants and other psych drugs damaged my brain and put me in a position I wouldn't wish not even to my worst enemy.

My sexuality has been obliterated: total loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced sensitivity in genitalia, pleasureless orgasms. Sadly that's just the tip of the iceberg. The main problem here is that my body cannot produce any kind of pleasurable feeling because of the malfunctioning of the brain reward system. I know it seems like it can't be real, but trust me, I can't really enjoy not even a single thing in my life because my reward/dopamine pathaway has been somehow altered. I can't feel hungry or enjoy a (good) meal, I can't feel the endorphins rush/good sensations after a sport session, I can't feel the effect of most drugs (coffee, nicotine, alcohol, heroin, you name it…). My body is always in a state of tension (or light akathisia) thus I never ever fully relax, no matter how hard I worked or did exercise that day, I have persistent insomnia and my sleep is more like a shift in consciousness than real deep resting sleep. I'm always weak and tired. Except for some rare bursts of rage or sadness, I lost my emotional range, I can't really feel emotional pain, true sadness, joy, happiness, tranquility. There's no atmosphere anymore in the world, everything became grey, muted. There's no motivation, no drive, no emotions, no pleasure in every activity I once loved, like spending time with my friends and family, go out for a drink, cuddling my beloved dog, playing my favourite sports, watching my favourite movies, reading a good book, getting a full body massage, hiking in the beautiful swiss alps, etc. (the list has no end). On top of that I also suffer from a certain degree of cognitive decline, I struggle to read, sometimes I stumble upon words, I can't concentrate, I really feel like I lost part of my intelligence and I'm definitely not as brilliant as I used to be. I had to quit University 6 months prior to get my master's degree because my brain was not capable to perform at the required level.

It's been a year I'm off the meds which caused me pssd and everything almost stayed the same. Some things have slightly improved, others got worse. What is clear is that I became an empty shell, the shadow of my former self, a dead soul in a living body.
I really want to live because I had everything I wished for before I got PSSD (and believe me, I worked very hard and I overcame loads of shit just to get to that point), but at the same time I want to die as badly as I can. In these last months, where I had a bit more physical energy I tried to do regular exercise, to be socially more active, to better my diet, to force my self to have a more positive look at the future. But still, no matter the efforts, there's never some sort of reward or real improvements in my condition. I've been severely anxious and depressed in the past, but that was a walk in the park compared to this full blown PSSD. Today, in the first place, my brain does not produce the required neurotransmitters in order to be goal driven, to have motivation, to enjoy things. Second of all, even if I put all my effort in order to be active and take part in different activities, there's not even a single drop of reward in return.

So what's the point of going on? I really can't get it. I don't know if you, reading this post, can grasp how hard and strenuous and depressing is to live with this condition, but I really hope you do.
I always fought hard in my life, no matter what, if I had to overcome an obstacle or if I wanted something, I always worked twice as harder as the others in order to reach my goal. But now… now even if I put all my effort, even if I give my 1000% to better my situation, the outcome will always be the same, no positive change, outcome or temporary feeling whatsoever.

As most people with PSSD I've been gaslighted by every psychiatrists. I even attempted to unalive myself once and I've been labelled as psychotic (even though I clearly wasn't) in a matter of minutes from the psychiatrist at the state mental hospital. There I was given tons of antipsychotics to the point I was barely able to talk, walk straight, keep my vision from going double, swallow food, tap on the iPhone keyboard, writing, sit still, etc.

Anyway the bad story is not over, I could go on recalling all the shit and the injustices I had to face in the last twelve months, because of pssd and because of being wrongly labelled as psychotic and forced on strong medications, but that's not the point of my thread.

Actually, I don't know what's the purpose of this post. I guess I'm looking for some sort of approval for my decision of ending it all… but most likely I just need to vent, to tell somebody how tired and agonizing I am.

I believe in reincarnation and I've been thought that ctb is never a solution, but gosh, that's just too much to tolerate. I look at my situation as if I was prisoner who's physically tortured daily since one year and who finally managed to fabricate a rope to hang himself in his cell, how could God blame (or punish) this poor prisoner for taking his own life?

I'm sorry for the lack of introduction or conclusion to this text, I hope it's not confusing. The thing is that I'm just venting, putting my flow of sad thoughts into words.

I wish everybody here to recover and go back to live their life to the fullest leaving suicidal ideations as a thing of the past, but just one last thing: please be careful when it comes to psychiatric drugs, think twice before starting any therapy, look up all the possible (short and long term) side effects, discuss it seriously with your entourage and make a true informed choice. Don't risk to waste your life as I sadly did.",,,,,,,,

I think it, along with the plethora of other SSRIs under the sun that I have tried, has finally messed up my dopamine pathways as well, where anhedonia has set in. Adderall used to be the supreme anti-depressant that I could instantly feel the effects of, but sadly that is no longer the case.

When I was on Venlafaxine my libidio was completely stripped. But it wasn't such a bad thing because Adderall made me horny as hell. The inability to be sexually aroused was good for my sexual frustrations. Luckily shortly after gettting off it, my libido recovered somewhat.

Ever since I started taking it at night, I have found that I can fall asleep easier and have started having vivid dreams again. They're not always the best dreams, but it is better than before when I wasn;t having any dreams at all.",,,,,,,,
PSSD is one of the cruelest thing on earth,2291813,baabbaabbaab,"Dec 26, 2023 at 11:38 AM","Same as you : PSSD, akathisia, dysautonomia + POTS and an handful of other joyful symptoms and diagnostics. I didn't know that human suffering could reach such a point where suicide is the only answer.

Akathisia should be a perfect reason for assisted suicide, yet, since it's not recognized or diagnosed, it will (and still is) be labelled as a psychiatric disorder though your nervous system has been damaged, injured...

I love life, I had a life ahead of me despite all my troubles...

PSSD is one of the cruelest thing on earth,2399104,Suicidebydeath,"Mar 11, 2024 at 2:17 PM","I think I might have PSSD, I looked at the symptoms here:
Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD) - RxISK
Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) is a condition in which sexual function does not return to normal after the use of SSRIs and related antidepressants.
rxisk.org

And I have most of them except ED and possibly decreased libido. Basically all of the tactile symptoms. It does suck. I think I was on citalopram once, I don't remember if it was before or after, it was a long time ago. It also sucked because it didn't do anything/didn't work anyway. I've reported it a few times:

1. The first time I was told it was normal. So I ignored it for a long time.
2. I spoke to a friend on a social app and he said it wasn't normal. So the second time I reported it I was told it was probably a mental block of stimulus and was told to take a Viagra alternative. Again which did absolutely nothing.
3. I've also mentioned it recently, this time to a male doctor, and he told me to make an appointment about it, I haven't yet.

As far as I can google, it's untreatable and the only thing you can do is prevent getting it in the first place. I basically suffer from full anhedonia and while I can live with that, I think it would've been nice to be able to feel things, and have a bit of motivation too. I don't know whether I got PSSD from drugs (it's possible my family drugged me without my knowledge & consent, I come from abusive family anyway), or something else though. It's possible childhood psych prescribed something which I took maybe once and don't remember too.",,,,,,,,

ANTIEMETIC Guide,2430336,beforeistoolate,"Mar 27, 2024 at 11:03 AM","Some of the most important antiemetic tips I've collected over the last year:

Bland, dry, and crunchy foods, low-fat foods, protein-rich foods, and cold foods to relieve nausea. BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) is a physician-recommended bland diet to manage nausea and vomiting. Ginger can reduce nausea by stimulating the contraction of the stomach muscles and accelerating gastric emptying and intestinal transit of food. Studies have shown ginger extracts reduce the frequency of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients. If you are experiencing nausea, eating starchy foods such as bread, rice, plain noodles, and potatoes can help absorb stomach acids. Avoid acidic fruits such as citrus fruits. Fiber slows gastric emptying.

Demonstrated that dried ginger powder products contained the highest quantity of gingerol-related compounds (7–14 mg/g), followed by fresh ginger (2–2.8 mg/g). Studies recommend a safe daily dose of 1000 mg. 500 mg three times daily for three to five days, and motion sickness 1000 mg for one hour before start of travel. The US Food and Drug Administration generally recognized as safe list states that up to 4 g of ginger can be consumed daily. The effects of ginger were not significantly different from those obtained to metoclopramide.

Avoiding lying down during and after meals, stay upright or gentle exercise for a minimum of 2 hours after eating.

Moreover, we know that bitter taste slows gastric emptying, a correlate of nausea. Bitter taste is strongly sensed by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves.

Avoid excessive physical activity while fasting, because it can increase the risk of getting stomach acid. Avoid acidic foods like citrus fruits, tomato sauce, soda.

On the morning of medical aid in dying, clear liquids, tea, or coffee (with no dairy added) are fine, but not solid foods and especially no fat at all (delays gastric emptying). Large volumes of liquid that may fill the stomach should be strictly avoided. Frequent small sips are allowed. Dehydration causes the stomach to produce more acid, which slows down digestion.

An antiemetic, metoclopramide, was taken by 39 out of the 60 cases during the 24 hours preceding the planned time for self-deliverance, every 6-8 hours a 10 mg tablet. None of them vomited. Vomiting was reported in 2 of the 21 cases without metoclopramide, but in spite of this the patient died. (Netherlands Exit data). The cannabinoid agonists, corticosteroids and benzodiazepines also have antiemetic actions.

When you're dehydrated, it can take about three times as long (45 minutes) for fluids to make their way from the stomach into the bloodstream and to the rest of the body. That's because dehydration causes the stomach to produce more acid, which slows down digestion.",,,,,,,,

Quick question, I would like to go through the SN method and I found an online pharmacy to buy antiemetic drugs. The medications contain the molecule metoclopranide but I don't know if they are very effective.

Including feeling depressed… Getting sunlight in your eyeball during the day helps create vitamin D2 which helps for sleep. As long as you're getting saturated fat in your diet. All hormones are made from fats… including melatonin. Not good to take this as a supplement but very good when your body makes it from cholesterol/D2. Our bodies are amazing if we feed it the right stuff… Also magnesium. It's estimated more than 80% of people at least in the US are deficient because our food supply and the crappy way Americans eat. lol. Anyways you want to eat whole foods and try to limit processed food. Exercise helps of course..

When the reality of my financial situation finally hit, I had trouble sleeping and taking magnesium really really helps. I take magnesium lysinate glycinate. Inexpensive, get on Amazon. Doesn't make you have loose bowels. That's always a plus. Valerian root also helps you fall asleep, it's an herb. Very safe.

Try not to drink coffee after 5 PM. If you must, put a couple L-theanines in it. This is a protein amino acid that can chill you out on its own… It will nullify the caffeine.

* I can't believe I forgot blue light. It is so bad to be exposed to your TV screens pcs and phones within an hour before you want to fall asleep.

but cognitive decline as a result of sleep deprivation differs for many people. for me nutrition and periods of the day play a larger role in my brain fog. for instance, even if i have stayed up for a very long time, i may only get symptoms of brain fog during very specific intervals of the day. the mornings where i had previously stayed up all night are typically very clear to me. in any case, it doesn't usually result in a permanent decrease in your cognitive power (unless you have been awake for a very, very long time). the quickest paregoric would be just to modify your own sleep schedule",,,,,,,,

Prochlorperazine DOSING as AE,2599995,DOHARDTHINGS24,"Jul 17, 2024 at 8:06 PM","Hi
Does anyone have any advice on using Prochlorperazine as an AE??
As in dosing?
I see it is in both Stan's & the bible. I can't use meto due to drug interactions apparently.
And I can't open any links to stuff on here because my ex is still in my iPhone & the rest so I'm only opening pages like Stan's that don't have any additional ""click here"" style links because I don't know what he has access to - I found this week that it was even more than I thought which is sickening, TBH.
I have Prochlorperazine maleate 5mg drugs. 24 tablets. Expired 2021.
It is unlikely I'll be able to get any other AE in my time frame unless the 400mg of quetiapine that I take daily counts.
Stan & the bible say no meds for seasickness - the Prochlorperazine maleate was prescribed for seasickness.
The internet said pills are still good if they're not crumbling or smelly or whatever but can have reduced efficacy. Everyone on here said to do a dry run of whatever AE you choose to see if side effects. I took one of my Prochlorperazine a few days ago - zero side effects - is this good? As in not allergic? Or is this bad? As in they don't work anymore? I did not take any when I was prescribed because they were given to me just in case I got seasick & I didn't get seasick.
Does anyone know the dosing of Prochlorperazine for either the 48 hour regimen or stat dose?? Am hoping for 48 hours but will definitely do stat dose if required.
And on top of what is the normal advice, if I should be taking more or sooner or whatever to counteract how old they are???
Apologies for asking this - I know I keep on saying it over & over but it's true - it's simply not viable or safe for me to do much in the way of independent research. I have no physical or digital privacy & SaSu is my legit only source of both info & support. Which sucks. But you guys have been rock stars.
So if anyone knows what PPH says or anyone else about Prochlorperazine maleate 5mg, please let me know. And without it being a link or anything I have to click.
So sorry. I hate being like this - it goes against every part of me. And I freak out that someone might've already sent me info & be offended or whatever - I have to go back through my threads & convos & write notes - so far I've only managed to write notes on Stan & bible - iPhone plus no privacy plus no safety plus only handwriting plus ADHD plus ill health plus plus plus - it's making this too hard for me. I really am sorry.
So if anyone can flick me something here or privately from a legit source like PPH, I'd be over the goddamn moon. And so very bloody grateful. Please. Thank you. Sorry.",,,,,,,,

good evening, this is in no way a criticism but we are quite a lot of people having been here for 1 year or more waiting for the perfect method, wanting to plan everything, knowing, which means that in the end we spend a lot of time think and ultimately we lack spontaneity
and this blocks us when taking action.

this site is truly EXTRAORDINARY and that's why it allowed people to leave peacefully, particularly with the SN...

I've lurked around for many months. It's a bit distressing to see when young people post about wanting to ctb. Hopefully in many cases it's more about venting. Part of the problem is society and their non-education in understanding passive vs active ideation. Once suicide enters the conversation no one wants to be on the hook emotionally, socially or legally for not getting authorities involved.

The channels for anonymous are few. All I know of is reddit, tis and something for older people. It would probably be a good idea to steer people with passive ideation to a place that isn't mixed with active planners. There is a recovery section here but it's a systemic communication and acceptance problem. I notice on reddit a lot of the posts don't get many replies unless they've downed a bunch of OTC medicine in real time and out come the forces telling them to go to the hospital.",,,,,,,,
Would be dead tonight if I had a place to do it.,2579251,3/4Dead,"Jun 29, 2024 at 2:37 PM","Just so tired.
Done with my parents, done with shitty overwhelming jobs, done with depression and anxiety, done with PTSD, just done with living. If I had a place to go (don't have the money for a hotel at the moment) I would be dying tonight.
Every day is exhausting, it's been this way for years, everything is so pointless. I am so useless. I am a burden.
Am I to work for the rest of my life, hoping it will be worth it one day for the people around me? Am I to be lonely, sad, and tired until I keel over naturally?

I want to be dead, but I know better than to do something stupid and risky. Were ODing reliable I'd down everything I have and split off to a park, or were I less concerned about failure I would jump from a building or a bridge.

Just want to be free of this life. Wishing it could be over.
I'm giving it at least another day or two before I decide whether or not I'll go through with it so soon, and if so how I'll do it. I'm upset now, and I'm sure I'm not entirely thinking straight, I need to give it time, and I need to sell and get rid of my things.

I'm going to try all of the run of the mill advice before committing to anything fully (see some friends, try to get some sun, take a day off etc.) but I really do not see it helping much, since my depression is honestly getting worse by the day.

I've decided I'll construct a plan now, take my time planning (since my original plan to CTB is for much farther into the future and I lack the materials or location for that) to ensure I'm not acting impulsively, getting rid of my things should take a while as I'll have to do it slowly so not to raise any suspission.

I'm currently leaning towards a method but It's rather undignifed, and the only place I could think to do it would be a large park in a tent, where I can easily direct authorities, be away from anyone finding me, and if isolated enough go uninterupted. My city has a large homless population so one new tent in a park wouldn't likely raise suspicion.

I'll do a little research on the method I'm considering and go from there, but dying is almost all I'm thinking about really. Honestly if I had the spare money for some booze or pot that might help me think clearer, im joking a little but a good buzz really might set me back straight. I don't know.

3 Top Fears?,2585878,DefinitelyReady,"Jul 5, 2024 at 5:24 AM","Yeah, prep for making a call or going out is always something I do. I have to visual it and account for things that can happen. So it's like being scared to high dive, or for me even low dive. You have to build up the courage. It sucks; and we have to do this for ""other people"" we don't even know or will never talk to again, which sucks even more. Which pisses me off so that sometimes helps. Anger can be a motivator if correctly used. Identifying how ridiculous a fear is that wtf should I fear it? But you can't just do it the one time. You have to ""practice."" Yeah, practice being a person... I tried edibles (didn't help) but I was microdosing everyday. I told my therapist this and was like, ""So I have to get myself essentially a little ""high"" everyday, just to be a person?"" She didn't think there was anything wrong with that and people do a lot of things to stay sane as a person. I thought ""Well hell. Seth Rogen is talented and successful yet he is like always high so...."" and I didn't even like the edibles.

Social anxiety is very complex. I equate it to performance anxiety. I was always terrified to read aloud when it was ""my turn"" in elementary. Same with public speaking. I could die from high blood pressure if I tried to sing in front of people. Shopping amongst strangers and having them interrupt you doesn't seem all that different to me if you think about it. You're not prepared, people could be staring at you at any moment, or randomly ask if you need anything at any moment. Then you're not prepared and fear takes over and it's hard to concentrate and take in what they're saying, let alone come up with a response on the spot. That's a performance to me. Usually ""normal"" people don't give a damn unless you're in their way. If you look shakey, they may just wonder if you're physically okay... Other people dont think like this. We're tragic lol; or if they do think like this it's to a much less intense degree of stress. It's an art lol, to actively not care. The reasons why we do are nuanced and varied. It's the same in the virtual world. This site can still stress you from the anticipation and ill-percieved judgement and ridicule that may or may not come. All the same rules still apply, just by design of internet rules. Make your own rules. Get pissed off for having such rules forced upon you lol. That can help too lol Old habits die hard, but to me, as a former shy, soft-spoken, repressed/reserved/overly proper gal, these are the easier ones, sure as shit.
Grogginess definitely lowers your inhibitions too lol. That's okay for you, but I've had to watch that in the past

Because I'm in the wrong life, each step forward is a step deeper into the forest of regret. This has caused a curious condition where each day is the worst day of my life due to the cumulative weight of the preceding days. This feeling can even be felt in real time as each moment being worse than the preceding one. I manage to do some healthy behaviors and distract myself from the moment-by-moment torture but the overall day feeling is there. I feel like a racoon with it's paw caught in a trap on the verge of gnawing off it's leg to survive except my life itself is the paw and ""survival"" entails not being here anymore.

Of course this isn't they type of thing I can share with others. Even if I bring up time travel or regrets the subject gets shooed away. I am trying to muster the energy and focus to methodically put my affairs in order. This is sort of a bind because in order to do this I need to recover if I want to ctb in a way I find meets the minimum requires of respectability on my part.

I want help but I refuse to have my rights restricted...,2599020,AgentAlaniKelso,"Jul 16, 2024 at 11:08 PM","I find myself back here again on this page, again hoping for support, but this time for a different reason. In previous posts, I shared what was happening with me and how close I came to finally setting myself (and others) free from the burden of my existence. I look back on those two posts now and it truly breaks my heart to see how bad I was hurting and how desperate I was for ANY kind of connection. Things have improved but I still feel like there is more work to do.

I'm here asking for help. I'm so tired of feeling like things would be better if I were gone. I DONT want to be gone. I want to live to be crusty, old, cantankerous, live for more than a hundred years. I just turned 40 this year (I NEVER thought I would make it to 40...) and the thought of living the next thirty, forty, fifty or more years feeling this way is a torment. In the past, I felt I deserved to feel like my life was worthless and I was worthless. Finally, I know that's not true, I believe in my soul that's not true. But I just cant beat the thought of, ""Just walk over to the safe and pull out the gun - It will be over before you even feel it."" To be honest, these thoughts have been a significant obstacle to me feeling like I can live my life as my true self.

I want help but I know sharing my truth with my PCP or therapist triggers, shall we say, processes that ostensibly are meant to keep someone ""safe."" I've worked in healthcare long enough to know what happens when someone expresses ideation or thoughts of self harm. Hell, in the past it has been ME who has started the ball rolling on involuntary holds and involuntary custody for ""safety."" The systems we have in place to ""help"" result in people losing their rights, losing access to their possessions, losing access to their firearms, losing access to their unrestricted freedom, and potentially losing jobs/housing. The systems that are meant to ""help"" result in MORE hardship and turmoil than if someone simply keeps their mouth shut. And that's bullshit.

I want help but I refuse to have my rights restricted. I'm not losing my job, my guns, my freedom, my livelihood, my lifestyle, my purpose - for me, those restrictions are worse than feeling the way I've felt for the last almost 30 years. I know if I tell my therapist how I truly feel about things that my life will forever change and not for the better. I truly want help but the fear of losing everything I've worked so hard for is holding me back from getting that help.

Does anyone know how I can speak my authentic and real truth (rather than the censored version) without risking everything? Can/should I tell my therapist what my fear is if I tell the ""whole"" truth? I trust her, but all it takes is one call to unravel everything. Any ideas?",,,,,,,,

I can press my carotid arteries but after a few seconds of some lightheadedness, I get too anxious and let my hands go off my neck.

How to make yourself LOOSE CONCIOUSNESS (the choking game?)?,2590984,Illegal Preclear,"Jul 9, 2024 at 6:12 PM","The ""choking game"" is actually one of my biggest inspirations for choosing hanging as my CTB method. Yeah! People not only do it for fun, but some get erotic pleasure out of it! David Carradine literally had an orgasmic hanging. Granted, that wasn't his goal but I wish everyone here who has chosen hanging could have that!

The ""choking game"" is mentioned in the Japanese Suicide Handbook (which I recommend EVERYONE read) - There was a Japanese doctor who was studying hanging to see EXACTLY what it felt like before you died (thank you for your service, doctor!) and he did it to the point of passing out to the point where his fellow doctors had to revive him - but according to this doctor it was very peaceful.

That being said - I think people respond to it differently. There are some people who will feel a rope around their neck and have an automatic panic response. And...there are some, as previously mentioned, who enjoy it to the point of being addicted to it.

As far as my experience goes - I practice with the rope I intend to use when the big day comes - I tie my hair to the side, put the noose right under the jawline, visualizing where the arteries that need closing are, hold the length of rope upward with my dominant hand and let my head hang loose, trying to simulate as close as possible to what the actual hanging will feel like. There's a 'pounding' type feeling that goes along with my pulse and I feel all the veins in my face going wild. I've never done it to the point of passing out, which I NEED to because I'm planning on swinging this September. I'm planning on practicing today again. Last time I decided to see if drinking a bunch of liquor would aid the process - bad idea. I gave myself such a huge migraine. But when I normally do it - the feeling is not exactly comfortable, but not that scary and I can see myself being able to do it until I pass out.

Also - I agree with OP in that the rush of endorphins you get after you let go feels REALLY COOL.",,,,,,,,

If you've got an idea of who will manage your burial (the funeral home or otherwise) you could reach out to them and inquire anon (it might also be on their website if they have one), if you're not sure specifically I'd say look into what's nearby your family that they may decide to use for transportation and burial to get a rough estimate.

Oldest human died in Indonesia aged 146,2228364,DEATH IS FREEDOM,"Nov 7, 2023 at 3:26 PM","The survival instinct keeps life alive. The survival instinct does not want life to die. The society does not want humans to die. Global average life expectancy is 73 years. Humans are now living longer than ever before. The average lifespan of the ancient Greeks and Romans was 20 to 35 years. Modern medicine keeps people alive longer than our ancestors. People have jobs that do not wear out the body. Man has no other enemies than diseases and his fellow men. Human euthanasia is illegal in most countries. Many people think about suicide to avoid pointless suffering. But not everyone succeeds in dying by suicide because suicide is difficult and the body is not made to kill itself. However, if you do not die of suicide, there is the risk of dying of old age. Maybe there are people who want to die of old age, but I myself want to escape this terrible suffering with the ailments of old age and the decay of the body.

According to his papers, Mbah Ghoto in Indonesia, was born in December 1870. But Indonesia only started recording births in 1900. Mbah Ghoto survived four wives and all his children. In the last years of his life they had to wash him and feed him with spoon because he was getting weaker and weaker. Moreover, he could not stand upright because his back was bent. When Mbah Ghoto was 122 years old, he began to prepare for his death and made a tombstone. Mbah Ghoto waited for death for a very long time.

It's also triggering the homophobic violence and abuse and threats I've experienced in the past.

I'm trying to hold things together and not make an impulsive suicide attempt as I've done that already in the last week and like I always say to people on here, it doesn't work. But I have self harmed already this morning and it's only ten o'clock.

I know I've just got to ride it out, that never mind what one part of my brain is telling me, that these are memories not current events but part of what's getting to me is the lack of understanding from other people. None of the LGBTQ+ people I know have experienced anything directly in years and straight people are sympathetic but don't and can't understand the fear of wondering if the person who looks at you for too long in the shop is going to say something, maybe in the car park where it's quiet.

Is it normal to feel this way?,2599700,Qua,"Jul 17, 2024 at 3:09 PM","Around a month ago I stopped taking my antidepressants for a few weeks (I kept forgetting to take them, then didn't have strength) and my mental health spiraled down. I haven't felt this bad for a long time, no breaks, in a few years. Always when I broke down it would last maximum a couple hours. Here, however, without my medication it kept going and kept getting worse with each day.
I'm feeling better now since I started taking my meds again, but here comes the question: why do I want to go back to that state? English is not my first language and so can't wrap in words how bad I've been feeling, how really low I was. I started self harming again, abusing calming medication to drug myself so I don't feel anything. Thoughts of suicide were so loud in my head I think If I hadn't taken my meds again I would've been dead by now.
Of course I still feel bad. I'm still depressed and family issues keep being the biggest and most harmful problem that I can't escape, but I'm nowhere close to the state I've been in before. Why do I want to come back to it? To make myself struggle, to make myself break down completely?

TENT,2589342,Not A Fan,"Jul 8, 2024 at 7:52 AM","Am currently researching this. I want to release Argon in a small tent in an attempt to avoid having to worry about any headgear. Just lay close to the ground where the heavy Argon gas accumulates and should theoretically work similarly to the Sarco (Which uses nitrogen but argon is more available and works just as well. Most important difference is that it is heavier than air, whereas nitrogen is lighter. So argon has more a tendency to pool up near the ground.

I'm actually browsing the tents right now... will return if anything worth sharing comes up.",2589066,,,,,,,
TENT,2589369,cosmicporosity,"Jul 8, 2024 at 8:26 AM","Thank you.

TENT,2589378,Not A Fan,"Jul 8, 2024 at 8:46 AM","It's not really established.. more just a concept I am looking into.

People exploring inert gas, often seem to get hung up on some detail that caused the exit bag not to inflate properly, or the mask doesn't work right or something. It's the kind of of thing where any small oversight could sabotage the entire plan. I've witnessed threads on this forum, of people going back and forth trying to figure out why their setup isn't working. They seem to have done everything correctly, and end up wasting so much gas on failed tests and troubleshooting, trying to figure out why their setup isn't working the same as everyone else's.

I'm reasonably confident I could build a functioning mask apparatus, but I feel like it's also not aesthetically ideal. It doesn't feel natural to put a bag over one's head. The Sarco is one way to avoid this -- you just just sit in it and breathe -- but due to regulatory hurdles, it is unlikely to be available in my country in my lifetime.

Argon's tendency to settle close to the ground means you should be able to lie down in your sleeping bag, and as long as the tent is well-sealed, and enough argon is released, you would basically pass out in a couple breaths... without having to put on a mask or bag. One question on this would be: how quickly would it dissipate? What exactly amount would the minimum needed for a given interior volume (of the tent or other enclosed chamber.)

One thing that has concerned me about argon, unlike nitrogen, people who had tested their exit bags complained on nausea lasting for a few hours after breathing it. But then today I read that when people inhale argon by accident, they're suggested to breathe while hanging upside down in order to expel the heavier-than-air argon that has settled at the bottom of their lungs. That probably causes nausea or dizziness or headaches if you don't take care of it. So it's not that there's anything toxic about argon. It is just as ""inert"" as nitrogen in terms of how it (doesn't) react with your body.

But if you are going unconscious and don't plan on waking up again, that is quite immaterial. But I guess if you don't wanna feel gross after testing your setup, stand on your head for 5 minutes. But it seems like potentially the tent and the argon could be the best of both worlds. Personally I think inert gas hypoxia would be the cleanest death experience... maybe I put too much importance on it though. when youre dead, youre dead",2589369,,,,,,,
TENT,2589395,locked*n*loaded,"Jul 8, 2024 at 9:03 AM","Definitely make sure the tent you choose has an attached groundsheet. Usually, the higher water-repellent tents are thicker material. Even if there's a mesh window, you can seal it. Look into ""gutter sealant"". That stuff is stick beyond belief and can be rolled on with a small roller right over the mesh with a couple coats. Can use it for the seams, too. A tarp thrown over the tent will also help contain the CO, if that's what you're planning. A Malawi has been used successfully before, but it's not that large, which is good and bad. Would need to be careful about knocking over hot buckets of coals.",,,,,,,,

TENT,2589792,locked*n*loaded,"Jul 8, 2024 at 4:42 PM","If it's done right, you really should fall unconscious within seconds. That's if you get the CO level high enough. Obviously, without an analyzer that actually measures and reports a CO amount, you can't know for sure. But, others have been successful without a CO analyzer using much cruder setups. I think the guidelines posted in the Megathread are correct. If followed, there shouldn't be any issues. Personally, I'm counting on no issues, too. Frankly, if you're sitting in the tent for more than a minute, and not falling unconscious, GET OUT, because the CO level is not high enough.",2589633,,,,,,,

New member and first post. I struggle with reading, writing and concentration as my brain hurts and my vision not so good (hard to read with double vision and no corrective lenses). So I've tried to read the rules as best I can and searched best I can but man o man is it exhausting and overwhelming for someone like me.

But I live in Western Canada, big city on the coast of British Columbia to be exact and I am inspired by the MaxDog nitro brewing setup. Lots of kits and whatnot out there to make all sorts of great stuff with the gas, yet I am unsure on where do people like me acquire the gas for such home brew projects ? In the states and elsewhere it all seems really easy, maybe it's easy here too but I'm just missing it.

Any suggestions for where to get my kit started and best size bottle and regulator that is available in my region would be appreciated. I tried looking up regulators but my search just shows me CO2 stuff and it's again, with my learning disabilities it's a massive struggle to wade through this stuff.

Please keep it simple as too much is overwhelming. I' really enjoy gin and I've heard that a nitro infused Gin is super smooth and really brings out the botanical flavours and hopefully I can try it out before I'm homeless once again this Oct.

,2599619,lainpilled,"Jul 17, 2024 at 1:53 PM","Hello SaSu, today I wanted to let some of my feelings out with a post, specifically feeling isolated and alone and generally feeling like everyone ignores your presences; that you feel invisible to everyone around you. I'll likely get into some of my personal trauma, so warning for abuse, neglect, and sexual assault. With that out of the way, time for my rambling.
I've had and still do have the urge to CTB, though I've found reasons as to not do as such. Still, I grew up alone and bullied in an unstable household with no one to turn to and this is still true even when I'm about to turn 20 on the 24th of this month. Despite doing my best to be friendly, kind, funny, smart, strong, and pretty with me getting called that, i still find that I am not enough for people and that I'm doomed to be constantly isolated and it hurts. I don't ask for much yet I feel like the biggest burden in the world, taking up space to the point where my own grandmother called me a waste of space. She's a bitch who removed me from her will because I came out about getting s/a'd by her favorite grandchild. I was a toddler and he was a teen. In school I was considered the weird girl, I was even told this to my face, it's strange because all that was different about me was the fact I was depressed from my parent's constant drinking and having to deal with all the police and blood and my stepdad leaving us. I dealt with too much in life and getting bullied and used in school didn't help. It was highschool when I made some friends, not that i didn't have friends before but we grew apart after middle school. The new friends I found were gamer boys who had never been friends with a girl before, and they all developed crushes on me. To learn my dearest friends were lusting for me, to the point of uploading a song about it on Spotify hurt. It really hurt and I haven't recovered from it. Even now as I try my best to be a good friend, a good sister, a good daughter, I feel as if I'm being used and manipulated by those around me and even with the support I have, I find myself just constantly hurting and lonely. Last night I had a fun time in the chats talking to various people, everyone here is so nice, I feel understood by those here. Thank you.
I didn't expect this post to be this long, but I want to tell people to be there for one another, everyone here is lonely and hurting so please extend kindness to others. <3",,,,,,,,

,2589855,Sylveon,"Jul 8, 2024 at 5:36 PM","I don't know what my incentive is to keep dragging on. I tried everything I think I possibly could have, right from the academics: I went from scoring in single digits in my entrances to being in the top 6 or so percent of my country (not trying to brag, it's nowhere near as cool as it sounds), completely cut off social media, got rid of my binge eating habit completely, tried taking better care of my body, from my ugly face to fitness, learned how to drive (not four-wheelers, but better than nothing, I'd say), tried getting back into video games and art, and what not.

The point is, I put in so much effort just to live normally, and it honestly landed me nowhere. I feel like I'm even worse off than I was before. At least back when I used to waste my days playing video games, I could easily subside these feelings as per my will, but that privilege is long gone. I can't believe it's been three years since even that.

People around me don't have to put in half as much effort; they aren't afraid of social situations; can talk normally without being awkward or coming off as pahtetic or desperate; are actually decent-looking; have friends who actually prefer them; don't make a fuss over the pettiest of stuff; and somehow manage to keep their heads up at all times. Why don't I get any of this? All that effort just to still end up at square one—why should I keep going? I don't even wanna leave my room anymore, but who am I kidding? I'll just be told the same old ""everyone does it, so you'll have to as well,"" ""stop using your phone,"" ""just find a hobby,"" ""we have high hopes for you,"" ""you gotta do this, you gotta do that,"" ""just man up..."" I'm done with all this.

Thanks to God in the past week for reminding me how I have never been and how I will never be someone's first choice. I'm through... I genuinely wanna carve something insane on my skin so that people will leave me alone forever. I may as well commit to being a freak physically too; maybe then I'll never have to deal with life again, as long as I'm still alive.

The shittiest thing I find is that I still feel this pressure that I didn't try hard enough. I guess that comes from parents. But, it's really been getting to me the past year. Like- why am I doing all this? Why am I putting myself through all this? All for the sake of other people basically. So I don't end up a burden on my parents. When, they landed me with all these problems to begin with. I just find it ironic really.

I try to exercise every day because I find it does help me overall but, I hate it! It's just stuff like that that pisses me off about life. Like- yes- it's still a choice. I could just not do it.

They tell you you can't feel guilty forever even when anything else would be insane. That it's possible to stop wondering how that person's doing
And then they insist on arguing you're just depressed or that you're not trying hard enough not to think about it, ostensibly because they care when really it's just their job because they spawned you
Once you make the one person who did care stop, and know it's your fault, it's impossible to care about yourself.
Why should I appreciate ""help"" that is just pills that don't work or make it worse, useless advice on things they dont understand or useless therapy or threats of hospital (despite you telling them over and over what can happen in those places) or restrictions of finances so you can't buy the one temporary escape that ever works? Why should I care what happens after I'm dead, if they're upset? Life's not fair. I didn't ask to be born.

Looking for any advice or opinion on my situation. Strongly considering CTB soon.,2599495,Iloveher,"Jul 17, 2024 at 11:58 AM","Hello , I am 40 male. Most of my life has been a disappointment. Havent achieved much in life really and it feels like life passed me by. However, I have made my peace with this , I embraced nihilism years ago. I have considered CTB for many years, had a few attempts that ended up with me puking out pills or chickening out in the last moment. Anyway, my family's cats (we've had many) have become my only comfort in this dull yet full of suffering world. But even they leave me one by one due to old age or illness which has made me want to wait until the last one leaves me and then end it all.
Anyway this has been my story until a few months ago.

This is when I met HER.
Her , I dont know why the universe put her in my path , until her I knew how it will all play out and I was at peace with it Her, this girl at work , most beautiful girl ive ever seen , most perfect girl from every angle I look at her ,polite , sweet , hard working, etc. I fell in love with her about 2 weeks after I met her. She managed to change my perspective about the world , about life , about everything , just by existing. It feels like I was dead and I got an adrenaline injection in the heart that woke me up to life again. Just imagining being with her brings me so much happiness I cannot express in words , I never even imagined that one can be so happy, I never imagined one can feel like this. She really changed my perspective of life , she made me want to live, want to experience life , even grow old and live life a normie (something I never thought Id ever desire). She did all of this by just existing and being around me at work.
Now the problem. This is not a happy story unfortunatelly.

She is 20 yo , I am 40 yo. (I understand if some will judge , I respect everyone's opinion) Despite the huge age difference (she may not be aware as I really look young , I am also fit Im a gym addict) , she seems to have some interest in me , I caught her looking at me a few times , sometimes when I pass her by she smiles at me , also called me cute once when I helped her with some stuff. I am not saying she wants me but theres def. some interest even if small.
The problem is shes veeeeery beautiful . Almost every guy at work approaches her and gives her attention and she seems to enjoy attention a lot. Which has made me suffer a lot to the point that I was once so hurt because she talked to a guy for about 3 hours that I decided to ignore her and stay away from her , I didnt even want to say hello to her anymore which made her say hello to me 3 times in the same day after I ignored her twice , that has made talk to her again and made me more confident that theres a least a little bit interest on her part. Problem is this isnt enough. I am very convinced I dont have a shot with her despite any interes on her part. Shes too beautiful and popular why would she want me out of all her options ?

I really cant deal with a broken heart , if I ever see her in a relationship with someone I wont be able to cope with it , I was dead and this girl brought me back to life , she made me dream of a life I never dreamed of before. If I cant have that life I dont really want any life, and its very unlikely that I will have her.

I bought rope and I found a tree , I dont know when to do it and I am scared I will chicken out but hopefully I wont.

I welcome any opinion and advice. I want to know what you people would do if you were in my situation. I have nobody to talk to about this but you people so any opinion is appreciated.

You're just an older male colleague to her. She probably doesn't think about you at all. This obsession you have with her is unhealthy.

You can follow advice above and ask her out, like they said, it's worth a shot. But honestly? Expect rejection. I don't say this to push you further towards CTB, I am not trying to do that. Logically, she's probably just trying to be a good colleague to you. You icing her out probably just confused her and made her wonder what she did wrong professionally.

I don't think it's wise to predicate your ctb just based off a woman at work. From your post, sounds like you hardly interact with her beyond simple pleasantries. For instance if she quit, in six months would you still be thinking about her?

I understand though that sometimes we all need a singular reason to just keep on living though and fantasize over to keep us here. Not judging that.

Think about the consequences of asking her out. The rejection itself could hurt, but you might also make your workplace unbearable if she tells other colleagues and dismisses you.",,,,,,,,

Thing is we have a lot of collegues and we could ignore each other if we choose to and it would not affect our work.
I think she has an interest in me because I caught her staring at me more than once , in fact once she was with a friend of hers talking and I was behind them and was looking in another direction , she stared at me a couple of times and her friend noticed it and he stared at me as well. I think her friend likes her and he looked at me in a jealous way.
But I do expect rejection this is why I didnt ask her out or anything, even though once when I talked to her she told me shes said because her friends and her have different schedules and dont get to go out a lot, and that shed like to go out more. At the time I didnt make a deal out of what she said but then I thought if she wasnt trying to get me to ask her out",2599572,,,,,,,

I told this person I don't mix work with my personal life and second of all I am way too old and I would rather that this person be in a relationship their own age with things in common and things they can relate to...this person claims that they have dated enough people and that I was different, that I was someone special and meant a lot to have in their life...and that while they agreed they also doesn't mix work with personal life, what if you were to match with one person in your life and that one person is the one person from work, wouldn't you chance it? I didn't want to because it is frowned upon to have personal relationships in the workplace; if we wanted to try it out, one of us would have to quit or get fired. They said no one is going to care but if it did come down to getting fired, this person would take the risk...we are also in different departments so we don't work directly together...I rejected this person at least 10 times but this person was very persistent and eventually we met for lunch a few times on the weekend outside of work, and it turned out a coworker saw us and reported it to our supervisor. Suddenly, this person denied ever having an interest in me and blamed the whole thing on me claiming I was the one pursuing them! They then blamed me for nearly putting their position at risk. I couldn't believe they lied and it made me want to kill myself because I was perfectly fine being alone. I had never considered a relationship and that person was the one who put the thought in my head and convinced me to try it, that it wouldn't hurt and if it didn't work out then it didn't work out. They were the one in the middle of a breakup...and I guess I was just the re-bound. And less than a month after we were found out, this person has already moved on to another relationship, while I am alone stuck in unspeakable pain and not understanding how that person could have lied and I fell for it and was used. Worst of all, we had agreed we would not tell anyone about the relationship, but this person ended up telling everyone. A mutual friend brought it up to me and asked how I could have fallen into that trap. I said how could I not, this person claimed they had feelings for me and that we were a perfect match. This mutual friend said while they are letting me believe I was in a relationship with them, they actually have a bunch of others they are seeing...and that it's easy for them to quickly be in a new relationship after me because I was nothing more than ""fresh meat"" but now I'm just expired milk. This person led me to think I could have a life with someone I never considered before...then they shattered that hope and dream.

I would hate for you to fall into a similar situation...if I could go back in time, I would have turned this person down. I wish it could have gone back to the way it was, instead of feeling betrayed and now both of us have bad marks on our performance evaluations.

While you pine away for this singular person, she enjoys fielding interest from a variety of potential suiters. While a few drops of attention from her stirs the depths of your soul, she's in an ocean of attention and it doesn't mean any significant thing for her to size you up with some looks. Your drought for romantic interest is an alien concept to her and at some point she will pick up on that and not feel special but instead feel pressured to meet some sort of expectation and recoil.
This being a work environment, it's a potential rumor mill where you can quickly become known as the office creep. If she's so fantastic she probably has a boyfriend or at least one or more fwbs. Are you ready to deal with that and be burdened by imagining her with other men?

I have had a quick look here and found some info on SN but I'm unsure of how to actually do this, I have like 120 sleeping tablets but I'm not sure if that would do anything to me.

Some background on my life: I'm 27, I have had a really hard time with my childhood and adultlife so far with gender dysphoria, I tried transitioning at 18 with the NHS but was put onto their waitlist and pushed back from getting DIY by online forums, after waiting years and years and seeing my body become more and more ogre-like, I tried transitioning at 26 with DIY meds and they had made no difference in how I look, I consider this to be a good effort put into living. Everyone around my age is getting married, buying houses, making loads of friends, while I sit inside playing games and starving myself as a punishment. I felt for the longest time from around 14-26 that I wasn't really alive but I could never really explain why, it's almost like you are dying but you don't really understand why or how, but you just know that you are dying. Like I never knew who I was or what even was wrong with me until it was too late, at 26 my body is too far gone and my life is in too much of a wreak to ever fix it. I think it's time for me to stop living in a fantasy place where I can pass and have a great life as woman, and wakeup to the reality that it's too late. I am just in pain and exhausted from all of the repressing. I just need an escape, a permanent one. I suffocated myself by repressing and now internally I'm too dead to do anything, I have went to A+E before for an attempt and I got released the same day so nobody really cares.

Writing a will and suicide notes, trying to explain my pain to people who never really got me, seems like a task I can't handle. Figuring out how to do it without making a mess for someone else to deal with is more than I can deal with.

I'm drowning in this emptiness, and the thought of getting everything in order before I go is ridiculous. Every move, every thought, every heartbeat just reminds me of how tired and hopeless I am.

I dream about a quiet way out, slipping away without anyone noticing, leaving nothing behind but a faint trace that I was here. But reality is a cruel joke. The final step needs more energy than I've got. I'm stuck in this awful middle ground, too drained to die, too broken to live.

The problem was, unlike other substances that were on offer there, these two users had no single review written about their pentobarbital sales, they did not even have a single successful sale of this specific item shown in their sale history, one of them called it nembutal, and even though they priced it for, I think, 600 dollars per 10 grams, the biggest red flag was that they both claimed to be selling it in powdered form, with pictures of white powder in a plastic bag attached to their posts.

Someone might say I try too much. When I don't, I'm just invisible, a ghost to everyone.

A person from my social circle called me a show-off. Why the fuck would they do that? Because I gave them a present and they thought that was a flex of some sort? What the hell?

I give up. I don't understand people. I'm not made for human interaction.

I volunteered as a board member for a local non-profit and it has done a world of good for me. The feeling I get when I see how much these people value ME is something I've never experienced in my life. Knowing that I am NEEDED by the organization, that I am WANTED at the table, and that my fellow board members VALUE ME has given me purpose.

Obsessing over what you're doing wrong is easy when you're desperate and lonely. People can be selfish, or tired, or have a lot on their plate. They might already have plenty of relationships and don't feel the need to invest in the one they have with you. I personally always feel like I've shown up late to a party and literally everyone's already found someone to talk to. It really is so exhausting and discouraging. Since I'm in the same boat I can't really give advice other than to not force it. People notice your desperation and get uncomfortable.

Made a post about it a while ago. I was always the one who had to push or initiate and wouldn't be included unless numbers required it.

People can be petty and jealous. I also imagine that really wanting to have friends probably gives off similar vibes to someone who is desperate in dating, you know? It's weird.

Personally, presents make me a little uncomfortable because it feels like a debt has been formed, but I wouldn't call you a show-off unless it was in a very joking way and we had established that being flashy was part of your personality. (In a good way.) Tone matters. I could see someone getting a gift and saying to the person giving the gift: ""get a load of this guy! What a show-off, spoiling his friends like this. No, but seriously, though, thank you."" But actually saying it in an angry way just tells me they're not a good match for friendship.

People are hard to understand sometimes. It's important to remember we all have our issues and problems. They are being rude and not explaining themselves . . . maybe it makes them anxious, or they feel guilty. Speculation isn't worth the time. The important thing is to accept, ""alright these people are not cut-out to be my long-term friends.""

I said up front I was the outsider many times. Well, now I'm older and have finally settled in where I know who my friends are. I've purposefully narrowed the list to not have to juggle too much, but I've got a handful of people I trust and who I intend to be friends with long-term. One thing that strikes me as being important is that - like you - I'm the type of person who needs a friend who can tell me honestly when something annoys or upsets them, explain why, and give me a chance to fix it. All of them fit that category. Took a long time to find them.",2596903,2596903,2596903,,,,,
Pretending to be a normie to my family is so difficult,2583620,ijustwishtodie,"Jul 3, 2024 at 7:32 AM","I hate it. I was okay with rotting in bed and doing absolutely nothing but my family aren't okay with this at all. They want me to be productive and to get a job as well as to stop me from rotting in my room all the time. They don't like seeing me in this way and they want me to ""do something with [my] life"". My family asked me ""what do you want to do in life"" and I stayed silent. I want to say to them that I don't want a life at all and that I never wanted a life to begin with but obviously I can't say that to them as they just wouldn't understand. Pretending to be somebody who I'm not is incredibly difficult. I wish I could just say the truth to them and that they'd understand me instantly but they won't. They'll see me as a lunatic when, in actuality, I know that I'm rational in my views.

It's things like this which make me want to stop fantasising about my death and to start in actually obtaining my death as early as possible. I'm not compatible for life and I never wanted to be a human in the first place. Dealing with life is exhausting. Pretending that I want a life is even more exhausting. If only they could understand me, I could tell them the truth. But normies can't comprehend somebody who doesn't want life because, in their view, everybody wants life.

The only people who can actually understand me are on this site which is why I'm venting about it here instead. I'm so frustrated at pretending to be a normie. I'm so frustrated at life itself. I'm so frustrated that I still am alive. I'm just... so frustrated overall",,,,,,,,

You never wanted to be a human in the first place. So why continue to exhaust yourself pretending to be what your not to appease others. It isn't your responsibility to ensure they understand and like you.

I've given myself so many chances and so much time and always return to feeling like shit. I feel guilty for pretending to be ok around my relatives and friends, but my plans cannot be ruined.

Interestingly, you have brainstem instincts which will activate and your unconscious self will try to survive by ""climbing"" and a few minor head/face adjustements.

I use to think suicide was selfish , as friends had taken the plunge. I always sympathized yet , was always the type to say "" real man just deals with it"" I WAS HORRIBLY WRONG. i am currently getting a divorce , for 2 years had problems with wife, now its all over . People think im a tough guy, i intimidate people and have throughout my life been able to exert my will upon my surroundings. I say all this because , here now I can see there are some things that are just too hard . cause too much pain . Anyway buddy , you sound young. there maybe something out there for you. Rarely when people feel they have fucked up so bad or are fucked up so bad is it completely true. while i share your feelings , and am thinking the same as you. I just want you to really be sure , you are not as bad as you think . I do think it is a tragedy to let go as life is short already . Yet again i am wanting to CTB myself. I can still recognize the Beauty the world has to offer. the minute details and rich exquisitness to everything , the simplest thing. I read the posts here , i feel the way i do , yet i feel baad for so many of you . I am 43, i have a daughter that is 18. so,so much can change . so much can happen so quick when your young. I do not know you , nor do i make or want to make the moral argument , i just want to help man . im new to forums etc. but if u want to talk. send me a msg , ill figure out how to see someone did msg . Maybe just wait a bit . Again i am not judging . I understand deeply , the feeling, or not feeling disconnect. But your pain , life and yes even death is tragic friend . feel free to tell me to go fuck myself if u wish too.",,,,,,,,

Neurodivergence poll,2599320,ijustwishtodie,"Jul 17, 2024 at 8:00 AM","Autism and social anxiety.
In addition to this, I think that another reason why autism has so little attention is because of how everybody in society believes that the only type of autistic person to exist are the ones who are hyper genius savant with the social awkwardness. That probably makes them think that autism isn't as bad as it actually is.

Alternatively, I thought of another reason in mind. This reason being that, if they were to focus on autistic people killing themselves, people would recognise some dark truths about society. Most autistic people show as to why society is wrong and also how the system is shitty. Normies need to keep their delusions in check to continue wage slaving but seeing autistic people kill themselves over the system being shitty would shatter their delusions",2598716,,,,,,,

Most people don't want to admit they'd sneer at a weird, lower-functioning autistic kid stimming in the back of the class. You see it all the time in schools- shared glances, snickers, etc.

The US is (thankfully) at a point culturally where outright saying ""you're a genetic defect"" to the disabled and neurodivergent is generally frowned upon, but you can still say ""you're a weirdo"" just fine.

Halatal is not prohibited as it is still the main medication used by vets to put pets into sleep during surgery or put pets into permanent sleep. So no, it is not prohibited. It is sold under prescription and you knew that when you went there. In order to find it without prescription, you have to visit different neighborhoods, smaller towns. You have not provided any specifics on which Lima neighboorhoods and other small towns you visited. So you want help but you don't offer any specific information. I don't trust you.
Next, you come to this forum asking for sources, but you have hardly any post history. You have not participated in discussions, you have not proven genuine intent, you have not engaged in any topics and your post history, your engagement with the forum, with other users, is almost non-existent. You also have not offered any specifics about yourself or the places you tried in Peru.
I personally would also not give you sources.
N is still available in Peru, but you are not going to get sources by calling other people cheating lyers here.
Many people who went to Peru visited small towns in the Amazon and other smaller towns to achieve their objectives. Which part of Peru have you visited so far. You are not sharing any information, you have no post and engagement history, you are sharing incorrect info, and you expect people to share with you sources and put those sources into danger (real danger, we are talking jail).
Calm down and share where did you go in Peru so far. You said ""everywhere"" in one post which is clearly a lie.

Healing but still want to do it in spite of everything?,2596907,Hyes,"Jul 15, 2024 at 5:53 AM","I can definitely say I'm getting better compared to the end of last year. I haven't had serious suicidal thoughts in a while. Where I'm daydreaming about doing it and the orgasmic rush I feel imagining it. I thought turning 21 would be a big change but all it means is I can get alcohol easier and drink way more.

The album I've been working on with a friend is genuinely coming along really well. That should be reason enough to keep going. My friend is the drummer and to each other; we are the only other person we've met that can truly keep up with each other musically. And he's nearly twice my age.

I'm still autistic as shit and bring myself down every chance I get. And I just avoid any social interaction I can. It's kind of weird. If I know what to say before hand, I can speak just fine (ie, talking to cashiers) but I am godawful at being put on the spot. My mind just goes blank and I can't find the words.

quitting my nicotine addiction is so hard. I had been using zyns with my vape but a little over a month ago I threw it away shortly after I bought a new one. In that time, I started to smoke cigarillos and now the problem is just worse. I gotta take 2 zyns at a time to replace what just 1 would feel like. But god the buzz when I'm drunk is worth it. It's no surprise why I feel like shit all the time.

I haven't met anyone new in years. I want to but also don't want to? I've never been in a serious relationship I've been alone so long that I just want to do everything alone. In school? I wanted to do all my work alone because it was faster and easier. I guess that hasn't changed. It's hard to work on myself when there is no one to do it for. There's so much about relationships that I don't know and I know it's gonna be a problem for any potential partner I find. (How long do I wait to get intimate? When can I start asking personal questions?) it's hard to form connections when it seems like every question I can ask I too personal and it'd be rude to.

I'm sorry this post isn't as focused as I wanted it to be. Tl;dr I feel like shit and everything I do still makes me feel like shit",,,,,,,,

I'm autistic too and can really relate to going blank in social interactions and the fear of the unknown in relationships. I've never dated before and the thought terrifies me. I put myself down all the time too.

It sounds like you're feeling quite conflicted- that you feel there are definitely some positives to your life but that they're sort of overshadowed by the things you still struggle with ? Like it's hard to enjoy the positives when you feel so shit. I guess it's about weighing up if it's worth it. But I think if things have improved for you recently, there is always a chance that other things will improve too. Yes social interactions will always be difficult to us because of autism but doesn't mean we can't learn and improve social skills. Hopefully you can find someone else new to relationship, or not had them in a while (plenty of people will fall into that category at your age) who would be more understanding and you can work out the pace and boundaries together.

The idea of ctb and escaping everything can feel comforting. Even when things weren't as bad for me, I did find comfort in imagining it even if wasn't actively thinking about it, knowing it was always an option helped .",2596907,,,,,,,
Healing but still want to do it in spite of everything?,2599280,dinosavr,"Jul 17, 2024 at 7:02 AM","I think it's really common, sucks to hear that, I know, but it's how it works. I have a hard time understanding it myself and I'm constantly spinning around - almost attempting but getting disrupted by calling the helpline by myself and repeatedly sabotaging any move I make.
But as long as my psychotherapist is right, it's because your suicidality, especially when you gave it that much attention, is very well known and discovered in every single detail, except for actually doing something. It's paradoxically important and comfortable to you. It feels like everything is right where it's supposed to be.
Healing on the other hand is something that is completely undiscovered. You don't know what to do, you feel lost and helpless. It's like you're trying so hard every single day to achieve any kind of relief and it very often doesn't help. It's even quite logical that it's extremely frustrating for you and for people around who don't seem to ever understand it.
And how much can anyone really commit to healing when they can't see ANY point of it, none at all. It's almost crazy that others expect it from us. But I try to perceive any kind of will to see it and try it, just to be sure that I've done everything I could and for my friends. And I think you should give it a try too. Because after all we can always step back and catch the bus anyway and that's that. Keeping my fingers crossed for you!",,,,,,,,
Not sure when feels like a good time to CBT,2593793,dwtsleepy123,"Jul 12, 2024 at 8:20 AM","Its been a while since Ive been on this website, I was getting better for a few months I think (or maybe that was just me deluding myself). I stopped thinking about cbting because I convinced myself that I wouldnt actually do it because I was too much of a coward to go through with it so why not just spend more time on other aspects of my life. I self-harmed less, though I did relapse a couple of times. I never stopped thinking about death and the meaning of my life so I started reading classical literature and philosophy instead. I genuinely think I was on my road to recovery.

But as always life really just loves to give you hope then when u least expect it, send everything crashing down. Things feel different this time now that I've finally found a possible way to hang myself. I really wish there was alternative method I could use that would be less painful but I've weighed my options and unfortunately this seems like the only even slightly feasible method. It took me a while but I finally figured out the logistics of it. I got one of those ropes meant for aerial exercising which hopefully would be able to hold my full body weight and its design also means its easier for me to suspend myself.

All thats left for me to do is:
1) Pack up my room and my stuff so I dont leave a mess for my family
2) Write some goodbye notes
3) Wait for the right time when theres no one around to finally do it
4) decide if Im gonna go with partial or full hanging

I guess the only regrets I will have when I leave is that Ill be leaving my pets behind but I can only hope that my family will take good care of them in my stead or at least give them to a better home. They've been one of the few things holding me back from leaving and I really tried for them but I think Ive done my best so its time to let go.
I know my family will be affected by this but I hope that with time they will learn to see that having me around would be worse in the long run. As for everyone else I think they will be sad but will get over it quickly, after all I'm not close enough to anyone to warrant their grief and honestly, I'd much rather they not.

Im not sure why im even putting this out here but i guess just needed to get this off my chest and tell someone. Ive kept quiet for so long that it feels good to say something even if its just to vent

"I failed the ""Night night"" method twice, trying again today",2582381,waterworks,"Jul 2, 2024 at 10:07 AM","I don't have a reputable source specifically for this method, because I believe it falls under the same category as certain kinds of hanging. Which means it relies on restriction of blood flow to the brain to achieve death. There are is two ways death can be caused by neck constriction:
Asphyxiation: Tightening the airways to prevent oxygen from reaching the lungs, leading to suffocation.
Cerebral Ischemia: This occurs when there is an inadequate blood supply to the brain, which can lead to brain damage and death.
The ""night night"" method falls under cerebral ischemia, because the airways are usually left open, but pressure is applied to the two carotid arteries (mainly), blocking blood flow to the brain (ischemia). You can refer to this National Library of Medicine's article on Cerebral Ischemia:
This is where the brain damage comes in. There may be no significant risk in testing, if you don't completely cut off supply and are applying just enough pressure to produce an effect. The problem is repeatedly attempting and failing, because in an attempt you are trying to kill yourself. Essentially, you aim is to completely cut off supply. If you achieve this, but during the process, your constricting device shifts and blood flow is restored, eventually returning you to consciousness, the neurological damage will depend on how long your brain was deprived of oxygen.

Feeling very confused tonight,2599162,DuplicateFeline,"Jul 17, 2024 at 2:58 AM","My boyfriend wants to buy me a new a tattoo. I'm not talking about something small, he wants to buy me an entire sleeve, which will cost several thousand dollars. I have found that there are three opinions about this:

1) Take what I can get. He has $30,000 in his checking account, and several hundred in both his savings and retirement fund. This is flawed because I intend to catch the bus in less than two months and even getting a consultation could take that long or longer. Is the tattoo sleeve I've always wanted worth living for? Because I have a date set, and I will not be around to have it finished

2) Someone told me that I should be almost insulted at the idea. I don't have a job, a car, or any significant income. How come he couldn't spend that on keeping me alive? I need groceries! I need to live in somewhere that isn't falling apart at the seams! The place I live in right now has a crazy infestation of gnats, the gutters have fallen off, I spent 10 days in the hospital because my body couldn't tolerate not having a freezer or a stove... But somehow the tattoo sleeve is what he chooses to spend money on??

3) The tattoo should be a reason to stay alive. It is something that I have wanted for years, and the boyfriend is more than happy to provide enough money to make it a reality. So I should take it as a sign that I should keep on going

What are your thoughts? Do you all think that I should stay alive to see the whole tattoo complete, even though it will take so many months and so much money that my boyfriend is happy to provide? Should I refuse because I could use that money to escape my crappy living situation? Should I refuse because I don't intend to live past when we'd have to wait to even get a consultation?

EDIT: I think it might be important to add that we have been dating for 10 years. We aren't married and living together for a multitude of reasons, but it isn't as if my boyfriend of six months is offering this",,,,,,,,

The only thing you can do is refuse the tattoo if you don't agree on him spending money on you like that. It's a dangerous road to expect him to fix your living situation for you.

Of course if he offers, that's a different story. Anyways, CTB is always there. If you decide to get the tattoo, you can always choose to CTB after. It's up to you if you're willing to live that long. But I think if you have doubts, it's better to wait.",,,,,,,,

It may actually be worth sticking around, but I've already postponed my plan for a couple of months and that frustrates me. I want the tattoo very, very badly since I've been thinking about it for so long and would never be able to afford it without his help, but he says it would have to be divided into parts. Linework for my birthday (August 9th) and color for Christmas. I will be around for my birthday, so I could get the linework done, but I won't be around for Christmas if all goes well, and I don't want to CTB with a half-finished tattoo.

2) For me and EVERYONE has their own ideas/opinions on this, but having had 2 attempts, ctb is truly one and done, no do overs, no second thoughts, nothing.

If it is something that you have always wanted, then go over it and do not let the other aspects interfere. Ctb is NOT going anywhere

At 68, I can really say that in the past I wish I would have taken the opportunity when it was availed to, me. Like one time, a VERY beautiful lady wanted to go out with me, and I had cold feet, this was back in the 1970's and never paid her any attention and she moved on, and to this day I still really regret it. Oh, and also her dad was a multi-millionaire and I have always felt that that was one of the reasons for my cold feet as I did not want her spending money on me. Darn I still miss her in 2024.

A tattoo is what you have wanted, you have a very kind. loving and caring partner that can make that dream come true and I say go for it.

If it alters the ctb, well guess what the aspect of ctb is NOT going anywhere and believe me, a wonderous sunset hand in hand with a new tattoo from a loved one is true bliss at its finest.

Enjoy, a new tattoo, a loving embrace from your partner, and enjoy a wonderful sunset or sunrise hand in hand.

Lots of hugs, kind thoughts and the knowledge that you are a caring soul, your partner sees this all the time.

I know that my boyfriend loves me very much, but I'm starting to get frustrated and restless. I have several health conditions that will never get any better and I just want it to be OVER. It doesn't matter how much money my boyfriend throws at them, I still have to take a crazy amount of pills for a 28 year old just to function and a tattoo is not going to fix that, Would a big, beautiful tattoo would be nice? Absolutely. Would it fix anything? No. That's part of why I'm hesitant to accept his offer. It's a bandaid, not a solution
The thing is that I DO want the tattoo badly, but only if I decide to live, which is something that I really do not want to do. I was supposed to CTB on July 5th and now I'm just getting restless. Though the general opinion is that I should at least wait it out until the tattoo is done. This year will be the 21st anniversary of my first thought about catching the bus, so what's a couple more months, I guess. I do wish I could do SOMETHING in the meantime, though. I used to SH when I was in high school to temper the urges to end it but I can't do that as a 28 year old. I don't heal as quickly as I used to and my boyfriend would pick up on the signs very quickly, and then I'd get in trouble",2599195,2599202,,,,,,

No harm in waiting to CTB for a bit (unless you have some unorthodox circumstances). I'd say go through with it if it makes you happy. If push comes to shove, you can still CTB-with a cool tattoo and fewer regrets, to boot

As for the tattoo vs living expenses- kind of depends on one's gift-giving philosophy, I guess.",2599162,,,,,,,
Feeling very confused tonight,2599251,whywere,"Jul 17, 2024 at 5:46 AM","As far as pills goes, we are twins, as I was in a very nasty car crash and I take 15 each and every day and it stinks, but life is always in flux.

I can truly understand the band aide aspect, however, no matter what one's path is going to be, a sidestep and enjoy the moment can be a simple pleasure and it still does not have to cancel future plans.

I, like so many others, have had a rough go of life from getting kicked out by my ""parents"" at 18 with no money nor food or anything and I started out homeless and very hungry. They wanted just 2 kids, 1 boy and 1 girl and I have a older brother and a younger sister. I was NEVER wanted as since I was the 2nd child, I was supposed to be a female and NOT a male child and they would have given me up for adoption, but this was 1956 and that was taboo then.

I have also had 2 attempts, 72 hour holds and a court fight where the state wanted me locked up long term, I won that aspect, thank you GOD for that!

With that said, I love everyone and want the very best for all the folks here and I wish you the very best as to which ever decision(s) you make.

You are family to/for me as I have no family nor friends.

Lots of hugs and a beautiful blue sky to you, you are just so precious.

My introduction,2593685,Badger88,"Jul 12, 2024 at 5:43 AM","Let me introduce myself.


I'm 36 years old and I had been in a relationship for nearly 6 years. We were engaged, had a child together, bought a house, even had the dog. We were planning to marry in June this year, so everything had been booked, dress purchased etc.


One lunchtime, she tells me she's not in love with me anymore, hasn't been for some time. I'm apparently emotionally empty, which may have some truth, but I had been on Citalopram which I think had suppressed any feelings. Needless to say the wedding was cancelled.


We (well I thought ) tried to make amends, I attended therapy and thought something was happening. She kept going over to a 'gay' colleagues house most weeks, I wasn't sure on this and tried to explain to her that it didn't feel right and made me anxious, but she ignored me and told me to grow up. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, she's left me for good, taken everything I ever hold dear.


Today she finally admitted she had been sleeping with this man.


All my hopes and dreams are shattered and I'm just an empty shell of a human being. Tells me I'm selfish for even considering to CTB.


I'm waiting on my last ingredient, SN and I'll be gone.",,,,,,,,

I hate myself so much because of my issues. I try to explain it to the friends I have, but sometimes they don't understand, despite having similar issues. A few months ago, I hosted a d and d game, and I blew up at one of my closest friends in front of his gf and others because of some confusion regarding rules in 5e. Now this alone wouldn't be much of an issue... If 5 other people weren't talking at the same time whole trying to explain it. This happened in March. It's now July. I'm still trying to apologize. I really think I lost him. He's been good to me and my family, and I was good to his. And now because of this, he's gone. Zero contact. I've lost friends before and it did hurt, but this one stung and still stings. I hate myself. I really hope the gun method is as painless and quick as it is theorized. I can't handle myself anymore.

Time from Passing Out to Death with Carotid (and probably Jugular) Blockage,2597614,dolemitedrums,"Jul 15, 2024 at 6:07 PM","So this probably falls under the night night method as I understand it. But anyway, compression of the carotid arteries until unconsciousness and continued compression indefinitely (probably will block the jugulars as well).

No bag over the head, no hanging involved to compress or block other neck vessels.

Should take 10-20 seconds to go unconscious...but from that point how long until actual death where you can't be recovered or revived or continue as a vegetable. For example I have read that hanging also will block breathing and perhaps arteries that feed the brainstem which will be a quicker certain death.

But how long does the situation I described need to be applied for a certain result, for those with superior biological knowledge?",,,,,,,,

Further Observations on the Speed of Death in Hanging

""In reports by Sauvageau and Racette (1), and Yamasaki et al. (2)
the details of filmed suicidal hangings were presented. In the paper
by Sauvageau and Racette the reported victim lost consciousness at
13 sec, began convulsing at 15 sec, and had cessation of respiration
at 2 min. As no report on toxicological analyses was provided, it is
not possible to state whether or not there had been any contribution
to the lethal episode from prescription or illicit drugs (1). In the
second paper the asphyxial process was also rapid, lasting only
2 min 43 sec (2).""

After all I`ve said, mentioning ctb for sure, she just replied that I should go to a psychologist and that I should not bother anyone with my problems. After she started joking on my loss of a father, on my apperiance, and that my mother was abusive to me at some point of my life (she just hit me). After all the jokes I heard she just blocked me.

I am so sorry you had to meet such an emotionally immature person. It's not about you, she just doesn't know how to handle this - probably because she's never had any suicidal ideations in her entire life. If you think about it, it's understandable to be scared from something you don't know. She got scared because suicide is still taboo and something ""we should never talk about"". To her - wanting to die is something that only crazy people whould do.
But it is no excuse for joking about your trauma. It was a really awful thing from her and I am so so sorry it happened to you.
It makes me extremely mad actually that she treated you like this.

But no, no reason to not vent, especially somewhere like here. She probably just didn't know what she was getting into (in addition to being a bit of a bitch) and was expecting a very minor complaint about work or similar, and she had no idea how to handle it. Those heavy subjects are probably best left for people who have braced themselves for such a heavy subject (again, this place is good for that) or people you've been friends with more than a couple of days.

Talking to others about those issues could be very helpful. Please don't let her discourage you from doing so.

Feels horrible that one of the few reasons I'm still around is basically for nothing since I don't do shit for her emotionally, at most I just provide financial support (and that's fucking abysmal cause I work at a fast food place)",,,,,,,,

Just let her know how amazing she looks, unfortunately she sounds like she has poor self image and will find it hard to accept what you're saying. But keep complimenting her and hugging her and she may finally accept herself as someone loveable.
You seem kind & are trying your best for her but you need a bit kinder to yourself too",,,,,,,,
,2579901,Ash,"Jun 30, 2024 at 5:41 AM","Sadly, body dysmorphia can't be healed by kind and supportive words from loved ones, no matter how much we want them to be. Is she getting any kind of support as she transitions or is she going it alone (except for you)?

All I can say is keep being loving and supportive but maybe consider getting professional relationship advice so you can set some boundaries. It's ok for her to question what you've said but not to expect you to have all the answers - that's impossible, even if you were the top psychologist in the world.

Make sure you get time and space for yourself. You're important too and the relationship is supposed to be about both of you. Transitioning is massive and the hormonal adjustments will not be helping things either, so you both need patience, respect for one another and yourselves and maybe some fun? Why did you get together? Can you go back to doing what you did then so it's about the pair of you? Easier said than done, I know. But maybe start small. And we're always here if you need to vent. Don't bottle it up.

,2580025,EvisceratedJester,"Jun 30, 2024 at 7:40 AM","She's likely body dysmorphic and nothing you do will fix that. The problem goes deeper than just needing compliments from others. It's an issue that comes down to her and how she views her own body, not how you or others view her, despite how ot may appear on the surface. Don't beat yourself up over this. You are trying your best to be supportive of her but there isn't much you can do. Body image issues aren't something that can be solved easily through external validation.

You being supportive of her is enough. You don't need to be the one to solve all of her issues.",,,,,,,,
,2580054,Linda,"Jun 30, 2024 at 8:21 AM","Transitioning isn't easy, and it may be taking more out of her than you realise.

A trans woman needs to pay careful attention to a lot of things if she wants to pass: clothes, makeup, hairstyle, jewellry, voice, mannerisms, even way of walking. That's a lot to think about, until she gets used to it, and it would not be surprising if she worries that she's not doing everything as well as she needs to. She will also have had the hassle (and a lot of pain if she used electrolysis) of getting rid of unwanted hair, and if she wants any surgery she can expect a lot more hassle and pain.

Just keep supporting her.

If she wants ""concrete proof""of how she looks, tell her to go to a bar (or somewhere) full of heterosexual men and count how many of them try to chat her up.",2579658,,,,,,,

That way she doesn't feel like every time she commiserates with you she has to be preached to. It's kind of like when we talk to others about suicide. Sometimes we just want to talk without being lectured.

Happiness makes everyone beautiful, I truly believe this. We can't change what we've got but happiness is so attractive. It's probably not something you should say to her. But you can remind her she's beautiful when she laughs, in a mundane moment when you feel in love, etc. Try to tie her beauty outside of her looks.",,,,,,,,

For some it could be, being able to shower once a week, rather than not at all or being able to get out of bed. To go for a walk, when previously that was impossible, or to even open the front door!

As I write this, I realise I have got a little better. I never used to have the energy to shower, or do much really, now I shower daily, and can do my intense workouts again, 3-4 days a week. Some days are harder than others though

It's really about what works for you, and baby steps. No point running before you can walk, and it's always important to pat yourself on the back, no matter what, and to not beat yourself up, because that is not helpful at all.

Tomorrow is ALWAYS a new day! That's how I look at things if say, I have a really crappy day, and can't do much. It's taken a lot to see things this way, after years of beating myself up if I couldn't do something, even something that seems so easy to others - we are all different.

Be proud of yourself for the small things - like wow, I did good today, I haven't done that in so long. And as time goes on, things get easier and easier.

You will have good and bad days, we all do! But it is important to recognise when this happens, and it's absolutely ok to have a bad day. Always, always big yourself up for the things that appear so small",,,,,,,,

Yeah there doesn't seem to be any cases of anyone using it as an ae but a pretty solid guide does state it can be used as one.

"For those planning to use SN, how are you overcoming any fear?",2586604,rj3542,"Jul 5, 2024 at 7:29 PM","Hi everyone, this is my intro post and the first time I've been able to talk about these things, which is such a relief. I tried talking about it to a friend once before, but he kept trying to make everything positive and tell me to vision what I wanted to make it a reality, but that's just not been my life.

I've been reading a lot on here since January and finally made an account.

I have chronic illnesses (Lyme and complications) and major chronic pain from fracturing my spine in a horse accident as a kid that makes it hard to work. It also gave me a bad head injury that caused lifelong neurotransmitter issues. All to say, life has been tough, but I preserved for a long time and spent a lot of time and money on everything possible to improve my quality of life. It takes hours a day of self care just to be able to work or travel, but I did it for many years, and I'm just totally worn out from it all. I've tried numerous meds, supplements, therapies, including several procedures on my spine to get better. This journey consumed my life, but I still pushed forward and found things to enjoy.

I'm not much of a complainer, but my husband never had patience for my health problems and finally got completely tired of me last year. He didn't want to help anymore, and honestly I'm not sure he ever really loves me.

My family doesn't live close, but also has never been supportive and sometimes even denied I had problems even when showed xrays and MRI of injuries, so I'm mostly on my own with a little help from the few friends I have, but they have their own lives of course and are busy. I feel really guilty for how my friends and family will feel, and I've been working through this.

I'm at a point where I'm just weary emotionally and physically every day and am ready to let go. I'm in midlife, and I've done as much as I want. I'm ready to let go of the suffering and struggle. I've been contemplating having choice about an exit for 15+ years, and have been seeking a solid method for 6 months. I found the PHP, final exit, and this website, which I'm so grateful for. I've had plenty of time to consider it so I know it's a rational choice and not a fleeting thought.

I ready tried and had trouble with Nitrogen method, which caused me very rapid heartbeat, severe anxiety, and weird muscle movements without passing out, even with following the method. This seems to be an unusual effect.

So now I've been reading as much about SN as I can since I've finally sourced everything, but still need to test the SN when it arrives. I've been reading all the successful and failed attempt accounts. For some it seems peaceful and for others very painful, even with AE and propranolol, and I only see the 1 observer account of Moonicide of what happened after loss of consciousness. These accounts are so helpful btw.

I'm most concerned about it becoming too painful, but I've already experienced inpatient psych and never want that again, so calling EMS if it's too much is out of the question.

I do have some Ativan I can add, I should have meto and propranolol, and I have risperidone. I have oxycodone or tramadol I could use, if I can figure out the timing.

I didn't mean for this to get so long.

I'm wondering, for those of you who are planning your CTB, how are you working through any fears of pain or failure? How do you muster the courage to take the SN? I'm trying to think of what my future holds if I don't, which helps, but I'm still concerned.

Thanks so much for reading and any responses or thoughts.",,,,,,,,

I've had it really badly before from a near fatal thyroid storm & also from a bad reaction to a (prescribed) ADHD drug. And that heart racing feeling makes my brain go into anxiety mode at a time when I need to be calm. I'm going to book a hotel or caravan park, write a note on the outside of an internal locked door, probably attempt to barricade myself in there depending on what they have - I haven't picked a place yet. But I'm legit thinking about moving couches or whatever to barricade the exit & then do the same in the room I attempt to CTB. I will one hundred percent destroy my phone & the hotel phone once I'm situated. I'm hoping that not having a phone will be super helpful & that if I have taken the SN, I'll be too weak to overcome 2 barricaded exits. And that if it's rural, even if I scream for help, maybe no one will hear me. My 2 big issues, that if anyone has any clue at all, please let me know - 1 is that I'm allergic to propranolol & have no idea what else would stop the tachycardia & no idea if I would be allergic to other beta blockers - I only tried the one. Literally anything to stop the tachycardia, it's really what I'm worried about making me stay awake or panic or something???? And the second is about Valium & temazepam. I have access to a decent amount of both, but I've taken 2 temazepam & 1 diazepam daily for years - does that mean I need more than other people?? Will that help me be calm? Will too much make me vomit? What's too much? I'm a 53 kilo female. I would honestly like to suck them down like lollies - some before the first SN dose but I don't know how many??? And more after my backup dose??? I really don't know & need help with this part of it - how to prevent tachycardia & the maximum amount of temazepam & diazepam I can take & at each stage???!",,,,,,,,

A thyroid storm is definitely terrifying. What happened when you took propranolol?
I have heard if you take benzos regularly you build a tolerance so may need more.
My plan is to crush the benzos in a little water to make a paste and dissolve in my mouth to bypass my stomach and increase onset.

I posted in a other thread about OD on benzos and the response might be helpful.

I'm not sure about the tachyca6 though. It seems very anxiety provoking for you, understandably. Do you feel another method may be better because of this or is your heart set on SN?",,,,,,,,

I had a weird reaction to the beta blocker - I have a history of (I've maybe forgotten the real words, there's about 3 or so) idiosyncratic reactions etc. Either meds do the opposite to me of what they're for or I get highly unusual side effects that aren't listed anywhere but when I stop the meds, the side effects go away - it's a pain. Highly unlikely for anyone else to get the same side effects & especially if not taking for long in advance. It is freaking me out that I'll have an adverse reaction to SN - that my body just accepts it or I start vomiting immediately or I pass out too quick for the second dose etc. It's such an unknown.
My endocrine system is unique & busted up apparently.
The thyroid storm was insane but I wish now I'd taken that opportunity & just died then.
I would imagine I have a high tolerance for a lot of prescription meds that I've been taking long term & that stresses me out too. I'm going to crush the pills too. I am really worried I'll confuse tachycardia for wanting to live & panic making me get help. My decision is made. It won't be unmade. I know for some people the decision is reversible & for some it's not. I'm doing this. I'm just scared of failure. And that my SN isn't legit or whatever. I only have one shot at this. I know other people say that's not true but I have a tonne of life circumstances that are fucked up - if I don't successfully CTB, I honestly don't know how to keep on living. My past is horrid, my present is untenable, but the future - I can't even begin to think of it. So I don't have a plan B to CTB. And I don't have a plan B to SN. I wish I had a backup source but I don't. And I'm too scared to test too far in advance. I really don't know of another option - I hadn't heard of SN until I joined here - I had stupidly thought I could just OD on what I had on hand & only came here to find lethal quantities & that's when I found out how stupid I really am. I need to go. And soon. And I wanna get it right. I can't do guns or hanging & I'm not confident I'd get charcoal or gas right & I can't jump & I wouldn't jump in front of a train driver & I just don't know what else I could do that is idiot proof. I need idiot proof..,
I'm definitely turning off anything location related before I leave my house. Getting situated at the hotel. If I haven't tested the SN, test the SN.
Destroying the hotel phone immediately.
Have a literal checklist of what to do & do most of it, like making up the SN, taking some anxiety meds.
Then have a note to destroy phone.
And a separate list of what to do after.
So that I don't destroy before I make up the SN etc or if I need to look on here for a regimen tip or anything last minute.
But don't have after taking the SN & hoping I can just get through it. According to ER doctors, I have an unusually high pain threshold but I also make an exceptional amount of noise - they'll be pumping morphine into my stomach saying they didn't know why I hadn't gone to doctor or hospital earlier & I just shrug it off - but I make a racket, just like I do at the gym - I don't want to but I'm always the loudest groaner & grunter there too. It's embarrassing in those circumstances but really fucking terrifying in these CTB & SN circumstances. Anxiety is a bitch & tachycardia mimics it & I've suffered both & it's very easy to confuse one for the other. I'm hoping I can get the right amount of anxiety meds into me without vomiting & that it's all smooth sailing. I see a lot in the unsuccessful cases that it's about being found too quickly or panicking & calling for help, rather than actually mucking up the SN….",2588774,2588882,,,,,,

I'm dealing with uncertainties too and it's also not an option for me to fail because of life circumstances. I can't take care of myself independently very well anymore and the alternatives are awful.

The closer I get to my ctb date the more I'm starting to freak out about whether I'll succeed. I do have nitrogen setup, but I had an unusual experience where I didn't pass out even with oxygen down to 55%. I've only passed out once and it was from a bad head injury. I'm worried I won't go unconscious for a long time or that I'll also have paradoxical reactions to the meds.

With the noise you make, may I suggest an airbnb instead of hotel? There have been more than a few reports of people being rescued too early in hotels because other guests heard the noises and someone called paramedics.

I live with my parents, and they do feel somewhat of a desire to care for me. My little brother is autistic, so I doubt he'd understand the concept of grief, which isn't really his fault at all.

I have a best friend, and we're still in regular contact. I could text her right now even because I know she's still up. She works at a restaurant on the weekends and her boyfriend is a pissbaby but I'll tolerate him to keep her happy.

I might be getting back with my ex girlfriend. We have a date planned for this Saturday. We're going to the aquarium because I felt jealous of some classmates who went without me back in June. She's really pretty but she's kind of awkward on phone calls.

We're in the digital age, and I'm a ""photogenic white girl"". I'm only 18, still a child in the eyes of some. It would be considered a tragedy instead of an inevitability. People would bring casseroles to my mother and my brother would forever be known as ""the kid whose sister killed herself"".

I read on here all the time about people who experienced homelessness. Who are estranged from their family. Going through marital problems. Those without the resources to receive proper help and even if they did, they lack a support system to help them follow through with their better habits, so they worry (or know) that they'll just fall back into the darkness.

People would cry at my hospital bed and I would tell them to leave.

Mounds and mounds of self hatred engulf me because I would actually rather die before I have an open and honest conversation with my mother about my 'feelings' or whatever. Or my father, grandmother, aunts, uncles, cousins and all those in between.

There are people whose parents aren't around anymore, or who can't contact them for fear of their own safety. And here I am being a little bitch about talking to mine.

People would kill for the life I have and I want to die living in mine.

I can objectively say that I have admirable traits. I think everyone does, even if you can't see them. Even if the bad outweighs the good. I can list things I admire about people whom I never wish to speak to again. People call me pretty and I don't think they're lying. People call me smart, funny, talented, thoughtful, kind, any and all of the above. Jack off to my instagram, why dontcha? Who fucking cared if I was 18 or 8 in those pictures?

I have everything I've ever wanted and I'm miserable!


I don't see myself as a virtuous person, I view myself as someone who just has some decency. A good person could never be anything like me and I can never figure out why.

The bar for being good is set so low these days that anyone who isn't an outright criminal might as well be nominated for sainthood.

I'm bad because I'm fucked in the head and I always have been. I'm bad because I'm a self entitled bitch. I'm bad because most religions fucking despise me. I'm bad because of things I can and cannot control.

I'm bad because a good person wouldn't keep staying in these bad situations when the way out is so goddamn simple.

I have a support system that I will not seek support from. I've never seen an adult psychologist and why even bother trying? The child ones were sucky enough to turn me off for life.

Am I gone too soon or did I remain too long? Can you prevent a chosen fate? Can a remedy be a tragedy if you don't believe that the end justifies the means?

And to what end?",,,,,,,,

Borderline and Updates,2580524,SilverTiger,"Jun 30, 2024 at 3:27 PM","Hello SaSu.

It has been one month since I have even looked at this site, this month has been exceptionally hard, I've got borderline personality disorder and each of the four weeks of this month I have had multiple episodes... I'm male and 26 for context.

I met someone on 4chan, talking about firearms and added him on discord at the start of the month, I have done quite odd sexual things with him, multiple times this month I have went on calls / text with him and ended up crying and screaming and begging for him to save me from myself. He had an ex with BPD so knows how to deal with me, but he has become my favourite person. I mean this when I say it, I truly believe it, I think he is god's gift to me, I basically made him my boyfriend, but I am paranoid he is going to abandon me, even though I now know where he lives, what he looks like and what his full name is. I still feel like he is going to walk away from

I go on alt-chans a lot, and I ended up meeting multiple older men there, where very interested in my self harm, I needed someone to talk to as I felt empty and in my infinite wisdom, I started to cut my wrists, so these older men could use me for sexual gratification, I begged and pleaded for them to stay with me and not toabandon me, as there was warm blood down my arms. I cut quite badly and ended up bleeding all over my shirts and desk so these men wouldn't leave me, but all three ended up ignoring me after finishing.

I went out with my Ph.D. supervisor, (no fault to him, hes a fantastic man) and he kept getting me ciders as I never had one before and it tasted fucking amazing, I kept drinking and drinking and drinking, and he saw my fresh self harm scars, and like a fucking idiot I told him I use to sexually roleplay with when I was 13 with older men over Skype / Omegle and now I am paranoid that he is going to ""care"" and report me for self harm and me being abused as a child, I don't care either of these happened I just didn't want anyone to know.

I was a fucking idiot and also told two friends I had, that I was assaulted as a child, I never wanted this to be found out by my friends, but these two people now know that I am fucked behind repair because of what my family did to me.

I fucked up really badly this month, and have paid the price for it in blood, new scars and letting people know more about me then I ever wanted them to.

Borderline is a person, someone who has known me since I was a child and someone who has his hands around my throat and is squeezing as hard as he can, I am not strong enough to fight him off.

The two people I told about what happened as a child, are now forcing me to go to therapy and get mood stabilizers, but I don't want this, I don't want to be the play thing of some strange psychiatrist woman or man.

4chan has a word for people like me ""BPDemons"" in reference to the damage we cause to others.

This has reinforced my will to die, not just for my sake, friends sake",,,,,,,,

Just my two cents, but that's what I feel. I want to shoot myself but don't have access to a gun. I want to hang myself but can't get a partial to work and don't have an anchor point that's high enough for a full suspension.

This is why sites like this exist, why methods for self-destruction are searched for, why ropes are bought for 'special' purposes, why some form a morbid attachment to knives, why the view from the front of a high-speed train becomes enticing, why human anatomy becomes a subject of grim fascination, and why various substances seem appealing for consumption.

Sure the bag may stuck in front of the mouth depriving you from oxygen that way, but I wouldn't count on it.

At the recommended flow rate (15/lpm) 225 liters of inert gas is the minimum amount of gas. But because of practice runs or other unforeseen weak points is recommended to at least double the gas to around 400 liters. I would personally say 1000 liters to be sure, the amount only becomes unnecessary large over 3000l maybe.

All inert gases are compressed to around 100-200 times of atmospheric pressure. The cylinder may start at 7 liters but compressed 200 times it equals to 1400 liters approximately.

The pph advice using an inert gas of at least 97% purity and others on the forum would argue at least 99.7% purity.

Hi outrider567,
The increase in heart rate was not noticeable to you, then? I'm hypersensitive, so easily pick up on changes to my body which then causes a hypersympathetic/adrenaline response in me. Do you feel comfortable going forward at this point?
Hi rj3542
I've heard exit guides say that the individual is usually unconscious after just a few breaths and about 10-15 sec. (and without 02 sat. staying as low as you state for very long) so I'm surprised you lasted that long. Your adrenal response must be very strong and your body must strongly want to keep itself going.
What do you think the jerky arm movements is about? I haven't heard of this as a problem before, except some anecdotes of it happening once a person is unconscious.",2548291,2590748,2591003,2591837,,,,
"Thankfully, The Time Has FINALLY Come...",798025,AgentAlaniKelso,"Jul 24, 2020 at 5:36 AM","Hi all.
I have the sense that this weekend will be when I ctb. Between my terrible marriage, my family who could give a fuck less about anyone other than themselves, and work related issues, it is clear to me that by continuing to fight and persevere, I'm actually doing more harm than good.

The kicker for me is my husband is so mean and abusive to my sweet little dog that I just can't anymore... I begged my sister to take him, until I can at least find him a new home, but of course, now that it's ME who needs something from her, it's a no go. I'll be taking my sweet little baby to the local animal shelter tomorrow. He's a purebred, actually really pretty, and barely a year old so it won't take long to get him anywhere better than here. That said, we have a bunch of animals- three dogs, two cats, a parrot, some ducks and chickens, and a variety of salt and fresh water aquariums. My husband says they are all ""his"" animals and never ""ours"". BUT this little pup is MY animal- the one animal that my husband refers to as ""YOUR stupid fucking dog."" This pup has been keeping me going for the last several months. But with the most recent episode of abuse by my husband, it's time for my little guy to go elsewhere. And it is tearing my heart in half to have to do this. But it's best for him. This sweet little dog doesn't deserve to be kicked, slapped, punched, or choked. I told my husband ""no fucking more"" and guess how that went over with the self-described ""animal lover."" Protecting my dog has kept me going. And now I need to let him go to save him or my husband WILL kill him.

Why not leave my husband? Yeah- the only way that's happening is in a body bag by his hand. He will shoot me if I told him I was leaving. And there is sure as fuck no way I'm checking out by the hand of some piece of shit narcissistic psychopath.

I've always struggled with depression. I have what I call an inherent death wish, meaning that, even from my early childhood, I've always wanted to be dead. Hell, my very first thought about killing myself was at six years old. And I actually tried at eight to suffocate myself under a blanket (didn't work for obvious reasons). Didn't have a bad childhood, had loving parents, and didn't have any major traumas. I've just always wanted to be dead. I always thought there was no way I'd make it to 15, then 18, then 20, then 25, then 30.... and then things got ok. But over the last two years, my ""spirit"" has been crushed out of me and looks like I won't be making it to 37... Hate to say I'm disappointed but I'm not. This is just the progression and inevitable conclusion of my life.

Honestly, more than anything else, the thing that I'm most dreading is that I'll miss out on Cyberpunk 2077... How fucking pathetic is that?! That was literally the only thing I was looking forward to in the coming months...

Two last things:
First, I'm a reasonably intelligent person. I've been a nurse for over a decade and have extensive ICU experience as well as leadership and admin. I could never wrap my head around my depression. But a couple of weeks ago it finally clicked in my brain- some people are not meant to be loved and not meant to have any value. And I am one of those people. I was lucky to have been loved by my parents. I have no real value as a human- I don't deserve love, I don't deserve to be hugged, I don't deserve to occupy the space that I do. My life and my passing will be of no real consequence to anyone- how exactly do you assign emotions to something of zero value? By CTBing, I'll be blinking myself out of existence. As for afterlife, well, I worked in ICU long enough and been around enough death to have come to the belief that when you die, youre just dead. No spirit, no afterlife, no divine presence- you just cease to Be. And I am 100% good with that. Seems way fucking more desirable than ""oh yay, an eternal afterlife.... yippee."" Fuck. That. I did my time, performed my duties, and saved some lives. All I want in return is this one thing.

Second, the deed- lots of remote areas around where I live. I ride a dirt bike and have scouted out some primo places in preparation for the bus. Leaving my cellphone/Apple Watch thingy at home. Bringing my shotgun. Going about 20 miles into the single track mountain trails and making my own path for the last mile or so. So as remote as I can be without raising suspicion at home. Hopefully will not be able to be tracked down by cell data, etc. Finding some cover for the bike and myself. Weighed my options- meds, suicide by motorcycle, firearms. Have a 6.5 Creedmoor rifle but the logistics seem burdensome and my arms aren't six feet long. Have some 9mm/10mm pistols but ICU nurse me has seen enough times where that shit doesn't always work as planned. Therefore, 12g shotgun birdshit vs 00 with a transoral anterior/posterior approach seems like a pretty sure bet. (I've always loved Kurt Cobain). Also considering behind the ear, like mastoid-to-mastoid. Either way, I don't think it will matter and results will be had relatively quickly. Been practicing with placement and angles. I know the anatomy so shouldn't be a problem. I don't want to be found, hence leaving the phone/watch at home and being so remote. Going for a whole sky burial approach- I know I'll get eaten by the wildlife and I'm actually pretty ok with that- at least I will be of value to our furry friends. A nice meal makes everyone feel better! Hoping it will be at least a few days before whatever is left of me is recovered.

Sorry for the excessively long post- but thanks to our wonderful society, the only place I feel I can safely talk about this stuff without being losing my career/house/guns is here. I just have to get this stuff out somewhere- anywhere. I just want someone to listen. To fucking care. To have someone, anyone say ""I understand and I won't stop you."" I have been suffering with these feelings for over 30 years and I just can't do this shit any more.",,,,,,,,

To those who have asked- yes I've tried many things over the years to ""fix"" myself. Meds, therapy, meditation, physical activity, retreats, etc., etc. Never done any inpatient stints or anything like ECT, but i'm not wiling to do that, not at this point. I started with therapy intensely at 15 years old and it did me a lot of good and I will say it saved my life.

Yes, my husband is a piece of shit. Yes, he's an animal abuser and my little pup has a target on his back at all times. Husband has never laid a hand on me fortunately. He has made it clear that if I did try to leave, the first call would be to the nursing board and the second call would be to my employer. He's not stupid and he knows what to say to ensure that I would be immediately suspended pending investigation based on his ""allegations."" And he would just never stop. I contacted a lawyer for divorce a while back and relayed this to him and he didn't really have an answer that was helpful... I even went so far as to ask about some kind of witness protection-esque deal where I can just start over with a new name and new identity. Apparently that is NOT a thing that us common folk can legitimately do.

My decision to CTB is my final form of protest in regards to how fucked this world is, how fucked my family is, and how much I hate my husband. Just checked my life insurance today. He wont get any of the $600k accidental death/dismemberment benefit since self-inflicted stuff isn't covered. But he will get all of the general life insurance, well in excess of $400k. I called to see if I could change my beneficiary but since he is listed as primary, they would only let me change it with is consent/signature. I know he'll be happy with that money and he can continue his path of severe alcoholism and continue to slowly snuff himself out.

I either stay and suffer, leave and lose my 16 year career as a nurse, or I stand up for myself and end this fucking nonsense once and for all. There is no other way out. He wont stop, he cant stop. It's his nature, it's who he is. As I said earlier, he is the very definition of a narcissistic psychopath. Not sociopath, but a legit psychopath.

I really do appreciate the responses. You don't know me well enough to see that I am nothing. My very existence is like a black hole. I'm just taking up space at this point. I worried people would miss me and my actions will hurt others. But no, how do you mourn something that doesn't deserve even a second glance? My mother, god rest her, is gone. I don't even exist to my father. My sister only calls when she needs something and NEVER has time for me otherwise. My brother, well... I think he will be effected but I also know he understands these feelings. There is no one else. I'm a prisoner to my own emptiness, to my own suffering. The world deserves someone who will do good and someone who is worthy of love. I am nothing. Ironically, it was the meditation that made me realize all this and led me to be at peace with my decision. Realizing I am nothing has been a gift in a way.

Sunday is the day. Will update if I fail to follow through. But my mind is made up and my pup has a new home to go to later this afternoon. I have nothing left. I am nothing.",,,,,,,,

I am so very sorry for all that you have had to go through! I so very much wish you hadn't have had to suffer in the ways you have*.

Even though our circumstances are very different, a lot of what you said resonated with me very deeply. You are a very intelligent person. And even though the causes & conditions may be different... I think I very much understand your feelings (through my direct experience).

May I please offer you a Buddhist prayer of lovingkindness both for right now -- for this very moment and what you're having to go through (with your pup, your husband, the preparations, etc.) -- and, if you must, for whatever may come... including your going (Sunday, or whenever that may be) and beyond (if anything)**?

Also, since you've mentioned meditation, retreats, etc. (btw, I very much envy your ""sky burial approach"")... if you decide to ctb, please try to use your skills to leave with as clear and ""empty"" a mind as you can: The animals, feelings of ""deserving"" or ""not deserving"", your family, the life insurance, any and all aspects of your malevolent husband, etc., etc. ---- will all work-out in the end. If you decide to go... go without regret... go with clarity... go ""completely"".

So now, if you kindly permit it, I wholeheartedly offer you this and will be repeating it in your name many times in the next several days...

May you be free of suffering, @AgentAlaniKelso & your ""sweet little doggie"".
May you have mental happiness, @AgentAlaniKelso & your ""sweet little doggie"".
May you have physical happiness, @AgentAlaniKelso & your ""sweet little doggie"".

I too am almost ready/""there"" and hope to ctb within the next week. I 100% support you in whatever you decide. Yet, I wonder if you could somehow escape the abusive relationship, if you weren't ""trapped"", would that be enough to change things? I'm just wondering if you went to the president of the Nursing Board & your employer & other community resources that may be easier to find through hospital personnel -- FIRST (strategically preempting anything your husband might later claim) -- and told them straight up about the situation & what your husband was capable of -- if there weren't a way out...?

I don't remember the exact date, but this is what happened when I decided to CTB. I remember every detail, every minute of that day like it just happened. Maybe because it was supposed to be the end. Maybe it was so I would never forget how close I came.

It was later in July of 2020 when I left my phone and smart watch at home. I put on my dirt bike gear, grabbed my 9mm and a moleskin notebook, and climbed on my motorcycle. I remember leaving the house and looking back at ""home"" and was overwhelmed with both sorrow and happiness. Sorrow because I can't believe it came to this. Happiness and... peace... because it was finally going to be over. The trek up the mountain was about 20 minutes (our town is right at the foot of the mountain) until the pavement ends. Another 45 minutes and I was deep into the back roads into single track territory. I remember the sun being so hot with my motorcycle gear. It was a hard ride - riding in back country single track is tough work. I cried the entire time, started as soon as I looked back at home for presumably the last time, and that made the ride more difficult.

I was far off any main or even secondary road. I remember stopping my bike at some random spot on the trail. I killed the engine and took off my goggles and helmet. I walked my dirt bike off the trail to the left about 100 yards into some kind of thicket (juniper? sage?). I set my bike on the kickstand and sat down in the center area of this small group of shrubs. I took my moleskin and my pistol out of my riding back. I had one round in the magaize- it was a 125gr jacketed hollow point 9mm. I pushed the clip in, chambered the round, and set the pistol down next to me.

It was a beautiful day. Hot, but beautiful. A nice breeze. No clouds. At that altitude (8000 ft), everything is always a little cooler, even when the blazing summer sun is directly overhead. I open my moleskin and started writing names. My sister. My grandmother. My brother. My boss. The two coworkers I was close with. A couple of other names I don't recall now. Maybe my husband's name? I sat and stared at the page, still crying, still tired, still done. I wanted to write a note for each person but realized it wouldn't matter in the end. I leaned back and laid down, staring up at the pine trees and the sky, tears still streaming out of my eyes. I blankly stared for what seemed like an hour. It was nice - I found myself meditative state where I had no thoughts popping up anymore, just calmly staring into nothing with no thoughts, no hurt, no sorrow, no happiness. I rarely can get to that point when I meditate, so it was an unexpected gift.

I must have dozed off and I startled awake. I don't know what it was - maybe a hypnagogic twitch, maybe a noise, I had no idea. But I was very awake. I remembered - I came here to close out the story of my life on my terms. My bike was cooled down by then and I laid it on its left side and moved it under the cover of the shrubs. My pistol was loaded, and I was ready to roll. I picked up the gun, checked the chamber - ready. I moved next to my bike under the overhang of some branches. With my right hand, I placed the muzzle behind my right ear, maybe an inch behind my ear canal. Midbrain and brain stem. Instant. No sense of pain. No real chance at screwing it up, especially with hollow points. No chance at being found in time for a rescue. It would be over faster than my brain would register. And with the placement, that pretty much ensured my brain would not have the functional capacity to register. Instant knockout, instantly end the respiratory drive. Heart would beat for a bit. My brain would die obviously from the bullet and my heart would die from blood loss and eventually a massive heart attack. I knew what I was doing and I was ready. My final gift to myself and to no one but me.

My finger in the trigger guard. Then my finger on the trigger. Slight pressure. And I sat. And sat. And sat... And I couldn't do it... I don't know why. No divine intervention. No ""I felt a presence."" Survival ""instinct"" maybe? Hoping that maybe, by finally walking right up the the line and taking such an extreme measure and backing down, things would finally change? Embarassment? Honestly, in retrospect, I was taken aback that it had all come to THIS. That I was there, planning on doing THAT. I was so ashamed. Scared and ashamed. I wanted anyone in that moment. Anyone to find me - to see what I was doing and to just hold my hand and tell me, ""No. Not today. Not like this. I am here and I'm going to help you."" Of course, by my own design, no one came and no one was there.

I set my bike back upright. I unchambered the round and put the pistol back in my pack. I ripped the page of names out of my moleskin. I folded it twice and set the page on the ground by the shrubs. I found a rock large enough to cover the entire folded page. Maybe some kind of grim ""message in a bottle."" I gathered the rest of my things and put my helmet on. I started my bike and set off.

I made it home about an hour later and husband met me out on the driveway. I had been gone for almost four hours. I knew I was in trouble and I was expecting his normal reaction - anger and hostility. I turned off the engine, lowered the kickstand, and swung myself off the bike. With this odd look of concern (I remember it so vididly - concern is not on the approved emotion list for him), husband said, ""Where were you."" I lied, ""I got turned around on the mountain and had to double back a few times."" He followed, ""You left your phone and watch. I was worried. I'm glad you made it back ok."" I paused and said, ""Me too."" I still don't know if I meant it or not when I realized what came out of my mouth. And that was it.

Fast foward to now. I wish things were different. I wish I was different. It was helpful to share what happened that day. Something I can never tell anyone in my ""real life."" Thank you, American health care system, for making people who own firearms and work in the same health care system afraid to tell their story and be heard due to the fear of losing your freedom and livelihood. Since that day, a lot has changed and more has stayed the same. I continue to look for any excuse, any reason to keep on trying, to keep on going, to not give up. But three and a half years on, I find myself in the same position again and I'm quickly running out of excuses. Maybe I'll share more. I don't want to die, but I can't live like this anymore. I don't want to die, and it helps to share.",,,,,,,,

He's been gone from us for several years now unfortunately. But I was pleasantly surprised to see it is you. I rarely post but I want to apologize for not responding to you before. I must've been watching this thread because I was impressed with your writing and your grasp and depth of understanding of your own situation. You're obviously very intelligent and sensitive as well but very capable too. Well, I for one am glad you're still on this shitty , surreal planet. You certainly do more good than I ever could from the sound of it. With so many awful people in the world we need honest and caring people to try and keep a balance of some sort even though bad is probably going to win at some point. So don't feel badly about changing your mind to ctb if you do. Think of it as a trial run to get better oriented with the whole dynamics of the process. Feelings will always arise that you didn't expect when making a big change. Feel free to DM me if you ever need or want to. I hope your situation has improved and you're having a good day",,,,,,,,

Constant feeling of worthlessness,2598969,A Tortured Entity,"Jul 16, 2024 at 10:13 PM","Hi, I'm recently turned 18 a month ago, from Europe. I'm just venting because I can't shake off any of these persistent thoughts of worthlessness.

Some backstory; I've been depressed since I was 14/15 and its only got worse with time. Started antidepressants and therapy at 16 and nothing has changed nor helped. I've stopped taking antidepressants by my own decision because I didn't notice a change and I hated the idea of having some sort of pill alter the way your brain works. Self harm here and there but nothing besides light scarring on arm that barely breaks epidermis, which constantly makes me feel shit and an insult to those that have done significant harm to themselves. Used to have passive suicidal ideations but they have worsened a lot to constantly provoking me daily and thinking about the gorey outcome of it all.

I don't really know where to start but I guess with stuff making me depressed and suicidal. I hate how I look and it has always destroyed any confidence I have in myself. I am not as unfortunate as others in the genetic lottery but I don't feel comfortable at all in my body. Any time I see a reflection of myself it always fuels me with anger because of how much I hate myself and that I'll never find a partner in life. And before anyone says that someone will like you for personality, that doesn't mean anything I look ugly. Also my well below average sheathed sword only makes me feel even worse about ever finding a girlfriend, so that helps a lot. I don't think I'll ever experience love so that's something I need to accept sooner or later.

I failed pretty much all my end of year school exams a month ago, so I have no hope of going to college without wasting a year of my life preparing again for the same stressful exams that is also a large part to blame in my deteriorating mental health. I had some hope in the weeks before exams by studying here and there but it was all just delusion because it is impossible to study a year and a half worth of material in less than a month. I missed probably a year and a half of school since starting therapy and antidepressants just because I was feeling so horribly low everyday. Exams roll around and first one goes horrible and I run out of time because of my non-existent time management and all hope is lost. I end up not sitting half of the exams and any exams I did sit I only ended up feeling even worse about because of how stupid I was for thinking I ever had a chance of getting into college. College is guaranteed out of the picture for me now and I am 100% certain I would not of even done well enough to meet the criteria of any courses I applied for (I applied for music production courses if anyone wanted to know). There is no possible surprise of getting accepted into a college because I know how poorly I did and I didn't even sit half of my exams out of pure anxiety and a horrible depressive episode. 6 years of school to just fall flat on my face and look like a dummy.

I have a very big interest in music and have wanted to make music since I was 14 and I haven't even made anything finished or completed since. Any time I did try to compose something, I would feel completely horrible about it and doubt my abilities to do anything just mere minutes afterwards. I would learn and learn but any time I tried to put my knowledge to use, it would just turn on me and make me feel worse. I have an issue of trying to perfect everything so I guess that is to blame, but I don't understand why I can't make something I don't hate. Regardless if its just the beginning of an musical idea I'm putting down, I just get this overwhelming feeling that I can't do anything good and that I'm horrible at music and I'll never get good at it and it traumatised me enough that I don't ever go near making music ever unless I get a random spark of motivation and decide to mess around spontaeneously with music, which always ends the same. How can something I love so much just not let me do it anymore? It's same with other things in life, like playing the piano, I get so angry at myself for making mistakes even though I only started piano half a year ago, I can't do anything about this perfectionist mindset and it's ruining everything. I love music so much and I always listen to it and love exploring new genres and going back and relistening to tracks that give me goosebumps from emotions intertwined with the music, but I can't start anything. There's also a problem with jealousy that lies there because when I do sometimes listen to music or see others drawings or art, I become envious of artists and their ability to make something so great because I can't do anything, but it doesn't make me go and hate the artist, it's just mental gymnastics I guess.

I don't do anything with my life either. I just sit in my room all day, barely eating and using my computer or sleeping as a form of escapism. I don't live in a nice area so there's nowhere quiet to be in nature which sucks, just constant vehicle noise and the sight of grey and bricks everywhere, quite awfully depressing the lack of green anywhere. I'm not mentally capable of a job either and I don't want to work for 45 years just for a pension. That's so fucking depressing to think about it just ruined my mood while writing this. I want to be able to do whatever and not be a slave for the rest of my life just to barely survive from paycheck to paycheck.By no time the whole world population will be depressed and given pills to survive. By no time the whole world population will be depressed and given pills to survive. I hate how the world has become.

I'd love to be able to appreciate the little things in life and take in nature but I can't where I live while also being in this depressive headspace, and being lazy/depressed to go anywhere doesn't help. I know for a fact I have an okay life, besides the mental health difficulties, that some people would call me ungrateful for not being happy and thankful for what I have, but in reality I can't see things the same way other people do while plagued with depression.

That's kinda it I guess, I don't remember if I'm missing anything, I just feel so utterly worthless everyday and I don't know what to live for anymore. I feel like my life is over.",,,,,,,,

I hate this and dislike even trying. My counselors offer on the solace of ""and why do you think that is"" or ""failure is really just how you define it, haven't we talked about how to visualize …"".

The last straw,2598949,ReadyToGo34,"Jul 16, 2024 at 9:49 PM","A few days ago, I didn't think I wanted to tell anybody of my plans. But against my better judgement, I did. My mom goes live on social media a lot now because she has serious health complications and has sought it out as a way of making friends. And she has. She typically goes on very early mornings, and I used to work nights (recently unemployed) so I would hop on at times when I couldn't sleep. I saw she was live a few days ago, maybe a week, not sure, all my days are a blur now, but I commented with my usual ""hey mommy!"". One thing I wanna say before I continue is, she doesn't deserve the attention I give her. I suspect she is a narcissist and from the age of 1 I was raised by my grandparents. She abandoned me, and did her ""best"" to be in my life a few years later and beyond, but she's just...not a mom. I've viewed her as like the cool bigger sister for a long time. She's not fit. But I digress. I say my usual greeting, everybody else says hi, and I stay for awhile to chat. Meanwhile, I contact her via a different app to impulsively tell her hey look, I want to DIE. Like...I can't go on anymore. I hurt, momma. Told her how I had a plan. She didn't see the notification at first, since she is busy on live. I write in the chat, hey check your other app, I wrote you something. She did and wrote back I'll call you when I'm done. I'm like...okay...so she'll just wrap it up and be done. Nope. She just stayed on live. Like..laughing and talking and livin it up. This goes on for over another hour. I hit her up again like ????? I'm in crisis, I need you, and her response was to tell me what a ""huge dump"" that was on her. I......I understand it's heavy news, but get off with your little friends and talk to me. I need my mother. Argument insues, where she is STILL on live, messaging me from the other app at the same time, and I finally said when I kill myself consider yourself responsible. She got mad that I would say that but I was done. In the mass letter I am asking my ex (pathetic I know, but I have nobody else to distribute this) to pass on to everybody, I have requested that my mother not have access to my funeral or knowing where I am laid to rest because she doesn't deserve it. And I mention in it, exposing her to everybody, that she couldn't be bothered to get off of live when I told her. I hope she feels like absolute dog shit over this. All this to say, I hope I am in the right. As an almost 50 year old woman with complicated mental illnesses herself, you'd think she would handle this better. Just ranting, I know it's incredibly long but if you read it all, thank you. I was already pretty determined, having suffered for years, losing the love of my life and losing my employment, but this was my last straw.",,,,,,,,

Potassium nitrite procedure,2533811,ferrie,"May 23, 2024 at 4:22 PM","Overdosing is far from my ideal method, but I came across lab grade potassium nitrite listed through a major retailer. I'm still undecided if this is an avenue I'll pursue because there's difficulties with receiving my mail without it being gone through & I prefer quicker methods. I am looking into more information about this though. I've attempted using the site search function, but most results just talk about SN or just don't seem very scientific. I did see that the calculated dose would be a 85:69 ratio with the lethal SN dose, though I would be interested to see if the mechanism of action due to the nitrite ion is the same & how symptoms compare between the two. Does anyone have knowledge about potassium nitrite besides assuming it's similar to SN?",,,,,,,,
Potassium nitrite procedure,2544529,ferrie,"Jun 1, 2024 at 1:17 PM","Bumping with more info

Potassium nitrite is a strong oxidizer with the chemical formula KNO2. High levels of potassium nitrite in the blood causes methemoglobinemia & its associated symptoms, headache, fatigue, dizziness, blue coloration to the skin & lips, due to the binding of the nitrite ion to blood cells, reducing their ability to carry oxygen. Sufficiently high levels can cause respiratory depression, collapse, and death. Potassium nitrite shares a method of action with sodium nitrite, but it takes more of the product to achieve the same effect. Its molar mass is approximately 85 g/mol. The molar mass of SN is approximately 69 g/mol. This is where the 85:69 dosing ratio comes from. However, LD 50 of potassium nitrite is cited at 235 mg/kg. Potassium nitrite is very soluble in water. At 0°C it's soluble at 281 g/100 mL, at 25°C at 312 g/100mL, and at 100°C at 413 g/100 mL. This is more soluble than sodium nitrite who at 25°C is 84.8 g/100 mL soluble. So while more potassium nitrite is required, less water is needed to dissolve it. It is also soluble in alcohol. Potassium nitrite is on the hazardous substance list because while not combustible itself, it may enhance combustion of other substances. It is non-flammable but explodes at 537°C. Overall, it is less ideal than its counterpart sodium nitrite, but in some locations it may be easier to source. I personally am still able to find it through a major online retailer. Less water is needed, which is nice. However, it would require more product, and your body rejects them mixture due to the amount of salt required. An equivalent dose of potassium nitrite to 25 g of SN would be about 31g. An extra 6g of salt may seem insignificant, but I feel it would probably increase the chances of vomiting even with an AE. I have access to online medical journals & make look into more research about it. It seems like an alternative for SN that would have more issues with keeping it down, but I figured the math on it might be interesting",,,,,,,,

Your other post you was/is a medical student and you have great passion for it.
Could I ask what you know of methylene blue? I know it's full of very good health benefits. However it seems if dosed higher it has the opposite effects. Since it's a treatment for sn poisoning, it helps the blood bind oxygen again… but from what I've read, if dosed higher wouldn't that stop our blood binding oxygen, just as sn/kn would?

Honestly personally I don't feel like any of us are really to blame necessarily for the circumstances we ended up in. Life is just a clusterfuck of random chances and an unpredictable genetic lottery + random family placement on Earth.

The fact that you try is beautiful in itself and I don't see anyone as ugly but I can certainly relate to feeling that way.

I stumbled upon your post just now and wanted to just try and offer a few heartfelt words.

I think everyone here is stronger than people who have never gone through these levels of suffering will ever know. Not to say that makes any of the shitty things worth it just that you're probably the farthest from weak of many out there.

I'm not trying to negate your feelings or what you're saying and going through though, I understand how sometimes this type of response might feel like that and I just hope you know I'm listening and there's someone out there right now who's reading your vent and caring.

I definitely agree that life can be just one big shit show and can also relate to hating myself for things that have happened to me

I wish we could all turn back the clock and avoid all the negative experiences and hardships the second time so we can choose to never have to go through them in the first place.

Life is just too cruel. Here's to wishing you some sort of glimmer of light in your day, no matter how small",,,,,,,,

This website should be all about respecting personal choice and the acceptance of suicide as a valid option, not forcing life valuing beliefs onto others. People who love life literally have everywhere else to go to, it's disgusting to see people just repeating the same things you'd expect to see outside of the site. The suicide discussion should be a place to let people vent openly with their only ever being support towards the personal decision to die, I cannot stand anything anti-suicide, it just makes me want death more, those who hate existing and want to die deserve a safe space away from pro-lifers. In my view this website in terms of content has became too anti-suicide and life valuing which I despise as I'd never wish to exist no matter what, I wish I never existed more than anything, to have the ability to exist is beyond undesirable.",,,,,,,,

The only time I have seen people directly talking someone out of their attempt is:
-when is will harm or traumatize others
-when the method will more than likely not succeed

Which I think are fair reasons. Nobody is telling these people not to CTB, just alter the method.

"Chlorine gas inhalation, does it work?",2598896,UnderTheSun,"Jul 16, 2024 at 8:18 PM","Hello,
I have been waiting for ages for sodium Thiopentone to be delivered and it still has not come it was my plan. Today I really need to go and i was thinking about inhaling chlorine gas in a mask, I have a mask with a chamber for my asthma inhaler I was hoping to use that.

I once did that by accident mixing vinegar I put in toilet and bleach, as I forgot there was something in there and it did make me sick for a few days.
I can read online 1000ppm concentrations can kill within minutes.

Is there a chance inhaling it through this mask system from a bottle or something will reach at least 1000ppm and kill me?
Thanks",,,,,,,,
Disorganized vent,2598890,sorararara,"Jul 16, 2024 at 8:16 PM","Hi I'm sorry if this isn't even fucking readable. It feels like my mind is being flooded and I just need to throw my thoughts out there. I would dm a friend but I'm tired of being a fucking bother. I know my friends are getting sick of me constantly being on the verge of killing myself.

Everything is getting worse. Things get better for a couple days but then come crashing down.

I feel so alone, I want to stop feeling alone. I vented about this in my last post, about how I'm alone but can't bring myself to text anyone back. I can't function, I want to be loved. I mean I am loved, my friends love me and most of my family loves me, but it's just never enough. Something always feels off. I feel so guilty. I'll never make anyone feel like they're not doing enough because I know that it's just my brain being stupid.

I just want to be in a relationship, I don't know. I want to be someone's favorite person. I've never been in an actual relationship, but it's all I think about these days. All of the people around me are getting into relationships or are actively trying to find partners, I'm so frustrated.
I could suck it up and get myself out there, try to find a relationship. I've considered it, but no. There are two big reasons why I can't be in a relationship:

1.) Who the fuck would even want to be in a relationship with me? Who would want to spend the rest of their life with a short, ugly trans guy who never shuts up about how miserable he is and needs constant fucking validation? I'm fucking annoying. Whenever I'm not yapping about how suicidal I am, I'm going on and on about some random interest that no one fucking cares about.

2.) I'm just not stable enough. I don't think I need to elaborate on this point, lol. I refuse to put someone through this, I don't want to drain anyone else because of my issues.

I'm so tired of being miserable and hating myself. I've been starving myself because it's the only chance I have at looking masculine. I'm already a little underweight, but I still look like a woman. I need to lose all my body fat but I'm so exhausted and hungry and tired and i'm in so much pain lolololololol I don't even know if there's a point to it, I'll never fucking pass as a man and the majority of the population will just label me as a confused girl or an attention seeker or some shit, there's no point.",,,,,,,,
in case you vomit...,2597075,Alessa,"Jul 15, 2024 at 8:41 AM","Hey there,

despite taking an antiemetic, it will be (highly) possible, that I will vomit when I will have my attempt. It wont happen directly after, maybe half an hour later, but I need to prepare for that case. Iam pretty sure, that it will happen when Iam unconscious, so I want to make sure that I will suffocate from my own vomit while Iam unconscious.

Therefore it's important to keep my body in a specific position. Definetely not lying on the side, but on my back, head a bit lifted, maybe a comfy pillow. But I also want to make sure, that my head stays in its position, not turning to the side. I already chose a nice place where Iam going to do it, but there are no ""devices"" where I could attach something. Its a place in nature, gras, trees, bushes around me. I wanted it to be a really peaceful setting with a nice calming sight.

So... how likely is it, that my body moves while Iam unconscious? Might be a stupid question, maybe unconscious really means no movement at all, but Iam not an expert. Its high likely that I will pass out after 3 to 10 minutes max, so I only need to prepare for the shit that could happen after I got unconscious.

I would apprciate your feed back.
best regards

My boss is asking me to house sit while he is on vacation
I was at a loss so I reached out to my psychologist. I haven't seem him in months because of work. I asked if he was free and he said no. No follow up. No offering of other sessions. I was going to ask him what to do. I don't think he wants me as a patient. My background probably turned him off.
I still have a potential, serious legal issue. It's been 17 days and nothing. But no doubt that it can pop up on me at any moment, at any time.

I thought long and hard about it all. The reality is that it's not fair to me to stick around and sacrifice when I was trying to kill myself just a few days ago. I thought of the worst case situation which would be for me to go back to prison. I did 2 years and was released in 2018. I was one class short of my master's!

I don't know what to do anymore,2598797,grimfox,"Jul 16, 2024 at 5:47 PM","I am depressed and socially anxious since I was 9. Relentless bullying, mental and physical abuse really took a number on me, sounds pathetic, I know. Getting beaten up by my peers or shouted at by them or pushed by my teachers for not answering fearing I would say something idiotic were every day things back then. My language teacher snapped my pen in half because I was afraid to answer her question in front of the whole class in grade 5 or 6. I spent my schooldays sitting at the back of class thinking and daydreaming about a better situation yet people singled me out for shits and giggles I guess. When they didn't make fun of me as a person they targeted my obvious mental Health issues. I get it, I used to put a massive target on my back for people to exploit and laugh at - which is, and was my fault whether I like it or not - it's like these people felt like it's their duty to fuck my days up even more for God knows why. And this is all I remember from that part of my life. I know a lot more has happened but I just can't remember. All I feel is pain when I try to sum these barely existing memories up.
I Never had anyone in my life who I could talk to about my feelings our thoughts in general, ever. My mother dismissed my feelings most of the time or simply told me to bottle them up since nothing can help me anyway. My personal favorite line of hers was ""I've been through a hell of a lot worse than you, kid."" Which is kinda true. She had it worse than me when she was young. My semen donor left me and my mom before I turned 1. He chose the alcohol over us. I guess he knew (or guessed, I dunno) that I was a lost cause the moment I was born so he left a bit later. I contacted him here and there, I don't even know why. I knew all along I'm probably bothering him - or he simply doesn't care - by reaching out and I stopped after a while. It's been a few years since we talked when I realized a phone works both ways but he never bothered to text me or give me a call. He promised he would but I guess he forgot or simply didn't care.
And this sums up a few things that still haunt and bother me to this day. I hate it so fucking much here. I've been planning to end it all but I don't have the balls to actually do it yet, and I honestly don't know why. There's nothing for me to live for, I'm just existing without a cause rotting in bed when I can or daydreaming when I have to go out for a reason or another.

30f autistic female,2598710,MorningDove,"Jul 16, 2024 at 4:22 PM","I spent all my childhood in my own mind, playing video games, playing pretend, anxious about OCD thoughts and that manifested in panic attacks and sometimes aggression. In highschool I had friends all of a sudden. In college I was depressed because I truly had no idea what to do. I was gripped by a terror.

The terror went away around when I met my boyfriend. For 4 years I deluded myself into believing I could go into this niche career with so much socialization required. But for at least 3 years, I felt so free of the terror. I could live and play pretend house, dreaming of a future that would never come. Would we own a dog when we married? What would we do when we took a trip to Japan?

And now its becoming clearer that this career is not a good fit for me. Maybe no career is a good fit for me. And my boyfriend is anxious as I have been on voluntary hold already. He wants a house and maybe some healthy children that I can't give to him due to my genes. He hasn't broken up with me yet, but we have planned on moving soon.

And I kind of want to end it here, in this apartment while he's out at work and I can set up a sign to call the police, instead of subjecting my parents to the horror of it all somewhere down the line.

I found this method on here recently, and I can't stop thinking about this one.

Life truly didn't get better.,2598749,BirdWithoutWings,"Jul 16, 2024 at 4:54 PM","This is just a personal vent about my life, apologies if that isn't allowed. I don't have anybody in my life, so I'm just here to scream into the void until I'm finally ready.

I've grown up always knowing that I wasn't going to make it too far. Classic sob story, born to an abusive single mother then placed with my grandmother where one of her sons proceeded to sexually abuse me until I sent him to jail (which resulted in me being exiled from the family. My CFS cheques were used so he could eat lavishly in prison+have a TV and other fun amenities in his cell while we had no food or water.) My first attempt that resulted in requiring hospitalization happened when I was 13. Tylenol overdose, obviously not successful. I just had consistent bad luck growing up. Around the age of 18 things temporarily looked up for me. I went from failing every class k-11, to being able to grind out all my credits within a year and a half. Sadly, I couldn't graduate with my class as a single credit wasn't ""processed"" properly resulting in me not qualifying to do anything with my class. That was a pretty major hit as I was the first person who was going to be graduating from my biological family, with decent grades on top of that, and yet, I couldn't walk or attend any of the festivities. All good.

I got accepted in university against all odds. I inherited money due to my mothers suicide and biological grandmother and great grandmother passing, so I proceeded to use that in the hopes of bettering my life. I moved out from my grandmothers home where I was consistently treated poorly, belittled, and having my belongings stolen and destroyed (the uncle who abused me had a daughter with a random white trash whore in the hopes of being able to skip prison time. The entire family tried to guilt me into not testifying due to her being born. When he was sent to prison, her white trash mother wanted to party all the time so that child was ALWAYS home with us.) I got a partner. I finally had motivation for some sort of future. I tried to study social work in the hopes of using my life experience to help others, but I was told by a professor I should drop out due to not being proficient enough in the language (french). So i did just that. I then attempted fine arts, as all I wanted was to accomplish something besides the absolute bare minimum. I did well in my studies, won scholarships and bursaries from my portfolio, I got a government position. I was delusional enough to think that things would actually work out for me, that was my first mistake. I lost funding for school due to my funding being reassessed (and never actually.. reassessed..) I also had to deal with my uncle coming out of prison. On top of all of this, I was stressing over a relationship it turned out the other party was never even interested in. The only thing that was keeping me going through all the other stressors in my life was the fact that I had somebody in my life I could share everything with and they loved me no matter what. It turned out I was mistaken. I spent hundreds in gifts for this man for every holiday, he couldn't remember my birthday and wouldn't get me anything for any other holiday. One year he lied to me and told me my birthday gift was in the mail, it never came. It turned out he never ordered it and lied due to ""not knowing what to do."" After half a decade of sleeping with this man exclusively, and 3 years of dating (in which he never ONCE allowed me to meet his family, or anybody in his life. His family assumed he was gay and sneaking out to see a man when he was coming out to see me once a week.) Oh yeah, he would only come and see me once a week. Usually long enough to get what he wanted from me, then he was out. Never once went out on a date. He asked me out, telling me he was going to teach me about relationships.. Yeah right..
We would only communicate via Discord as he always had excuses as to why he couldn't come see me (unless convenient for him), eventually he stopped putting effort into responding to my messages. If I wouldn't start the conversation, he would go week(s) without contacting me. Yet he would accuse me of cheating on him. While he was going to other women's places and hanging out with them. I eventually cut off the relationship as I was losing my mind over how one sided it was, and he proceeded to lie to me for MONTHS about how our relationship went, before admitting that he was never ""invested"" but he definitely wasn't doing it just to sleep with me. We proceeded to be FWB for a solid year after that, as I had nobody else in my life. My family, no friends, no nothing. Nothing changed obviously, but I for some reason thought maybe something would change.

I'm now 24 and I've got absolutely nothing going for me. I only make enough to cover my rent, no utilities, no groceries, nothing else. I don't have a completed postsecondary education, so I'm not even considered as an option for employment. I don't have looks, I don't have intellect, I don't have anything. I don't know what prompted me to even consider getting this far in life, as I always knew I was NEVER going to succeed in a relationship, in education, or in th e workforce. I was frankly just set up to fail, and I should have accepted it. I now have so much more BS I have to deal with than I did back then. I wish I had succeeded when I was 13.

The bright side is my ex's birthday is soon, and that's when my last cheque should be coming in which is less than what my rent is. I think I'll have enough fuel to be able to CTB on his birthday. My mindset is he ruined every single birthday that I had a chance of actually being able to celebrate, so he deserves to have one ruined. I haven't quite decided if I want to write out letters to people, or just make a few videos and have those scheduled to be posted+sent the day after. To be fair though, I'm not even sure who I'd leave message(s) to as I don't have anyone in my life who'd care enough about it. I'd likely just make a video stating that I can be used for science, my belongings given to a handful of people who were alright to me or donated somewhere, and if my body isn't viable to be used for anything, then they can just mass cremate me and throw me out.

Apologies for the long winded rant, I know it's incredibly self-centered. I hope anyone who see's this has a good day, and apologies again.",,,,,,,,
Life truly didn't get better.,2618443,BirdWithoutWings,"Aug 3, 2024 at 9:20 AM","I'll just post little vent updates here as to not shit up the forum with multiple topics of my self pitying.

I didn't end up doing it on my ex's birthday. An old friend invited me to a concert on the 10th so I'll likely wait until then at least. Since my last post, my landlord threatened to evict me due to lack of cleanliness (my place was clean. LOL), my pc stopped working (nothing has worked so far to fix it, so yay?), due to the PC, I lost my work for a contract I have to get done by september. So overall, feeling like I'm getting curbstomped while I'm already down.

Latest rant

I have a singular family member that I'm close to, being a second uncle. He pitched that we go visit my mothers grave which is a 3h straight drive there. Additional context, my mother was adopted, my bio grandmother was, her siblings, her parents, etc. This grave has 3 of my biological family members buried in it, my mom, grandmother, and great uncle. I obviously said yes as it's been two years since I've been able to visit, and my grandma decides to join too. Cool! She then decides to invite the child of the uncle who I sent to prison (who is 7 maybe?) to join us on this SEVEN HOUR TOTAL TRIP not counting the time spent at the grave, then local landmarks. This child blasts youtube on her phone (which she has had since she was 3) and whines about when her mother is coming to get her every few minutes, in what fucking world would I or ANYBODY else want to deal with that?? Not only that, but she does not know nor is related to anyone buried there. This gravesite, this town, everything about this trip is specifically related to MY biological family. I ended up telling them I won't be going, and to have fun visiting MY biological families grave(s) with her, as that's exactly what they are doing.

Bright side is at least I have more fuel to CTB as if the family who raised me are going to be that inconsiderate of me, it's at least a pretty good indication that my departure wouldn't cause too many issues. I'll simply just be forgotten, as was my mother.

Another bright side is that my family has no pictures of me anymore (my photos were considered ""clutter"" so we had to get rid of them when my grandma moved haha.) and there's no photos of me from grade 7-12. So if I start nuking my selfies and social media, it will be a lot easier for me to be completely forgotten, as once I'm gone, there will be no current photos of me to remember me by. I was able to start shredding my finearts portfolio as I don't want to be remembered AT all not even my work. There is apparently a prof or two who uses my work in their ruberik as examples of A+'s, but thankfully those will likely eventually get replaced with even better works. And even if not, thankfully I know that nobody remembers me or my work so it'll essentially just be anonymous photos if I really think about it. There's a lot of things I need to start getting rid of. I always told myself I'd give my partner of my friends my belongings, but as I've got nobody, I think I'll just try to find local people in need and give them what I can. There's some things I might be able to sell, so I might sell those items and then see if there's a local charity I could donate the funds to, as they'd likely benefit more from them than I ever would.

If anybody sees this, I hope the week has treated you well. Have a good one.",,,,,,,,

I know us Boomers have a bad reputation for being unsympathetic to you kids' plight in life but I cannot even comprehend some of the things I have seen and heard y'all having to go through. I have worked with kids who were sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with 5 other friends (yes, 2 kids in each bedroom and 2 in the living room) and they ALL were working 2 jobs and going to school.

These kids were NOT party animals. In fact, they would all describe themselves much like you described yourself. Slightly nerdy, trying hard and completely worn out. My heart truly breaks for you guys. Life is SO much harder now than it was when l was coming up. I have no idea why some old folks can't see that.

A lot of them talked about just going to sleep and never waking up. That was as close as they ever got to admitting they were almost at the end of their rope and we would talk about it a lot between customers and doing all the shit corporate retail America expected.

Anyway, I didn't live a charmed life (single mom, no child support or help from dad, no helo from my fam or his, it was just me and the kids) but I was still able to make it with 2 jobs. I was wore out ALL the time BUT ... I didn't have to have roommates in order to make ends meet. I didn't have to have first and last month's rent, a security deposit and deposits for all the utilities in order to move into a nice apartment, in a good school district, where me and my kids were safe.

I never had to worry about anyone coming into my workplace and shooting the place up. I never had to worry about my kids getting killed at school. Hell, when I was in high school we had shotguns in racks on the back window of our pick-up trucks -- that we left unlocked -- so we could go quail or dove hunting after school.

I could go on but you get my point. Life now is VERY different and to be honest I am amazed at the resilience you guys have. You have every reason to feel the way you do. And any time I can lend an ear, or help any of y'all kiddos thru a rough patch I am honored to do so.",2620165,,,,,,,

It's just a couple sour apples that's making the whole orchid look bad for others. That group of five sounds like such an exasperating situation for them to have been in, I hope their lives improved significantly since then as I personally would NOT be able to do all of that. I'll agree that the resilience nowadays is frankly impressive, though the origins of that obviously less desirable.

The single mother life is a tough one, I'm sorry that that man never stepped forward once to at least help out monentarily. I'll never understand people who procreate (even if by accident) and then proceed to abandon the child due to differences in the relationship. Once it's done, it's a commitment. Step up and pay, man. I'm so sorry you and your mother had to go through that. I hope it's something you never took to heart, as I know some people tend to struggle with that. It's seriously impressive that you were able to maintain dual employment to keep yourself out of the hole for so long. I did it for two years, and I think it removed a solid 10 years from my lifespan. It's also incredibly commendable that you went through all of that effort just to ensure that your children would have a better life. You seem to be a great person, and I hope that life treats you and your family well. It's sad to see such compassionate people on a forum like this while bad people get to live their days without remorse. I've noticed that a LOT of the individuals in this community seem to be intelligent and have levels of empathy that surpass the people I encounter in my day to day life. Though I suppose being hyperaware of the world would contribute to one gravitating towards this forum haha.


I'm going to add a little update for the day in this post as I don't want to double post since most forums have rules against that.

Day wasn't too bad, though I was indeed correct in assuming that my old friend would not be coming to hang out yesterday. Family worked things out and the kid won't be going to the trip tomorrow so I'm back in. I was going to charge my camera batteries so I could do some wildlife photography out there, but I've pretty much lost all motivation for photography as I have a backlog of wedding photos I still need to work on. (1.7k photos for free for a family member. I was lied to to get me to do the gig, and then they proceeded to not pay me while making me do triple the work+200$ out of pocket costs for me for SD card and an extra battery.) I don't have headphones so I can't doom listen to music on the trip, so I suppose I'll just suffer haha. My current plan for the ""future"" is to CTB once I get back to my lowest weight I got to, 84 (that was only in april/may lol.. I was forced to gain to avoid being sanctioned in an eating disorder unit.) I was somewhat attractive when I was that low, and I'd like to die pretty as I was hideous until 23-24 . If I die pretty, at least I can pretend in my mind that I'll be so forever. So far I'm at 116.5? from 136 within about 2 weeks so I'll take it.

Bright side for today, the Pokemon illustration is turning out somewhat cute so far.

I'll post some of the WIP's in my rants as I don't particularly care if it were to be connected to me. Clefable has been carrying my ass hard in Unite so I decided I had to draw her clutchin' up in her outfit i got a while back LOL. Drawing this on my phone with S pen because my pc still ain't working despite multiple attempts at replacing parts. Working on this has been great as I lose track of time, so I end up not needing to eat much if at all in a day. Great for getting back to my lowest weight, while at the same time preserving the minimal food I've got left. I might post some of my cooking abominations in this thread along with my rants as I REALLY try to fancy up severely expired products (and frankly they turn out pretty alright haha.) Next post I'll have to post my expired canned chicken i turned into star tendies and covered in panko and spices to attempt to salvage (was delicious).

Hope anyone who see's this has had a good start to their week so far.",2620260,,,,,,,

My landlord is still harassing me in regards to the cleanliness of my apartment. He emailed me 1 hour into my trip causing me to have a nonestop panic attack until i got home 7 hours later. His complaint? My cats litterbox, that i clean out twice a day and disinfect in my tub once a week (and then sanitizing the tub).
As a result I've decided I'll be filing a human rights complaint to them, ratting them out to the city (they owe hundreds in fines for not repairing massive holes in the foundation that rodents come into the building from.), and then the tenancy branch as I might as well get a refund of all of my rent from it. Thankfully 5 past tenants in the building are willing to go through with it along with me to ensure it's actually investigated as holy fuck. These people have accused me of flushing cat litter down ANOTHER TENANTS DRAIN and threatening to fine me THOUSANDS (they never even repaired it so it must not have been that bad, assholes.) Punching? a massive 5 foot by 5 foot hole in the wall (it was incomplete work from years ago from a contractor they didn't pay to finish the job. Resulting in a MASSIVE rodent infestation in my bedroom as the hole led DIRECTLY OUTSIDE., spawning rodents in my apartment like some sort of minecraft spawner? (prior point explaining why it was happening), and now apparently being so dirty that I apparently need near daily emails and visits to my place as if I'm not cleaning everything daily.

So out of spite, I'm definitely making sure to completely and utterly destroy my unit and this mans property (not harming the other tenants places haha) when I CTB. It was initially going to be a benzo+hanging+exit bag trio, but I want to ensure that I not only decrease the property value, but also traumatize the ever living fuck out of them.

At least it's a WHOLE lot easier to pack now, and I've left some empty boxes aside that should fit the rest of my belongings.

I keep thinking about whether or not to leave a note or video recordings for the people who knew me, but I'm starting to realize that it would be for nobody, as I don't have anybody in my life who'd care about my passing. I just wish that Medical Assistance in Dying had become available when it was supposed to so I could leave while still having my body be useful for science or transplants. It feels like a massive waste to die and end up being useless, but c'est la vie I suppose!

The bright side to everything is that at least my ex's text to me a few weeks back helped me lose a ton of weight. So I will be able to die skinny thankfully! I think I've only eaten 3 times? since the message haah. So who knows, maybe I'll be able to eating disorder myself to death before I even need to do it myself!

Rant about SI,2598742,kinderbueno,"Jul 16, 2024 at 4:47 PM","Why is it that whenever I make a serious attempt at suicide my survival instinct kicks in? I don't need it right now, I wish I could turn it off. It has stopped me from attempting in the past, for example when I was about to jump out of a window (not a great method ik) a couple years ago and my SI kicked in and I just backed away in fear even though I'd been planning it for so long. My first attempt at suicide involved me trying to slit my wrists open (again, very bad method but I didn't know much about effective methods back then so don't judge), and I just froze. The blade was literally on my wrists and this sounds dumb but I was LITERALLY unable to move my hand down. I was just sitting there shaking in fear with a blade to my wrist unable to move and after a few minutes I realised I couldn't do it so I backed out. Why does SI make me scared even when deep down I'm not scared of death, it's so annoying",,,,,,,,

I was recently looking up what CTB (I think it means catch the bus but pls correct me if im wrong) and I saw a PBS article talking about why the creators of this site need to be ""held accountable "" and why this place needs to be shut down for ""killing people"".

Not once in the article does anyone even talk about how we can even help ppl and stop them from even wanting to commit suicide.

Instead all they want to do is make it harder for people to get an escape from this shitty life so they can get off on their self righteousness.

""Oh no the poor families suffering want the site taken down cause their relative killed themselves because of the site""

Like if you loved them as much as you say they probably wouldn't have killed themselves but yeah blame the site that offered them a way out instead of yourselves for.not being able to help them.

There are so many reasons people comit, discrimination, abuse, poverty, disability, health and social pressure being one of the main issues and we can fix most of these issues by just not being shitty people and helping one another but of course we're not going to do that. It's easier to blame the suicidal person or people who help them find relief.


It's always, exercise more, go to therapy, eat better, meet the right people because it's your fault you don't want to live in this hellhole where the earth is getting hotter everyday, ppl treat u like crap because of your skin colour (just look at how wngland behaved towards sake after losing the Europa cup) or because of how you dress or who you like, people can barely afford to eat healthy cause everything is so expensive, it's hard to find Time to work out when work drains your soul. Disabilities wouldn't be so much of an issue if we cared about being inclusive and helping each other but no some buildings don't even have something as basic as a wheelchair ramp or an automatic door or elevator because it's ""too expensive or too much of a hastle"" to be considerate for our fellow humans.

AI is being used to replace the already poorly paid art jobs, and in the US where I live there's no communities cause I either have to love in the city where a bottle of water cost 5 dollars or I get robbed from walking the wrong way and there's no nature and there's just fucking concrete and cigarettes everywhere or I live in the fucking suburbs where it's just single family houses as far as the eyes can see and the nearest library or hang out spot is fucking 20 minutes away by car.

I haven't seen my best friend in person for so long since graduating high school cause I hate driving and even if I do.drive I can't keep the car at her place cause my family needs it for work. And if we don't pick each other's house there's nothing to do cause everything cost money

I mean I don't want to talk too much about my situation. But if I had children, I wouldn't be planning on CTB, because i wouldn't want to traumatise them.

I think that the selfish label comes from people who are left behind, who can often feel guilt or responsibility even if they weren't and can actually carry a great amount of guilt.

As for weather or not you think your reasons are selfish, that's a different story.

The last time I tried to CTB was after i had received a back injury. The doctors didn't think my back would ever get better and i was living in agony. I could only stand or lie down so I would watch TV and play video games standing. The injury had stolen my identity from me as i used to be very into the outdoors, camping and hiking.

Ironically even after my physiotherapist told me i would never recover my bock got better after i fell out of a noose in a failed hanging attempt.

Now was that selfish, in some ways it was, Does that mean it was morally wrong? no.

I am free to decide what the lowest standard of living is that i will tolerate.
And thats as selfish as someone saying they want to have children
or someone who eats whilst ignoring the poor.
Its basic human needs, nothing more.

I actually seen it suggested before that artificial life support exists a lot more than we might realise. This would of been in relation to how society has moved on so far from the era of hunter gatherers. Interestingly enough, Historically speaking Eskimos used to throw the sick and elderly out of the community to die. You will also probably find more examples of historic tribes who used to cast out the old and sick. Its only really in modern times that we have changed the definition of ""usefulness"" and found ways of keeping people who would otherwise not survive alive.

So I definitely don't think your reason was selfish at all. One of my fears is becoming disabled either by old age or an accident. So I would've definitely hung myself in your shoes.

There are new tv shows, new ads, new sites, new products comming out daily and artists work tirelessly to help bring these things to life. Being an artist isn't just painting in your room and hoping someone buys it. Despite how hard artists work to make some of these amazing shows, cartoons and products they get paid almost Jack shit because people don't value their work. Which was the point I'm trying to make.

Ai is made from being trained on artist work without their consent it is theft. Because people do not value artists they want to use their work but not give them money so they use AI. I've seen many AI products on sites like Etsy originally meant for artists and many people who think they're paying a real artist and receive AI instead.

AI isn't a scapegoat it is actually taking jobs from people and is serious. Frankly the starving artist trope is insulting because the world loves consuming art but suddenly when it comes to paying artists they need to grow up and find a real job cause it's ""not in demand "" as you say. Which is simply not the case at all.
That's such a mean thing to say. If you don't value the arts that's fine. But you're wrong art is in demand but people don't value artists. They don't want to pay for the work and they've stolen artists work with ai so now they don't have to pay the already shitty waged they give.

Artists demanding better compensation is not attacking others. And artists not wanting their work to be used to train AI is not attacking others either.

They are called artists as well. If I apply to a job in EA I will be called an artist. A designer is also still an artist. Just more specialized. The way a track star is still an athlete.

But corporate and solo artists are under paid and undervalued. People that make shitty corporate music deserve to get paid enough to live. And people that paint for art galleries also deserve to get paid.

Art is labour. I think because people are willing to suffer for their passion it's not taken seriously. But it's not just the arts either. Research is the same. People exploit anyone who isn't driven by money. I also wanted to do research in robotics and AI at one point but I found that unless I was interested in automating people's jobs I'd have to survive on bread and mold. Because I was more interested in AI for helping with things like loneliness and not to be mean dirty work that most people would not want to do.

This world is harsh. Expecting people to do all for you, or think the whole world is wrong for not wanting their art, speaks very poorly about you. Be self-sufficient if others fail you, instead of making a bad situation even worse.

Brain like a hurricane,2590212,sugarb,"Jul 9, 2024 at 1:16 AM","Just rambling again. Or maybe I'm on to something this time! My train(s) of thought will arrive at one last conclusion, one unifying constant divine realization that'll stick with me forever. But probably not. Either way- long ass, crazy sounding post.

I feel like the inside of my head is perpetually storming. Raging winds intertwining and spiraling downwards forming twisters that tear at the earth, crackling lightning flashing overhead for infinitesimal moments, thunder exploding in near-time.

ADHD, obviously. Dunno if it's because I'm also autistic that my brain's so fucking wonky, but it probably didn't help. here's an example of how I think sometimes. I hate it.

Ex: Say I'm browsing some site and read a post title that goes ""I hate men."" A hundred trains of thought immediately either start their engines or diverge to the new topic. With every passing second those trains split apart into new ones, like cells multiplying:

Why would she say that? Well, it's true many women suffer due to men. Do they? Obviously so, there're statistics on this. I rack my brain- I think it's true. But there're plenty of statistics for all kinds of things, aren't there? Statistics can be wrong. Statistics aren't always cause for extreme positions. But then I consider- well, it's an exaggeration, obviously. She probably doesn't completely mean it. But can I be sure? What if she does? What, does she hate my sweet, funny, wonderful brother? What'd he do to her? What'd I do, anyway? Maybe I did do something. Someone exactly like me. Or maybe I know her and I did something. I probably didn't. If I did she might've been overreacting. Or maybe she had a truly horrible experience, like an abusive father. It's normal to be wary of a certain demographic after said demographic does something like that, isn't it? But it's still discriminatory. Or is it? Gender's a different factor than class or race or attractiveness or etc. I wonder if she's pretty. Maybe she was SA'd? I wonder what the statistics are for that. Can beauty even be measured? Why am I thinking about this? Why did I even assume the poster was a woman or assume the post was serious? Might've been written by a gay dude about how his relationships suck. Might've been a joke. I wonder if it was funny. Maybe I could write a joke about that. What would I even make it about? Come to think of it I don't have a punchline. And I doubt anyone would even like it. Would the target audience like it, maybe? Who would the audience even be? People who hate men? I wonder who actually, legitimately hates me for my gender in the world. Are they justified? They might be. Maybe I'm an oppressor. Or maybe not. What the fuck are you on, dude? At least you're trying to be empathetic. Is she trying to be empathetic? Am I, actually? Am I even capable of empathy? An empathetic person wouldn't think to judge another person for not being as kind as them. Thinking that makes you unkind, though. Fuck off. Maybe I treat my mother and female friends and my female cousin who I think I admired growing up like subhumans and never realized. Maybe I did, but I don't think so. Would it be justified to hate me if I did it without knowing? No. Yes. Would it be justified to hate Ted Bundy if he had a disorder that made him kill people? Yes. No. Maybe. Is that a thing? An unending clinical illness that makes you hurt people entirely not of your own volition? Maybe, I dunno. Am I bad person for having these thoughts? Or misogynistic? I don't know. So long as nothing comes of them it's ok, right? Or maybe it's not. Why do I keep spinning around and around and around and around and around and around faster and faster and faster, thoughts like water swirling down a billion and one drains that lead into pipes into four-way splits and eight-way splits into an ocean where I ask myself if anything is real and what real even means and then take a step back and find myself in front of God and he or she or it or they or what or when is so disappointed because I couldn't slow down and use my brain. Am I stupid or smart? Maybe I'm the smartest person ever. I got good grades, right? But idiots can do that. Are they idiots, though? Intelligence usually refers to how useful a person's brain is for society; art music culture science math politics technology military etc etc. That's what it's actually a metric for. Can you stop disassociating and acting like you're unique? I'm unique to myself. The only voice in my head is mine. Maybe it's the only voice in the world. I can't prove it. Why would I? Can you disprove reality via debate? Can you conceptualize reality not being real and then articulate the idea? Of course not. Why am I thinking about this again? Existential crisis for the fifth time today, Jesus Christ. Just click on the post and actually read what it's about before you start thinking about it all.

-but I never click on the post and nothing comes of it in any direction whatsoever because I imagined the post existing in the first place and the last ten seconds of scrambled thoughts were completely pointless to begin with. Then I start thinking about why I even imagined that in the first place and it starts again (it never actually stopped).

This happens with everything. Sometimes I feel like I'm the stupidest person in the world. Other times I feel like a god. A biologist and a single-celled organism can both clone a single-celled organism; both can see phytoplankton, perceive things a normal person can't. Maybe I'm an idiot and a genius and a crackhead with no crack and a frighteningly disassociated ticking timebomb. Do I need to destroy myself before I hurt myself? Do I need to kill myself before I kill someone? To die to escape the hurt the world throws on me?

Those don't feel right. Maybe even that feeling of ""right"" is a lie. Maybe my real reason for CTB is possessing a mind so hilariously divorced from typical functioning that things as human as breathing feel off. I occasionally feel I'm here solely as a test. But the fun kind, to a degree. I'm here to pass some sort of challenge- survive the difficulties until it's the right time to finish, and have fun along the way. Maybe morality gives me bonus points.

Even though I wrote like the example of my scattered, wackjob thoughts had ended, this piece of writing in it's entirety is Exhibit A. I must sound insane. Probably am. What consequences come from pressing ""post thread""? This exactly 1400-word rant might be endearing, might be concerning, might offend, might give the wrong idea, might disgust or hurt. I don't know. Don't even know what I believe in any category of thought because of a thousand mile line of devil's advocates and counterpoints popping up. Why am I posting it, then, instead of confining it to my diary? I think maybe I'm curious about how people will respond. Looking for a conversational buzz. Or hopeful I'll read some response that magically quiets my brain. Doubtful.

During the brief periods in which the eye of the storm in my head encircles me- temporary, fleeting stillness- I sometimes catch a glimpse of Heaven, or my equivalent thereof. Musical climax and the sensation of warm rushing wind, rushing so fast my soul is sheered from it's prison and I become like the angels of the book I was taught, wild but kind and utterly whole, utterly free.

The glimpses aren't enough. Heaven is for the dead. I need a bullet in my temple to quiet the hurricane in my brain.",,,,,,,,

Brain like a hurricane,2628535,DefinitelyReady,"Aug 12, 2024 at 4:14 AM","I have no autism that I'm aware of. I've seen dozens of dr's and therapists without someone ever mentioning it. So either I'm really manipulative and can hide my giveaways, or I'm just not autistic. But I have my own versions of what you describe. I've also shutdown from some systems of thought because I simply no longer have the ""energy"" for it. Something shut down. I was raised to always be in a ""state of flight or fight"" and at some point, my system was too overwhelmed and just gave up. I didn't care what happened to me. I became numb to it. I had no fight left, and I could no longer move to flee. So whatever next ""bad"" thing was going to come, I could no longer prepare for it anymore. It would have to just ""hit"" me. This is the feign/fawn inbetween stage I believe. Anyway, since I could no longer care. Yeah, I became apathetic and lost my personality. If you no longer feel, you no longer can care.
I forgot where I was going with this... damn.

I just thought you guys may find the above interesting or useful somehow? Hopefully.
Dr. Iron, see below as well.
@Saturn_ @jar-baby @thebelljarrr @Dr Iron Arc

Well, I mainly just wanted to ask about you seeing the article ""I hate men."" and your reaction to it. My brain isn't autistic so this may be the key difference here, but why do care what the reasoning is if someone states ""I hate men."" Do you know that person? Even if a para social sense? Because if not, I wouldn't really bother myself to care what the reasoning is. If you don't know them, then you would know that you had nothing to do with their formation of that opinion. You couldn't have had anything to do with them deciding to hate men. The burden is not on you; therefore, you don't have to terrorize yourself with this self-interrogation. It's simply not necessary. You're already off the hook.
Maybe in some autistic people they can differentiate between when they're reliable/responsible for something, and when they're not. I naturally always feel that things are my fault too, but for perhaps very different reasons. The distinction being that I can apply logic to my reasoning that whatever is my fault, and facts to back up that claim. This is also a learned trade though, especially if you've taught yourself to be on edge, and look for signs of fear.

You would already know how you treat women, and can find comfort in that you make it a habit to respect them, so that stops that thinking in it's tracks because it no longer pertains to you. You don't have to drive yourself crazy. Hth

Brain like a hurricane,2628548,Dr Iron Arc,"Aug 12, 2024 at 4:45 AM","This hurricane of thoughts you are describing seems to line up with the overthinking parts of Anxiety which coincidentally seems to overlap and share a lot more traits with Autism and ADHD than just starting with the letter A.

I'm not formally autistic or attention-deficit. I feel like I am not so bad in those departments as other people I've seen. I know so many people who are actually super autistic including my own sister and most of them have just been frustrating to be around with how little self awareness they seem to have and how embarrassing they can act in public. Not saying anyone who's autistic in this forum is like that. That's just been my experience and since I apparently tested as normal when I was a kid I'm going to stick to that result.

I also don't believe I have ADHD since I don't even consume tik toks or YouTube shorts and many of the people I know with ADHD require their various drugs like Ritalin just to even function at a normal level which I am able to do. Another seemingly telltale sign of ADHD is feeling sleepy after consuming caffeine which does not happen with me at all.

And yet I think it's pretty clear by this point that I do have Anxiety. I know that fear in general is the dominant emotion running its course through my mind at all times. It keeps me worried for the future, terrified in the present, and even retroactively ruins what seemed like good parts of the past. Now I don't know to what extent overthinking does manifest in ADHD, OCD, or Autism, but I do know that with Anxiety it seems to be the most prevalent factor. It's possible you or I could still have some combination of all these or maybe just one but for myself I know that if I only got one then Anxiety has to be that one.

The thing you describe at first sounds like executive dysfunction to me which I touched upon once in a thread that I made and never really thought much about since. Like with overthinking I suppose this can also be a thing that can come from any number of all the A-disorders and such.

I think I do get the second part of your post? I don't think I have seen this 'I Hate Men' article in question but I do know that even if I saw such an article and I don't actually know the person saying it, I still can't help but feel terrible about it like I'm part of the problem. Again, I don't know if I really have autism or not but I do know that my anxiety has led me to assume that after seeing some of the horrible things some women have gone through at the hands of men who, like me, are lonely and hateful and idiotic, then that must be my fate if I ever even dare to engage in any sort of way. I don't even need anxiety to tell me that but I can't help but think that's what they must all be feeling. I'm sure I've already made some feel way worse than I'll ever feel about them.",2590212,2628535,,,,,,

Brain like a hurricane,2628961,sugarb,"Aug 12, 2024 at 12:06 PM","It's not the article in particular that's important, I was just using a pertinent example. The scattered train of thought that goes really disconcertingly fast thing happens with basically anything/everything, be it a social interaction or just looking at a lamp or something. it's just how my brain works

Logically, I don't really care what anyone thinks or says about me or my demographic, but the instinctual emotional response to degradation is distress. my fee-fees being somewhat hurt by negative input just exacerbates the already existing very fast chaotic train of thought. My logical response and the one I'll actually display in a social setting would be ""ok whatever"" and/or ""fuck off dude I as an individual had nothing to do with that"", it's just that when a train of thought starts it just keeps going. It's not a conscious choice to overanalyze and have the initial thought branch off into a dozen others, it just happens

My actual actions are normal (so far as I know), I treat women more or less the same as anyone else and have always done my best to treat my SO's well. And again, I'm aware that I don't really do anything harmful to anyone, like… ever. But the scattered thoughts generally just aren't logical.
Yeah, it's partly anxiety.

About noticing how some autistics are visibly strange/socially incompetent- I do something similar, but am also definitely autistic. Consult the Greg-Rowley-Fregley scale. lol



also: I very much understand your feelings about empathizing with others who dislike you and then internalizing their dislike to a degree. it sucks.

as I said above logically I know I haven't actually done anything, but… I could, I might. And as upsetting as it is immediate suspicion of me is somewhat understandable.

another thing is, Metoclopramide which is the most popular AE can actually be found in some online pharmacies if you do enough digging, some you can purchase without them asking too many questions. i found a source for benzos too but i believe you must pay with bitcoin and i don't think benzos are necessary ( i think it's meant for anxiety n stuff :p )

anyways, to answer your question yes it's possible to ctb on SN alone without AE's. i remember there was a case where a user on here ctb with SN and only took 600mg of ibuprofen. AE's are just meant to make the process easier",,,,,,,,
,2448834,Mayonaise,"Apr 6, 2024 at 12:29 PM","Antiemetics may minimize the chance of vomiting but people have been vomiting with and without AE. Moreover, vomiting does not necessarily mean failure, but in this case you should have multiple SN cups as a backup - even if some members did vomit and apparently passed away without additional doses.

Zyprexa is Olanzapine, an antipsychotic with antiemetic properties. 90 euros for 30 pills is insanely overpriced and I wouldn't go for it, especially since you mention the seller being fishy. Scopolan doesn't seem to be reliable for the SN method, I checked the active ingredients and they have mainly analgesic, antipyretic and anticholinergic properties.
It would be good for stomach cramps and irritable bowel syndrome but for SN you'd need a dopamine blocker antiemetic - even better if it also blocks H2 receptors.

Choking on your own vomit is obviously a no go, let alone the fact that you may end up with aspiration pneumonia if you survive.

As @bambibambam222 said, I'd have a look at online pharmacies, you might be able to find the right AE even without a medical prescription.

I don't have the drive to wholeheartedly go through life anymore; in fact, I feel like I am losing reasons to go on. That I am slowly becoming a more vile and bitter person with everyday. Sometimes I feel like I only attempt to reground myself because afterwards I always have a little more clarity on myself and have a little more will to keep trying. Sometimes I wish I would succeed in it. Maybe take some sleep aids, cut myself, take a bath and just slip under. Maybe follow some guide on here, I don't know. Maybe I'm waiting for a good reason to do it. I mean, if I lose my job and go so far into debt there is no recovery would people really criticize me that much? Maybe I'm progressively getting worse in my actions, thoughts, and beliefs as a way to push myself to fully committing. I don't know. I do know my head fucking hurts from last night. I called off work today because of it and I'm honestly thinking of trying again today. I mean I would have at least 18 hours before anyone even suspected anything.

I just don't want to live anymore, to go through everything alone. I mean, honestly, I don't feel like I have anyone to turn to. Even last night I thought about reaching out to someone, but I just sat there and thought ""Why would I be so selfish and bother them again? They have their own thing going on"". I believe everyone's life around me would be better if I died. Of course, they would be sad and grieve but, in time, they would see I did them a favor. A true selfless act of ridding them of my issues. It's for the best, for everyone involved, if I do it. So why can't I commit to it? If I feel and think this way, why can't I just stick to it?

Suicide still treated as a crime in at least 20 countries, report finds
One in every 100 deaths is a suicide: campaigners say criminalisation deters people seeking the help they need
www.theguardian.com

Here's the report by United For Global Mental Health: https://unitedgmh.org/suicide-decriminalisation/


Don't forget the punishments in countries that have ""decriminalized"" (apparently!) suicide! Punishments in the regulations of businesses, religions, churches, workplaces, places of residence (homes, military camps, hotels, etc.)... especially in the regulations of multinationals (companies so powerful that they manage to dominate the laws in all countries worldwide)!

Do not forget also the deprivation of state aid, allowances, the right to study, to travel abroad, to obtain your passport, to take your driving license, etc., if certain laws restrict this to the suicidal!!!

I am listing the punishments for you, but in fact, the list is endless!

1- forced hospitalizations!
2- being fired from your job, your home, etc!
3- serving time in prison (possession of illegal products, drugs, medicines, weapons, manufacturing of suicide methods, having consulted prohibited websites, having attempted suicide in prohibited places, or in places where regulations prohibit suicide, having said forbidden words...)!
4- social rejection.
5- medical record indicating mental illness, the ""cowardice"" of the suicidal person, etc., such as a criminal record (in addition to a real criminal record)!!!!
6- discrimination
7- disabilities, mutilations, etc., therefore all the consequences (loss of wages, autonomy, having to pay for medical and paramedical equipment, prostheses, probes, wheelchairs, etc., with few means, without insurance).
8- Media coverage of your suicide attempt.
9- censorship, manipulation of your words, we no longer trust you, you are crazy, your word has no value!
10- deprivation of the right to vote, placement under guardianship, curatorship...
11- forced taking of sedative treatments, causing you to lose your consciousness, your autonomy, etc!

So I've been doing a lot of research trying to plan my preferred method of ctb and have come to the conclusion that I feel I'm only comfortable with pentobarbital, seco or potentially SN if none of those work. All other methods seem painful and with a high probability of failure due to complex setup, higher chance of irreparable damage upon failure, and too much time before death to change your mind.

I know N (nembutal) doesn't exist anymore and pento isn't reliably available online. I heard some vet clinics still use it though so there must be some where I live (Canada)? Anyways, I'd appreciate if anyone could give me advice or point me in the right direction to acquire pento. I'm extremely depressed and basically agoraphobic so travelling to peru or mexico would likely be an issue, but if that's my only option I'll probably have to muster up the courage. If thats the case, anyone who's gone to south america to get pento, is there anything I should be aware of? Also, if anyone's serious and would be down to travel together that could be nice :)

Anyways, I'm grateful for this community, and if anyone wants to know more about me or just wants to talk, my dm's are open.",,,,,,,,

If I was able to get all the parts for an IG setup though, I would go with nitrogen. It's way easier to find than pure helium.

I was thinking of being a med student but I'm just way too inconsistent due to having way too many mental health episodes. But medicine is one of the few things that somewhat interests me, specifically neuroscience.

How would you do the CO method without putting others at risk tho? Thats what I worry about since it can be rlly hard to contain. For the nitrogen method, do you know how bad the damage would be if your SI made you take off the bag/mask? I feel like my SI would be too strong due to my anxiety and ocd which causes me to doubt and panic. I like the idea of downing something and laughing one last time at my brain blaming me and trying to tell me I made the wrong decision and all of a sudden making me believe that there's hope when it's been trying to kill me every time I attempt to try and get better. Ultimate irony.

Ya, I've also read that many are skeptical about DIY DDMAPh due to there just being way too much powder from added non-essential contents to consume, whereas the official maid method has specific lab made compounds that don't contain the other stuff. I would need to be sure it would work before I did everything. The DDMAPh method still seems questionable even if you manage to obtain the medications.

,2553201,ferrie,"Jun 8, 2024 at 11:45 AM","I actually really enjoyed school even though it's super hard. I have some physical health issues that made attendance difficult, but going part time helped with that & my university's disability support resources department do their jobs really well. I wasn't able to finish unfortunately, but the time I did spend in classes was nice. I actually had a roommate that did neuroscience as an undergrad degree. It was really interesting, just super chemistry heavy.

People tend to do the CO method in a car or tent with warning signs to limit the danger to others. There's also a GULPS machine or similar setups using formic and sulfuric acid that can attach to a mask. For nitrogen, it really depends on if you have the right concentrations. If your concentrations are high enough, you should be unconscious before you've gone long enough without oxygen to injure yourself. If your setup is done incorrectly & there's oxygen entering the system, then you're more likely to come away with a brain injury. The important thing to remember with inert gases is that it isn't the gas itself that causes death, it's the lack of oxygen. For any gas other than carbon dioxide, you shouldn't really feel anything physically. SI can still get in the way obviously, but there wouldn't be a feeling of suffocation or anything.

ODs in general can be hard to get to work. DIY DDMAPh just doesn't seem viable orally to me. Even just the individual amounts of each medication seem likely to make you vomit. The only way I could see it as viable would be IV, but the vast majority of people would not be able to do the setup for that properly. If I really wanted to do a drug OD, I'd go for straight ami.

,2553317,justwannadip,"Jun 8, 2024 at 1:36 PM","That's really awesome I'm glad it was good while it lasted for you. I've always had the intelligence to achieve things academically but my extreme neuroticism and mental health issues meant I could never be consistent for more than a couple months before having an episode or dissociating into addiction/distraction. Med school could have been cool. Story of my life is that I see an image of a good life I feel like I could have had if I wasn't always working against me, but that life is always out of reach.

When you put it that way, CO method seems to be the most available painless method. So why isn't it done more often or talked about as much as methods like SN? What's the simplest way to do the CO method? I don't have a car. And ya, I wouldn't try to OD on anything unless I knew it would put me to sleep and would kill me. Def don't want to have the horror of being in pain and having my body pumped by doctors, or even worse, having my SI kick in to where I myself call the ambulance. Can't imagine something so embarrassing and pointless as that. I've never wanted to attempt ctb for attention, in fact I dread the thought of people knowing I tried to ctb while I'm still here.

For nitrogen, whats the best method? When you say you don't have the means to do it is it just the equipment part? You mentioned that if oxygen enters the system during the inert gas method that there's more chance for brain injury; is that because you may survive it? Like what if there was little-to no oxygen but last second your SI makes you force yourself out of the car/mask/tent, what are the odds of brain damage then? I think that's the scariest part cus knowing me and how anxious and panicked I get around making decisions, I'll panic and try to get out once I've started unless I'm asleep and passed out already. That's why N and ddmaph are so appealing to me because once it's in my system there's nothing I can do about it and I should be asleep in 10 mins or less.

I really hope I can find more info or that a new version of PPH comes out and gives a tested and reliable DIY DDMAPh type method. I hope you find the peace you deserve as well, and that whatever you choose works out for you. Right now I'm at the research stage of things so I don't have a planned date or whatever until I get all the things I need. Thanks for all the info
Wow that's awesome.
Once I have enough money for the flight, I'll likely be going there too if I know whereabouts to go to find it. If I may ask, how much was the N? Was it reasonable? I'd like to know how much money I'll need for the trip.

,2553354,ferrie,"Jun 8, 2024 at 2:03 PM","Oh I totally get you on the seeing an image of a good life thing. I've tried so many times to reinvent myself & actually did recover a few times. I've just run out of any motivation to pick myself back up. It's really hard to bear when the life you want isn't something you can have.

The most accessible way to go about CO is the charcoal method in a car or a tent. There's a few megathreads about it. I think it doesn't get talked about as much as SN or N bc poisons are pretty romanticized. Plus a lot of people want to pass peacefully in bed. CO analyzers to measure your concentration are also really expensive & not everyone is able to successfully seal off their space.

For nitrogen, I'd look into SCUBA or EEBD hoods. And yeah I just can't get the equipment. I don't drive & don't live alone, so I wouldn't be able to do a whole tank set up. If oxygen enters the system, you are way more likely to survive. There has to be no oxygen in the system to guarantee ctb. Low enough oxygen may still be successful, but it prolongs the process so increased chance of SI taking over or being found. I can't give exact odds on brain damage bc it's very situational, but the longer you are in a low oxygen environment, the higher the chances of damage if you survive. If you abort quickly, you should be perfectly fine.

The PPH has updates every month, but afaik very little changes between versions. I doubt there will be an update that suddenly has a perfect DIY drug method, but I hope you're able to find some peace whatever you decide.

I def see why OD'ing is romanticized since it seems more peaceful/natural, and much easier. What do you think the easiest inert gas method is? I've heard some people mention liquid nitrogen as well but I have to do more research on how that works
Thx for sharing that. That's really cheap wow. Only thing I'll be forking out is for the plane flight. I do want to bring the N home tho and not ctb in peru as that would be extremely complicated and likely expensive for my family to have to locate me and bring my body back. Was it difficult to smuggle it back through customs? Thanks again",2553354,2553362,,,,,,
,2554255,ferrie,"Jun 9, 2024 at 9:31 AM","No electricity required, it's all controlled by valves. Inert gases are definitely expense & technical skill heavy. I've seen the liquid nitrogen threads too, and that would be the easiest way to go about it. Something about it seems too good to be true though, and you risk frostbite if you decide to abort. There's pros and cons to different gases. The main three I see discussed are helium, nitrogen, and argon. Helium is hard to find in a high enough purity, but if you can find it the vendor won't ask too many questions. Nitrogen can be found relatively easily, I've seen people say that they've even had it delivered to their house, but you might get some push back if the vendor doesn't believe that you know what you're doing with it. Argon requires a different set up than the other two to control the flow & I think it's more expensive. Carbon monoxide canisters are also a thing, probably difficult to source though",2554238,,,,,,,

I pretend I'm interested and attentive in conversation when I'm rlly not and surprisingly good at it. I was alarmed for a moment after realizing how seemingly well I got along with ppl, but the second I try to open up to ppl, they don't want to hear me out. I'm out of ppl to try and befriend and rant to so when my sister was texting me I just let her have it. She told me she doesn't agree with me and that I can have peace now and that we are besties for life and I told her abt my constant fluctuating opinion of her. I was (am) such a shitty person growing up but now I can see all the signs. If my sister did anything minor or even if she didn't I would get so angry and devalued her in my mind. I idealize and devalue ppl with extreme frequency and I have to remind myself to be aware of my condition and not let emotions blind me. I told her this and she asked me for an example, but I couldn't think of one with her since we've become more distant. My most recent example would be my college roommate who first contacted me online, we had maybe 10 lines of text between us but my mind was alr whirling abt what fun he would be. It crashed so quickly, he walked through the dorm door and I was already over him. Idk where I'm going with this, but I'm replaying my memories and all the signs are lighting up. Some ppl are offended that bpd has the word personality in it, however I can't differentiate between myself and bpd. It's a nice entangled mess. Yay self awareness.

I can't bear this anxiety anymore- it's driving me to want to die and at the same time is stopping me from living enough to actually go through the steps to get it over with. I wish there was a bridge nearby high enough to guarantee my death or at least I wish I had a car so I didn't have to Uber or ask for rides in order to get what I need to die. I've never used a gun before and I'm scared that that's causing me to procrastinate getting one but I absolutely need to die. The urge is so strong it's ripping me apart one moment, and then the next I'm anxious because I don't have enough money to get to the DMV to get an ID and then I start stressing about all the steps after like what if I never make it that far much less to the range to practice or to the counter to actually buy the gun. This anxiety stops me from living life- fine, but for it to prevent me from dying also is too much. I have to find a way around it. I can't live with myself anymore. I hate typing shit like this but this is the one place I can be honest about how much the thought of dying consumes me and why my anxiety is so high all the time. I need to get through my summer classes but I just can't.

Before some profound and life changing losses, I had a good life, I was able to function/cope, mostly..but once some things in life shifts, both the depression and anxiety expoentially worsened. And yes, I've tried every suggestions imaginable to allivate their grip, including therapy and medications. Some relief occured, but mostly, their grip on my entire life, remained/remains unchanged.

For me, the mental health costs have been financial stability, employment stability and a social life. I do not have any retirement savings or accounts, no personal savings, no one to fall back on in that sense, I live paycheck to paycheck and not all times is that successful. I've had a multitude of opportunties professionally but have either flaked out on the job due to the depression/anxiety/lack of confidence/unreasonable fears or just not started the job at all after accepting it. I have lsot count of how many jobs I've worked or been hired for but not followed through on in the past 15 yrs. Socially, I have withdrawn to the point I have zero friends. None. Not a one. Other than my spouse and store clerks, I don't interact with anyone. I am employed but not in an office setting so interaction with my coworkers is 99% via phone/email/text.

I think about how much different, possibly, life would be/would've been if it weren't for the mental health stuggles I deal with..would I, at 57, be in a leadership position? Financially secure? Have close knit group of friends? Would I not think about ending my life every single day? Would I be living versus exisiting and waiting for..what I don't even know anymore.

I started working, and having money is cool dont get me wrong... the problem is my job, I fucking hate it, I hate it so much suicidal thoughts are coming back after a while...
My sister got me this job, she works there too, I hate that, I hate it a lot, she lectures me even in front of customers and in a very rude way, working with family sucks... But I work alone most of the time (is in a gas station/supermarket), and today my sister came back to work after a while and I have a day off (I will be working all month with almost no days off), and this other girl that works there started complaining about me to my sister, my sister just called me and Im in a crisis because I care a lot about other people's opinions sadly, I admit I have flaws I admit that I lack in some necessary skills to do a good job here, but this is my first job ever, and I only had 1 week to learn everything, and Im dumb, yes I am!! and medication and depression has made me unable of remembering everything I need to remember... that other girl was saying I read in work hours, that I bring books to work to read (this is completely false, I arrive 1h early every fucking day because Im afraid of being late to work, I brought a book yesterday to read and I only read it before starting working, of course I dont read while working wtf!!!! she saw me reading but it was before I had to start working), and that I draw while working (this makes me feel so ridiculous omfg, I cant stop crying... yesterday, only yesterday, I drew 2 doodles in a paper we use to track something we sell, it took me 5 mins to draw those two little things, and I looked at them and thought ""maybe they will see this and laugh lmao"" omg Im so dumb I cant stop cryinggggggg) my sister of course believed everything she said...

I finish working for them in september, I wont come back (this is implying they will call me to work for them again lol maybe not), I will look for another job I dont care which one, omg If I could I would quit today....

The other thing that happened today was that I went to a psychologist (a free one) it sucked so badly I wanted to kill myself in front of her, I told her about my agoraphobia, and she told me it wasnt that serious, I told her that I have no pride and I let other people step on me as much as they want, she told me everyone is doing a lot for me and I have no right to be prideful, I have to stay quiet and accept everything people give me, also she said ""people with real serious mental problems come here"" implying Im not crazy enough or something, she didnt let me talk, I couldnt even tell her I started self harming again, instead of cutting I hit myself until my tears are because of physical pain and not mental pain, I have a huge bruise in my arm that I self inflicted, I couldnt even say any of this... Life sucks so bad, but I suck way more, I dont think life is bad itself, I think im the person that is bad, im the one that needs to dissapear, omg im so ridiculous why did I draw that? why did I read that book in front of her? why everyone believes the worst things about me? i had to pull all my strenght to be able to work, I have to talk to people for 8h many of them are rude asf, half a year ago I had an anxiety attack everytime I had to talk to someone new, this sucks, oh god Im so sorry...

There is definitely a positive feedback loop here where, the more you ask yourself why you are so pathetic, the more pathetic you feel, and the more you will ask yourself why you are so pathetic. To break this loop is an art of its own, and like @Sulyya said, I do think the main way would be to find something you would be proud enough to not care about other peoples' opinions, i.e, to establish a value system where your livelihood is not dependent on people you don't care for (or hard core escapism, maybe with lots of drugs, which I don't recommend).

As for the psychologist… I do suspect most of these psychologists need their own little psychologists and philosophers sitting on their shoulders at all times because I swear to god they don't give a sh*t about anything! It's easy to forget they are also humans (and probably paid fk all for their jobs), and that even the most respected scientists and doctors who make tens of millions every year make mistakes and are found to be fraudulent all the time.

First of all, prepare the actual rope setup. Make sure everything is sturdy, test the weight, etc.

Then I would take a few bars of alprazolam ( I think I have 2 or 3 stashed away.) These will probably begin to kick in by 20 minutes.

Then I would get into position, put it around my neck. At this point, start inhaling the nitrous. I can usually manage to clear 3 of the small 8g whippit cartridges (via a cream dispenser) before everything starts to go black (and it feels great). Obviously it is better not to breathe any air during this time. When I start to pass out from the nitrous, I will have already deprived my brain of oxygen for ~60 seconds.

The idea is hopefully to work as a shortcut to loss-of-consciousness, the nitrous will put your mind and body into an extremely dissociated hypoxic state, combined with the alprazolam, used to alleviate psychological distress and physiological survival reflexes that otherwise present major obstacles with this method.

I am very familiar with both of the substances used, and the way my body reacts to them. This is prerequisite, and the reason I wouldn't use alcohol even though it is readily available. It only requires the use of small, non-fatal quantities, so you can still easily change your mind after taking them, if you want to. For me, though, this is the only way I'd currently be able to consider using this method.

What are some of the potential pros and cons, or how might this method be improved?

,2593895,TAW122,"Jul 12, 2024 at 10:24 AM","This article is partly a vent but also an informative article talking about the current state of the right to die and how it should be expanded to include and cover (ideally) ALL people, not just those who are terminally ill. Before I begin, I will mention some of the problems that advocates for the right to die (or the right to choose death on one's own terms) are currently facing.

It is no surprise and common knowledge that to most people, including the pro-lifers, recognize the right to die and even support medical aid in dying for terminally ill patients. What is really jarring is how this right only extends to those who need it the least (that is not to discount their suffering as all suffering is valid) are recognized as having the right itself to opt out of extreme suffering despite the fact that for terminally ill people, they often are already near death or at least going to die within a certain time-frame (usually less than six months or so, perhaps even sooner). Many people (including pro-lifers, not withstanding some extreme, militant unyielding ones) understand and respect that for people who are in such predicaments. Of course, these people (the terminally ill) deserve to have a more peaceful way out and to curtail the unnecessary suffering, especially when they are near the end of their life (e.g. a terminally ill late stage cancer patient that is dying and will die very painfully). This mercy extended to them helps alleviate them from experiencing unnecessary pain and suffering while waiting on natural death. The point of this is for them to go on their own terms, their choice to skip the days, weeks, or months of unbearable suffering.

Quote by existentialgoof in one of his posts:

Many people without terminal illness are also facing immense pain and suffering. Just because it isn't caused by a tumour, doesn't mean that they shouldn't have the right to a way out of it. People with terminal illness are the ones least of need of the right to die - they are going to be dying shortly anyway.

The issue that able-bodied people face at the moment is that the suicide methods available aren't effective enough, and that introduces far too much risk into the process; which is unacceptable when one is simply trying to extricate oneself from a situation that one was entered into without one's consent.

Anyways, so outside of those who are terminally ill (as well as those with very narrow and strict criteria that fit to a 'T'), no other group or individual has the right to die on their own terms, and instead are just subjected to unwanted sentience against their will. So for instance, the people who are not terminally ill, but are chronically ill, severely debilitated (spinal cord injuries), and/or other circumstances, are instead forced to remain alive against their will (with some rare exceptions) to suffer while others keep them out of sight and out of their (the pro-lifers, anti-choicers') mind. Most of us see this as unacceptable as all suffering is valid and suffering is bad overall, regardless of whether one is terminal or not. Furthermore, the right to die on one's own terms is considered a bodily autonomy issue yet it isn't treated as such on mainstream.

What would I propose to be the solution? Throughout the years and previous threads, I have often written about allowing concessions and expanding the right to die for those who are non-terminal or those whose conditions do not improve. Ideally, having the right to die for everyone regardless of their condition, regardless of terminality would be utopic, but of course, that is not reality nor would that be acceptable to most people (whom are pro-lifers and anti-choicers), so therefore, concessions would be the more reasonable ask. It is indeed a complex issue and the fact that even entertaining concessions is often rejected and/or ending up in an impasse, resulting in no change, means that the current reality and consequences of a prohibitive society when it comes to the right to die and bodily autonomy are people who end up DIY'ing and sometimes causing collateral damage (which is a lose-lose situation for all parties involved – unwilling participants are affected by said person's exit and said person had to suffer greatly and take unnecessary risks with brutal means to exit suffering instead of having a reliable, peaceful way out).

In our current day and age, while there are more and more jurisdictions and countries legalizing assisted suicide and medical aid in dying for the terminally ill patients (and hopefully likely to be more in the coming years, decades), there are a few countries that take it a step further to include those who aren't necessarily 'terminally ill' such as Belgium, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and Canada to name a few. However, is still so much work to do, especially due to the narrow criterion as well as red tape and bureaucracy that one has to navigate in order to have a chance (no guarantees!) to access such services. So my solution would be (especially for the jurisdictions and countries who only have assisted suicide, or medical aid in dying for the 'terminally ill') to expand the criterion for right to die to include those who are not necessarily terminally ill, but are severely debilitated and have little to no chance of meaningful improvement (meaning their lives are always full of suffering and hardship, requiring around the clock care, little to no independence, and such). Sadly, in the example I've linked, the person lives in the US and even though his state has assisted suicide or death with dignity, he himself would not qualify since his condition was non-terminal. He suffered for more than a decade and he didn't need to go and suffer for a decade had the laws been more lax and accepting of his predicament as well as those who are in similar situations.

So in conclusion, this thread is made partly to vent and lament at the fact that while the right to die exists in several jurisdictions (and more to come throughout the years, hopefully!), it only extends to those in very narrow circumstances. Those in these 'narrow circumstances' would certainly benefit from it and while it would be nice and necessary, they need it the least when compared to those who are perpetually suffering, yet non-terminal and being forced to endure many years of unnecessary suffering. Make no mistake, I fully and absolutely support the right to die for those with terminal illnesses and in no way am I implying that they shouldn't get it. I am merely stating the fact that they need it the least yet most people would allow them to have a peaceful, more dignified exit, yet refuse to allow it for anyone else. That is the main difference and I am arguing that the right to die SHOULD be extended to all (ideally), but at least more than what it is currently.",,,,,,,,

I do hope as well that with small steps then over time, be it years or so that there will be significant change that benefits those who are not only terminally ill, but those who are chronically ill and suffering with no reprieve until natural causes. I think once we reach that reality (whether in our lifetimes or beyond our lifetimes), it will certainly result in fewer impulsive or DIY CTBs, especially the really brutal ones.

,2594576,Cress,"Jul 12, 2024 at 11:48 PM","I actually had a pretty long form conversation about right to die for the non terminally ill with a therapist And he actually agreed with me that It should be opened up to more people. Maybe at some point the times will change if you have enough people in mental health and medical professions that advocate for it. However at the moment truth be told people just have too much difficulty assisting with someone's suicide.

I think if we had a official system for CTB it would actually save more people than we lose. That might sound crazy but hear me out. Offering people a official channel for taking themselves out is a great comfort but it's also a good way To get people around the system of mental health treatment and making absolutely sure that they won't benefit from a small amount of treatment. At present there's a lot of people there never seek any help at all for mental health treatment Because of how abrasive the whole system is. The number one cause of death for Males under 35 is suicide I think it's pretty safe to say that the current system has failed.

Even I can barely talk with mental health professionals about anything that I have going on because they're literally always threatening confinement and isolation in the form of hospitalization. I can't tell them that I have sn they would consider it their duty to remove it from my possession. Unfortunately mental health kind of operates off of a handoff system the therapist/social workers and Psychiatrist's Hand you off to the hospital to be confined where no one talks to you and they just lock you in a room and bring a psychiatrist in once a week. After your discharge from the hospital your handed off to the therapist/social workers and Psychiatrist's yet again. Everyone just passes the buck off to someone else assuming the next person is more qualified to handle the situation.

Mental health Reform is such an immense need but everyone likes to pretend like it doesn't exist. Like if we just ignore it it won't be the biggest problem. Maybe if a politician gets elected and makes it their campaign Focus you might see something significant but at the moment we're a long way off.",,,,,,,,
,2594639,Forever Sleep,"Jul 13, 2024 at 1:57 AM","Even with the acceptance of more people, I kind of suspect the choice to die via VAD will ultimately, always be controlled by someone else. Likely doctors of some description.

That's not to say I don't think it would need regulating. I certainly think it needs to be ascertained that a person can rationally think about the decision, that they have fully considered all their options, that they're not being coerced etc.

But- what I'm referreing to is- likely a group of people will need to agree that someone's life is shit enough and irredeemable enough to warrant them being given a way out. And these are likely doctors- who very likely believe in modern medicine and their own abilities to cure most problems.

I just think it's set up to fail really. Doctors- who have taken an oath to try to save life are likely going to be reluctant to allow people to die. Especially relatively healthy people.

I've always felt like the assessment process should be done by an independant group of people who are specialists in ascertaining competency first and foremost. Beyond that though, I think they ought to know what services are available to offer people. According to their problems in life- health, wealth, quality of life- whatever. Not to say these things should be forced on people but, I think they should know all their available options and be given support if they want it.

Some people likely are still capable of recovery. Ironically- by allowing them to be open about just how bad things have gotten for them, they could actually receive the help they need. I wonder if it could actually save lives! How many people here suffer in silence because the subject is so taboo? For years, decades sometimes and with no help. Their situation may well not improve and only get worse that way- till they suicide on their own.

By legalising assisted suicide, it would bring the subject into the light to be discussed. Perhaps the more aware people are of people's wishes to die in the first place and the more realistic prospect that they now could reliably will make them more keen to actually try and help solve their problems before it gets to that stage.

I agree with you that assisted suicide ought to be available to all adults of sound mind (and to minors with debilitating health issues.) I think a process that includes a 6 month waiting term and assessments with people to sort through their reasoning would cut out impulsive attempts. I just can't see it happening though!

I actually find it so depressing that- even if we do see assisted suicide legalised worldwide, it will likely be for utterly dire circumstances. Sorry but- I don't want to have to wait for a bunch of doctors to agree that my situation is dire! I don't even want to get to that point. Imagine having to even go through all that paperwork, all those assessments when you're in that much pain. Imagine if you have to try and do all that on your own. Some of us don't have supportive families and again- care providers aren't exactly wired to help someone die.

I certainly hope assisted suicide is legalised for the terminally/ chronically ill. I think it's barbaric that it isn't already. I doubt it will help the rest of us though. Unless we fancy sticking around for however many years we have left at a level of suffering already (we wouldn't be wanting to suicide if we weren't already suffering in some way.) Just waiting for things to get worse- to a level where doctors agree! What a delightful prospect! (Sarcasm intended.)",,,,,,,,
,2597267,TAW122,"Jul 15, 2024 at 12:10 PM","@Cress Yeah, it seems to be very risky to have a conversation like that, because IF the professional/therapist believes (whether they were right or not) that there is a threat, then they would certain take action against the patient because of ""can't take any chances, better safe than sorry"" kind of approach. While I never did mention those topics back when I did see one (many many years ago), I certainly always viewed any interaction with the mental health system, whether voluntarily or not is something that is akin to like talking to the authorities and there indeed is a power imbalance. Even workarounds or whatnot is just risky and doesn't really solve the problem of the ever looming threat of saying the wrong thing and/or having them to incorrectly (or falsely) believe there to be a danger and then taking action based on that alone.

Also, yeah I agree with you that the MHS is indeed in need of reform and perhaps once they abolish involuntary hospitalization or even a temporary hold (up to 72 hours), then maybe, there might be more people who are receptive to 'help' because it wouldn't be mandated, or forced on them, but instead ""offered"". That would make a world of difference for those who WANT help but otherwise wouldn't have done so. Personally, I've already made my decision many many years ago so that wouldn't really pertain to me, but I figured I'd mention it because it is an important topic (albeit for another thread).

@Forever Sleep Once again, thank you for a very thorough response and taking the time to read my thread. I really appreciate it. To address the points, I absolutely agree that there should be some independent group of people whose primary goal is to adjudicate these cases (maybe they may receive special training and not necessarily have to be doctors or medical professionals per se). This alone would create more jobs and also allow people to make money (which goes in accordance with capitalism and such), and whether that is good or bad is a different point altogether and not going off too far on that tangent. Next, yes, I also believe there should be further ""real"" efforts to destigmatize the talk of the 'taboo' subjects in order to help those who otherwise are currently suffering in silence and afraid to speak out for fear of repercussions (involuntary hospitalizations, alienation, poor treatment and bullying by their peers and people around them, etc.). Once that is addressed adequately, and people can do so without having to walk on eggshells or circumvent and reframe their delivery, presentation of the topic, then there would be real tolerance that is needed to have a constructive, civil, and level-headed dialogue (which is where a lot of current social issues are where they are in present day - women's rights, LGBTQ, civil rights, minorities' rights, etc.). The talk of the right to die has yet to reach there and in some places are regressing which is really sad. So in essence, yes, while there are a majority of people (barring some extremists) who agree that terminally ill (late stage cancer patients, late stage ALS, and/or other terminal conditions) deserve to have a peaceful, dignified exit, especially those who are already near death, there is still much progress to be made for those who aren't near death (non-terminal) but still have chronic and severely debilitating conditions that make their existence far worse than death itself. There is also so much red tape with all the anti-choice and DRA's (disability rights activists/advocates) who oppose the right to die for people who also could benefit greatly from them (non-terminal, chronically ill and/or debilitated people).",,,,,,,,
,2597295,Cress,"Jul 15, 2024 at 12:46 PM","I don't know if you would want to abolish involuntarily hospitalizing people completely As there's some people that are so disturbed that they have no idea where they are in time and space And the only reasonable thing you can do is to involuntarily confine them. The issue is the system acts like a 1 size fits all hammer. Whether you're someone that's feeling a little bit down and thought about suicide one time this week, you can be confined in the same environment as someone that is in a complete state of confusion.

I realize it's mostly due to the bureaucracies and funding of how these places come together That they end up the way they are. However I think until We have a system that is Sensitive enough to be able to address the minute differences in mental health people experience in figuring out ways to address Those issues, Mental health is going to remain in a total state of Chaos for the patients and the providers of treatment.

I think the first step for mental health reform is early identification the main issue is no one realizes there's an issue until the patient is long past the point of no return or the issues are incredibly traumatic and severe. You need a system that is capable of identifying when people are in distress much earlier as well as a system that can encourage people to voluntarily come forward And allow themselves to be treated. Which of course requires That people actually trust mental health services enough to come forward.

,2598349,TAW122,"Jul 16, 2024 at 10:18 AM","I would think that the bar and criterion for involuntarily hospitalizing people (both those who are court-ordered or temporary holds) must dramatically change as the current criterion is too invasive and rife for abuse. One major change I would propose is only to involuntarily hospitalize those who are really out of touch with reality (like you mentioned, completely unaware of time and space, really out of touch with reality - through objective means, like not knowing it's day time versus night time, hearing voices or heavily under the influence of substances and may be dangerous to others, violent, etc.) Even in those cases, it would have to be minimal and certainly better than what we have now. You are correct that in our current system, there is little to no differentiation between those who are passively thinking about CTB (though for the fact, I don't agree that the thought of CTB alone including actively planning should constitute irrationality or lack of ability to make sound decisions - clearly people who do CTB have some level of cognizance of their actions and are aware of them, thus for people to dismiss that fact and immediately rule them to be mentally incompetent is an grave insult towards their mental capacity and ability to reason). With that said, I do think that it would be a fair compromise if the people who really want to CTB are given some waiting period, and if they still don't change their mind, then after some point (after they gone through all the checks and balances, verification, etc. similar to what @Forever Sleep mentioned about indepdent groups), they should be allowed the green light to go peacefully and with dignity. This saves unwilling participants for being part of collateral damage, saves the person from choosing brutal DIY methods that have no guarantee of success (with some that have probable failure rates), and more.

I do agree that the reason compromise would be where there is a system that is gentle and sensitive enough to encourage people to want to try help NOT forced nor mandated for the person, and also certain lines in which the patient is ALLOWED to go with their wishes. For example, a person was really depressed about their predicament, whether it'll be a loss or something that they cannot fix and they were offered ways to cope, alternative solutions, but of course after trying and exhausting those options (within a reasonable timeframe, like a year, maybe two at most - just throwing some numbers out there), then after that should the patient still find their conditions unacceptable (link to Canada's MAID criterion), they should be given the green light to go. In such a system, someone would be given ample opportunities to change their mind while also still respecting their ultimate bodily autonomy. Also, I do think the term 'mental illness' is still too broadly applied and often done so with the pretext of depriving one's civil rights and liberties, but that's another point altogether and for a different topic.

Although in the end, and especially in present day, anti-choicers and pro-lifers are simply not interested in concessions and/or reaching a compromise where they can allow some give and take from their side as well as their opposition (us, pro-choicers and right to die advocates). They just want to impose their beliefs and will and are afraid that any deviation or allowance would undermine that. Thus, it is very disappointing and as long as the present day status quo stands, people who may have otherwise not acted upon CTB would still continue to take unnecessary risks, going through brutal means, and inadvertently involve unwilling participants as part of collateral damage. I do not endorse these brutal means or the collateral damage caused, but I merely see it as a consequence of a prohibitive, taboo society when it comes to the right to die.",,,,,,,,

Everyone was shocked, I was shaking when I found out this bitch decided to rat me out even though she promised hospital was not necessary for me.
They asked many questions on what I do, what I wanted to do, why I wanted to do it. There were many inappropriate jokes and even some flirting (yuh man, i'd go with your wife, you go fuck yourself).
They told me that even though I feel better, the procedures doesn't permit them to not call the ambulance. So they did and we waited. I felt extremely uncomfortable and guilty for having woken up my friends and letting them know that I got some random lady calling the cops on me when I didn't even tell them anything. I am pathetic to the bone.
So I went with them. And again, even though they knew I felt better, they had to take me to the hospital to see a professional psychiatrist. The doctor though looked pretty much like she didn't want to live either. She asked me some of typical stupid questions and insisted on me staying in the hospital for a couple of days. I refused because today was supposed to be a good day at my place. So she let me go home, just like that, with nobody's supervision, whatsoever.
So I guess I got lucky but that was helllll a weird story and it almost felt like a movie or a dream.

Wake me up",,,,,,,,

Makes them feel better about society like something is being done.

I almost did the job answering the phones once. I thought I could help people, but the truth is phone operators aren't allowed to help. They're only allowed to listen. They can't give you advice or things to try out. They're only there if you need someone to vent to.

Also, in conspriracy theory ciricles, there's rumors of evil people replaying 911 calls over drinks and laughing their butts off. I know from first-hand experience that there's no level of evil the deep state won't stoop to.....evil people with unimagineable power who have no sympathy or empathy for anyone. So, I believe this sort of thing is common. They LOVE maximizing misery in people's lives and watching the misery unfold. Truly evil people.

If you're suicidial and not sure you want to die, go straight to a hospital before you call a help line.

I'll be wearing a longer white shirt blouse with black buttons that I am currently having tailored. The special thing about the blouse will be that it has a high 3-button collar.

Maybe I'll put my favorite black, fluffy cardigan over it. It makes me feel safe and I see it as a kind of lucky charm.

Underneath, I'll be wearing a long, black pleated skirt and thick, black tights. These are to protect me from undignity if I wet myself while unconscious.

I'll have my hair in a long plait so that it doesn't get caught in the noose and cause me pain.

I will print out some notes about some of my thoughts (which I need to start working on)
I will have photos & objects of things that I value...when I was a child, people that I love, things Ive made, etc
Ive made recordings of my thoughts (about 20+ hours) ...some are therapist sessions that secretly recorded and the others are an autobiography.
I plan on putting these recordings on a CD, flashdrive and on the cloud.
I also plan on having a container with all my legal documents, last will, account information, banking, etc for my family to have.

For both 500 g and 1 kg it's mentioned on their website the purity is at least 98% although the grade type isn't mentioned. Is the lack of mention of the grade type something to be cautious about? Vizzy's guide says the grade type isn't important, the most important thing is for the sn to have at least 95% purity.

I have emailed a company this week that starts with B & am not one hundred percent sure we're taking about the same - their logo has 4 parts & maybe they sell BM with a blue lid???
If this lines up, I emailed them (B with the 4 part logo) this week with a bunch of dumb questions about shipping etc & they immediately sent me an adobe pdf which I assume is full of the technical specs or a CoA or something - I have no digital privacy & was too afraid to open it. But they sent it immediately & that might put your mind at rest. And I don't know the differences in types of reagent & grades etc but from every single thing I've seen, it looks like the percentage is the important part. And I had planned to do both a blood test & aquarium test yesterday but only got the blood done before I was nearly busted - I'm not a child at home, I'm nearly 50 in an abusive relationship. I didn't want to cut myself as I was worried either I couldn't do it or the opposite, that I'd become a cutter - no judgment, just now is not the time to pick up new things…. Someone on here mentioned a diabetic lancing kit which I got & am thrilled with that choice. I got out 2 tiny white dishes. Put a little bit of SN in one - I think the rec is 0.1g but my scales don't go that low. And put a little bit of SN on a tiny piece of baking paper. I put a drop of blood into the dish with SN. And a drop of blood into the empty dish & poured in the SN off the paper. Both turned dark chocolate brown immediately. I hope at least some of this is useful… And may I ask a question of you regarding packaging please? - if we are talking about the same B with the four part logo, I also asked about the discretion of packaging (my hopefully legit DMC tell fibs on their packaging). I am in Australia & hope it wouldn't be an issue with customs & I'm not terrified of the government doing welfare checks like the poor UK people - but the B I spoke to said they only send to personal addresses, not to PO Boxes (which I don't have yet but was considering). When I asked about the discretion of packaging, they said they always put the logo on the packaging. And if it's the blue lid bottles, they look an awkward shape. My issue is my ex that I am stuck living with at the moment - I literally ran to the letterbox & got there seconds ahead of him & stuffed my SN up my shirt because it was flat packaging - if he gets to it first, he will use it against me - call crisis, tell lies to have me committed, blackmail me, anything - he literally went through my rubbish bin in front of me last night - so if we're talking about the same B & BM, can you please respond, either here or privately, & tell me if the outside packaging indicates what's inside & if the size or shape of it is distinctive or what I could say it was or anything like that??? I haven't fully decided whether to order from them - I don't have any other backup sources & it's freaking me out. I've long since missed my CTB date & may not have the time to order from a second source - but life has been throwing some extreme curveballs that have kept me here & if I find out I'll be stuck here longer, I will one hundred percent order from B & any other source that people wanna throw at me - prefs not the Indian ones because I know there's a tonne of stock shortages. Anything legit like a good lab. Anywhere that is happy to be discreet with packaging. Sorry for hijacking your post, I started trying to be helpful to you & then it took an ADHD turn & here we are…. so sorry
I was writing at the same time as @StevFabi was posting - my letters start & end the same with the same amount of letters. So I'm pretty confident we're talking about the same thing, & hoping it's the same as OP.
If anyone at all has answers about packaging, either now as in already received, or in the future if yet to receive, I'd be super grateful if that was passed on, either on this thread or in private. My questions are at the bottom of my response to OP. I posted my original answer, then saw @StevFabi response & tried to write a second & it sent as one so if this one merges as well, I'm very sorry.

,2579676,TAW122,"Jun 29, 2024 at 11:52 PM","Disclaimer: Before I begin, I want to state that I don't support either system as they are both carceral in nature and both have devastating consequences for those who end up in either of them. These consequences include, but are not limited to the loss of freedom, civil liberties, and many other social, financial, legal, and/or professional consequences. While I have written threads on this as well as expressed my stance, this article briefly touches on it, but also reiterates my previous stance and explain more in depth of my reasoning and analysis of my stance. Some of the threads or quotes may have been buried or no longer available on SaSu (after it got purged or deleted from years ago), but the general idea and whatever I could scour as references in this thread I will include or link to. Furthermore, if I were to try to find every thread, it would be too exhaustive for me, and besides that, it would be redundant.

With that said, this thread will explain and focus on why I think those who end up in the criminal justice system (will refer to it as CJ in this thread) are 'slightly' better off than those who are in the mental health system, especially with regards and respect to civil rights, and bodily autonomy. Keep in mind that I'm not saying that those who end up in the CJ system with problems and troubles are having an easier time, but between the two carceral systems, the CJ system is the lesser of the two evils and I will explain why in this thread.

The most important distinction between both carceral systems is that in one of them, you lose your credibility, anything you say is automatically, by default, invalidated and deemed unreliable testimony or word (the mental health system – once you are branded or labeled as mentally unwell, ill, or irrational, you effectively have little to no defense against such claims or (almost) anything that happens to you). This effectively renders one just about completely defenseless and at the mercy of the system and the people within that system. However, for the CJ system, at least there are much more protections, even if one does get a bad reputation or face a lot of stigma and social consequences. These include: due process, right to a lawyer, innocent (from a legal standpoint – not public standpoint per se!) until proven guilty, recourse for false imprisonment, and many other legal remedies. There are simply (almost) none for the mental health system and far more insulting is that even testimony and stories from victims of psychiatric harm are easily invalidated by the public. There is simply almost no recourse! Now of course, maybe things are slowly changing and more people are coming to their senses and becoming more skeptical of the psychiatric system, but that may take decades or much longer, though I digress.

Additional distinctions include the aftermath of the CJ system, there are organizations that seek justice (especially for the ones who are falsely convicted and later exonerated) such as The Innocence Project, Exoneration Project, Equal Justice Initiative to name a few and even in the eyes of the public, there are some supports for those kinds of false convicts. Legally speaking, there may even be civil awards (usually monetary though) for the wrongly accused and incarcerated. But for the psychiatric system and mental health system, almost none at all. Worse yet, even the public perception is automatically mental health system did nothing wrong and the person who was ""wrongly"" incarcerated deserved it. In cases like these, it should make one be very angry and out in the streets raising hell, but I digress.

While there are organizations that stick up for those who are harmed by the psychiatric industry and mental health system such as the Citizens Commission for Human Rights, MindFreedomInternational, Anti Psychiatry Coalition, to name a few, they are often far and few, and still far from mainstream. In fact, they even suffer backlash from the public for sticking up for the ones who are wrongly incarcerated and treated. There are also no legal recourse for those who are harmed or wronged by them. The automatic presumption that those who are in those carceral systems deserved it or are 'helped' because they needed it is not only presumptuous, ignorant, but also very insulting towards those who are genuinely harmed and such. The CJ system itself is even pro-psychiatry and supports the carceral system itself, which is why the patients who have been mistreated or wronged by said mental health system would also have a hard time for any justice at all! In present day, we have yet to reach a point in society or have enough social and legal institutions that counter (or at least serves as a third part, a check and balance) towards the psychiatric system and mental health system.

In the end, these people who are in the mental health system not only suffer greatly, but have fewer options for recourse than those who are in the CJ system. While both person(s) outcomes are similar and often abysmal in the end, the one who was wronged in the CJ system at least have a slightly better chance of justice and recourse than those who are in the mental health system. This is because in the criminal justice system, at least people recognize the flaws within it, the injustices and horrible treatment of people (especially the innocent or wrongfully convicted). As usual, I'm not going get into all the semantics and pedantic terminologies of such as that detracts from this article and I have already discussed in other threads already without being redundant. I have listed some threads as references that delve into some of the points I've discussed in this article. Finally, this is not to glorify either system as both are carceral and very damaging to a person's existence among original problems and challenges that are a part of sentience by default.

Prisoners get to sleep on real mattresses with sheets, can watch tv or go outside for a limited amount of time, and they also have the privilege of being separated by gender. Meanwhile victims of involuntary holds in psych hospitals have to sleep on a plastic mattress with no sheets, cannot have any media, cannot go outside, and worst of all are forced to stay in mixed-gender units. Can you imagine being a woman who experienced domestic violence or rape and being suicidal because of that, then you're locked up in a psych ward that is chock full of strange men all around you?

I would rather stare at the wall than watch TV, but they don't have TVs either. We were not allowed outside of our cells, let alone outdoors. The only time I ever saw the sun was when they loaded us onto buses to go to court. I had not been convicted of anything. My crime was carrying a neodymium magnet. After 1 week I was released at court but people fighting bigger charges or awaiting trial were being held under the same conditions indefinitely.

Only once you are convicted of a serious crime, do you get the privilege of going to prison. In California, many inmates have to serve their full prison sentences in county jails due to overcrowding. Thus lesser criminals (drug dealers, shoplifters...) are subject to far worse conditions than someone convicted of murder or sexual assault.

I had never heard that about the psych ward being co-ed. That is absolutely nuts.

The psych ward in jail is such that, if you put a healthy person in there, they would lose their fucking mind. Never, ever, ever tell the police or jail staff that you are feeling suicidal. Really wish someone had told me that before instead of find out the hard way.",2580917,,,,,,,

Multiple organizations you listed are Scientology-fundeded organizations with links to Scientology.

Because Scientology has practices which are obviously cult-like, any organization associated with Scientology is looked at with skepticism because some of the practices of Scientology (ostracizing people who try to leave, taking large amounts of money from people who can't afford it) seems questionable and unethical.

Even if it is good to fund organizations critical of psychiatry, Scientology is doing a disservice to criticizing these industries because it is taking away any legitimacy of being critical of those industries. If you don't like psychiatry and the mental health industry, then perhaps you are just some ""crazy cult member."" There are valid reasons to criticize that industry and people should be able to be critical of that industry without being associated with a religion or cult and the fact that some of the largest organizations criticizing psychiatry are linked to a cult makes genuine and valid criticism less effective or likely to gain traction.",2579676,,,,,,,

Sensory deprivation and isolation for prolonged periods is torture and they are all part of a system that reaps the rewards of torturing people and enjoys nice paychecks and lifestyles by hurting the most vulnerable, claiming they were helping, and taking their money. Even those in that industry not a part of that particular brand of torture still are a part of it because they profit from the industry and are in a position to be able to stand up to it and try to stop it, but greed prevents them.",2582551,,,,,,,

With regards to the comments about the carceral system being just the lesser of two evil carceral systems, I agree and believe that is indeed the case when it comes to a person's rights. Of course, both systems are flawed and harmful and no person should ever prefer to end up in either one, but for the sake of discussion and recourse, if one were to end up in one, it is slightly better to end up in one where one at least have some legal rights and social standing to fight against the allegations.

,2594477,needthebus,"Jul 12, 2024 at 8:53 PM","I am not inherently critical of Scientology for people who want to do it. I don't know about the organization. The reality is other people see it as cult-like which makes people distrustful.

When you are have 95 percent of criticism coming from one extremely distrusted group, the criticism may actually legitimize the object of criticism rather than result in critique.

It would be the same if the KKK was very critical of psychiatry. Because people have negative associations about the KKK (very rightfully), those negative associations would result in elevating psychiatry instead of real discussion about flaws in the profession and mental health industry.

The fact is many former Scientologists have said they were mistreated while a part of Scientology and were unable to easily leave. If Scientology wanted to have more renewed interest from many people, they would do much better getting rid of any pressure for people to stay and engaging in any financial exploitation and being extremely clear about their costs and why they charge certain things. Scientology scares me.

Although many criticisms of psychiatry are legitimate, many people get turned off as soon as they recognize it's Scientology. There would still probably be criticism of psychiatry without Scientology, but it would be more mainstream and legitimized. As it stands, being highly critical of the mental health industry and psychiatry has become equivalent to being ""anti-science"" and they really should not be inherently the same unless someone is just outright rejecting all double-blind peer-reviewed studies and metastudies completely without understanding statistics or science.",2593906,,,,,,,
,2597318,LemonLimePie,"Jul 15, 2024 at 1:10 PM","My autistic father made the mistake of expressing passive suicidal thoughts at a yearly physical. 5 days later (weekends don't count towards a 72 hour hold) at his hearing, after he had been roughed up by police officers, handcuffed to a hospital bed (metal handcuffs, not soft restraints), threatened with catheterization in the ER (he was too anxious to produce a urine sample in front of a nurse for drug testing), and drugged with Ativan and left in an empty room with only a gym mat on the floor to lay on for days at a psych hospital, we were able to get him out with the help of lawyer friend. We were lucky, the judge told us in 99% of his cases he extends the involuntary hold.

There has to be a balance somewhere, sure, maybe people believe they're doing good and maybe a small percentage of people are genuinely helped, but the majority of these hospitals (especially freestanding ones who specialize in psychiatry) are for-profit institutions before anything else, and are rife with abuse.

I am sure people who endure such experiences are actually more likely to ultimately kill themself over the next 5 years as opposed to people who don't endure such treatment

the reason it continues is financial exploitation by a morally depraved industry that preaches about wellness, and mental health, but just wants money at the end of the day.

they could do studies on the 5 year mortality rate of people who express suicidal urges and are involuntarily hospitalized in cruel ways versus not, but they won't do them because the results don't increase their profit. They would also claim it's impossible to do such studies because of co-variance between those that are forcibly hospitalized and those having worse symptoms, but it's just a lie and they could measure that with independent and self-reported data and try to statistically correct for that.

they aren't interested in what patients forcibly treated in shit holes think because these patients are required to pay after discharge or the state is required to pay, so it doesn't matter. they don't care about real patient outcomes and don't have any data on whether they do anything other than create trauma, but if you have enough fancy diplomas the government is willing to accept cruelty as a solution, ignoring the lack of measurable positive outcomes and blatant financial exploitation by these parasitic fucks.",2597318,,,,,,,

I suppose the best way would be for someone to not be apart of certain associations or have ties with such organizations that have a bad reputation when presenting their argument, as to prevent ad hominem (a fallacy where the opposition attacks the person/organization rather than the argument) attacks on the person while ignoring any legitimate arguments and/or critiques of a flawed, abusive system. On that note, I do think various individuals or certain independent organizations or groups that criticize psychiatry may be able to sway or at least open the minds of many people who seem to blindly believe that psychiatry is infalliable or benevolent (far from it actually).

I'm very sorry to hear about that, and also this is why any interaction with medical professionals or just about anyone within the medical field one should always consider it as an interrogation or such. Even worse, according to your story, it was 'passive suicidal ideation', so even under their own ""flawed"" criteria for threat assessment, it shouldn't have resulted in an temporary hold! Of course, sadly, many pro-psychiatry proponents and apologists will often discount, downplay, or otherwise dismiss such an occurrence being a thing at all. Or even some people talk about 'work arounds' but really those simply fail to fix the systemic issues or point out the fact that the field itself is abusive and often unchecked (just as a note: Similar organizations, organizations that are sympathetic towards psychiatry, or even itself is NOT considered a reliable witness, there is often favoritism within them all). I do believe that people within the field itself or even those who defend it simply ignore the edge cases or even downplay the horrors that occured and for the victims who seek to get justice or restitution, they are either ridiculed, ignored, or further victimized by the same people who defend said system. I just view psychiatry as the 'social system' which is interwined with the legal system (albeit separate, they are bedfellows due to both their carceral, paternalistic, and invasive systems in regulating and policing it's citizens while violating their rights).

If possible I hope your father is able to find peace in whatever he ends up choosing to do and ideally, maybe seek restitution (if possible) for the damages incurred on him. I could say if I ended up in his situation (or worse), I would definitely not be here today, but I digress.


Also, absolutely on point. This is yet just another example of the psychiatric industry and it's proponents trying to cover up the truth and ultimately trying to make money off the powerless. Of course, no one who is actively working in that field would ever admit, and worse yet, they may even become defensive, aggressive, and hostile towards any critique that would otherwise bring to light the harms of the field itself.",2594477,2597318, ,,,,,

Some Change of Plans:
- Refuse to drink the Propanolol and just decided to take it over the hours
- After reading this thread I decided 5g was more comfortable for me
- Refused to fast more than 8 hours because it makes me hungry

Experience:
- Low fear and anxiety, even as I swallowed the SN (wrapped in Rizla Paper) I did not feel an overwhelming regret, I felt nothing
- I have no Tachycardia from all the Propanolol
- I didn't experience any vomitting while I was awake, but I did vomit in my sleep (slept sideways)
- I don't have much anxiety, though i would be lying if I didnt fear death (I was scared of hell lol)
- I felt no pain or major discomfort, the only discomfort was stomach feels churning, but its very negligible
- SN makes breath taste like nasty bleach
- I also woke up being sort of deaf for some reason, not sure if it will go away, it might be because of Propanolol and not SN

Do you remember how long it took for you to feel the effects of the SN such as nausea, light headedness, fatigue? Was it pretty much instantaneous or did it take several minutes?

anxiety is mild to moderate (scared of death), stomach feels like sort of heavy/churning (extremely mild discomfort). I was able to sleep 10-15 min into the process. Dont remember any of the vomitting.

Keep in mind this is with 7g on top of 900mg Propanolol (very important for anxiety due to high heart rate), so if you take 15-20g it will be different and there is likely more pain/discomfort/anxiety/nausea.

Now i still think non existence is better, but when you are given life, you most likely have something to lose, unless youre terminally ill, homeless, deformed, etc (then i would sui 100% because its just delaying the inevitable). My new perspective now is to focus on short term pleasures and have zero fucks about anything (easier said than done), then die. I also kinda believe in reincarnation, so if i sui i will just skip trillions of years until i get reborn again or some shit, so theres that.

If youre asking if i called emergency during my attempt, no i didnt.

TLDR: suicide doesnt solve the problem, neither does living, suicide makes you stop having MORE problems. You cant rest if you die, and time passes in an instant. Not to mention reincarnation.

Place it in the back of the throat and then swallow it with a little water. But its a little hard initially, thats why you should use small paper bombs so that you can swallow them without water (this will make it easier to overcome SI).",2598162,2598163,,,,,,

I m thinking ingesting this way 5 or 7 rizla bombs containing 2-3 grams of SN before feeling its effects quick in, would require very good coordination.

You have more than enough time to do that. When i ingested the SN, i could still walk down the stairs after 5 minutes. Its only after 15 minutes that i dont want to move anymore.

I think i will warn you though, i have a feeling that using rizla paper might have a higher failure rate because the SN isnt absorbed as quick as if its dissolved.

I m close to 100 kilos and I don't think i could ever drink 35 grams of SN. Also I don't have propanolol but I do have benzos and AE.",2598193,,,,,,,
,2598259,Mebius,"Jul 16, 2024 at 8:34 AM","i think you shouldnt overcomplicate it, just take one.

Either you take lots of SN rizla bombs (maybe 30g divided by 2g) and spare yourself drinking a horrid solution (at the expense of higher failure rate), or just go with 35g dissolved SN and try to go through it. From what i've read though, the taste is extremely horrible (even from my own experience, the burps alone has a clear bleach aftertaste) and would probably ruin what should be a peaceful last moment.

Also, you should probably try to get propanolol, because it synergizes with SN (methemoglobinemia + hypotension), increasing rate of lethality + peace. You might be able to get them online.

I took low dose because i was taking my chances, due to people dying from way lower (2g, and some accident over someone eating SN instead of salt).

My estimation on the lethality rate for me, 7g SN + 900mg Propanolol was probably around 50%.",2598210,,,,,,,

It's probably true that my personal experiences have helped quell my own fears. I've seen 3 family members pass from cancer and one truly from old age.

,2547957,Alex Fermentopathy,"Jun 11, 2024 at 7:39 AM","That's a scheduled message. I set it one week after a supposed CTB.

I have SN and antiemetics at home, and a full-hanging setup ready. But I will electrocute my heart like in this thread of mine:
https://sanctioned-suicide.net/thre...by-an-electrical-engineer-2022-photos.160648/

Wires are already connected to my heart area, everything is ready. I took painkillers (Metamizole + Ibuprofen) about an hour before, so they should start working at full or close to that.

I am not afraid of physical pain much, at least if I know that it will not last long. I even curious: how painful it could be? I will be even glad to feel some pain in the heart, cause that would mean that the heart would not last long.
I feel like no physical pain can be worse than an acute mental attack of my diseases, which I had sometimes.
Still, I started to feel a bit anxious at the last moments.

And that disease is my number 1 reason. It's a self-diagnosed biotin-dependent fermentopathy, an orphan (very rare) genetic metabolic disease of the brain, for which I blame the fact that my father worked as an air defence officer before my conception (and there are scientific studies linking the offspring of air defence officers with much increased rate of genetic mutations). As you've probably already guessed, that's why I have this profile picture.

My number 2 reason is a tinnitus and a partial hearing loss for which I partially blame my mother because she forced me to wake up in the morning and go with her to sea when I wanted to sleep, and yelled at me (that was at my 8 years at our vacation). So I made deep dives out of resentment (I don't like to be yelled at, especially when I had not enough sleep), pretending that I was drown, so I got otitis in a left ear and a slight hearing loss (at first I noticed it only as a sligh disbalance in headphones). About 20 years later, tinnitus developed in this ear, and disbalance become worse. Without that I could probably live with fermentopathy for some time more, as it seems that recently I managed to find a regimen that makes it bearable (still not sure that living with such a disease would worth it), but I am sure that the disease does constantly progress, so hardly I would want to live long anyway.
And partially I blame for that incident my fragile health due to the mentioned fermentopathy in a premorbid period, or due to other negative mutations.

I am 33 years old (in this month would be 34).
My mother will inherit my two-room apartment, for which I have fully paid the mortgage (I never worked outside of the home).

Someone I went to see - paid out of pocket despite being on benefits - to help me heal from years and years of abuse by the public mental health services. A year of pure hell followed. I got physically ill several times, became agoraphobic and confined to my home, most of my friends fucked off - either slipped away because I was too tormented to conversate, some of them ghosted me and just disappeared, one of my best friends started competing with me (the absolute worst instance would be when he randomly said ""you know that childlike light that you had and lost after therapy? I think I'm gaining that"") and then left when I reacted because ""I need peace and quiet right now and there isn't enough time to talk later"" (he was one of the few people I told about my plans to CTB). My apartment used to be clean and quiet on the mind, now it's a disgusting mess. My clothes don't fit anymore because I relapsed into my eating disorder and lost a lot of weight.

A year ago I made my first serious suicide attempt. It wasn't very planned, nor very intelligent. I tried to OD on my anxiolytics, which likely wouldn't have worked any way but I was desperate. SI kicked in, I called an ambulance. Got to drink activated charcoal, took a couple of blood tests and then ran away from the emergency room because I was afraid of being involuntary admitted. I wish I had died. When you die of suicide in my country, they perform a psychiatric autopsy to try to get to the source of what led to the suicide.

You really get just tired of trying to ""fix"" things. My conclusion is really that I don't want to fix things anylonger but to just end things. It takes less energy and the thought of no longer existing is comforting.

The though of transitioning from life to dead feels a positive outcome.",2594065,,,,,,,

It's 125g (97% pure) for about $120. After shipping, taxes, and ""hazard"" fees, it's $220. What have you guys paid or been quoted?

Also, if anyone is willing to share their source that ships to residential US, I'd really appreciate a DM. I had a failed suffocation attempt years ago. I was really set on buying a shotgun this time (even took a handling class because I never used one), but then I discovered SN by reading PPH, and I would really prefer SN. I can't fail again.

Anyone who has a job is weak and miserable and lying to themselves. No exceptions. Their life is not worth living objectively.
The only reason people are against suicide is because they are too brainwashed and dumb to understand that life is bad. That's the only reason. No one could ever be smart and free-thinking and also choose life.
It's not worth it to live past [certain age]: something like in the mid 20s, lol.

I get that the site itself doesn't encourage suicide, but certain people definitely do. I'm fine with venting, but people will state the above opinions as objective truth that no one could possibly see differently.

im a shitty autist student from canada who is about to go through my 4th year of schooling. ever since the 3rd year, the repetition and the constant fuckery makes me so tired to the point where i just want to fucking sleep and never wake up.

-autism (high functioning) that makes me look like a loser who cant read facial expressions
-loneliness (shitty friends and no siblings)
-mass rejection by two women who i have loved (my reputation has been ruined due to this) which makes me scared that i won't have a partner in the future

as of right now, i am currently on summer vacation, so my mental has definitely improved, but its sure as shit that time flies by real soon so i won't have a fucking second to enjoy my shit.

now if my 4th year goes really bad and my grades flunk (uni's look at these grades carefully), i plan on ctb'ing via SN

however, the only reason that makes me actually discouraged from my plan is the fact how i feel bad for my mom

she has had 4 miscarriages and she has told me over and over again that i am a miracle.

although her mental isn't all there due to personal reasons, i still love her to death and i feel like i'd scar her if i leave her.

anyways, to all my fellow sasu people, do you guys have anything related that you'd like to share; anything that is potentially stopping you from ctb'ing?



thx for stopping and reading a random's little post. i love u guys!",,,,,,,,

,2598107,syrup ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ,"Jul 16, 2024 at 5:24 AM","I want to say I empathize greatly with your circumstances, trapped in a dilemma where the future nor the escape from it seems desirable. My parents fought a lot and I hated them for it, but I love my dear mother and I wouldn't be here if not for her. I can't fully comprehend your situation, but I want to try and make a few suggestions/ inquiries to you.

I want to ask you for the possibility of whether there is something more to the only reason why you haven't ctb'd. Anything that you remotely (and potentially wrongfully) suspect would bring you hope one day?

My readings might not be up-to-date, but loneliness is the pain that is evolved in all gregarious animals as punishment for not being 'gregarious', as that is the survival strategy our biology has adopted. However, if you live anywhere marginally urban, you will realize that your bond to your community has fundamentally become non essential to your survival, and thus this emotion is allowed to manifest as a deviation towards hopelessness from the purpose of why it was evolved. An alcoholic acquaintance of mine works on the logistics of a trading business, with a work hour of about 50 per week. He often complains about the dull working environment (he sends emails all day, everyday) and just the absolute tedious amount of work, yet his steam profile states he plays about 110 hours of counter strike per two weeks. The point here is he has no survival drive to make amends, there is no need for him to socialize, if he is hungry he can just use uber eats. This, my friend, is my personal experience on why adult life often becomes lonely and repetitive as you might fear so much, all of my friends are like this.

The future sounds shit because we are bound by menial tasks, but the deviation towards degeneracy suggests a possible deviation towards rectitude. It is easier said than done, but if you can understand that your brain's punishment imposed on you for making shitty friends and being rejected by pretty girls is nothing compared to your authentic self, there really isn't much else to do other than the pursuit of it. An example to highlight would be Bukowski (who also had shit friends and often rejected by girls), who wanted to be a writer in his early twenties but faced repeated rejections from publishers, forced to drift between menial jobs (postman, driver, etc.) and only finding a following in his late forties. For a man who tried his whole life, you will find the mantra 'Don't Try' on his gravestone, as in, do not try to push your life towards unimportance and unfulfillment.

You are very young and your concern for your mother shows you have a very kind heart, I also imagine your life with high functioning autism to be exponentially more challenging than mine. However, and I say this because you did not mention any interests, I question whether you have lived your life a bit too selflessly? If I ask you to write down the top two things you care about, you might rightfully list your mother as one of them. I would hope the other would be infinitely more selfish, something you would put above anyone else, something that allows you to see these menial tasks as a means to an end, as it is your life and you should. If you cannot come up with any meaningful ambitions, I do think it might be in your best interest to dedicate the majority of your free time in the near future in this process of trial and error, so as to be sure to not be regretful when you sentence yourself to death. I will, of course, try my best to understand and support your final verdict.

At last, as someone who dropped out of university as part of their plan to ctb and later found something deemed meaningful to do, I must tell you that, at least in my country, most institutions use the college certificate itself almost as part of a procedure, a 'passport' of some sort. That is, for most jobs it is probably okay even if you have absolute dog shit grades.",,,,,,,,

My reasons:

• In case I do die but have imperfect aim it will be very painful process. SN causes only slight discomfort.
• With a gun it's very gory and messy. I want to make it easy for people who will find and manage my corpse.
• Guns are not accesible for me personally. I would need to go through long process of obtaining a license, I find it too much of a work. SN is relatively easy to get.
• Owning a gun is out of my persona and would look suspicious. I can obtain SN secretively and hide it without feeling too stressed about it.
• Passing out feels more peaceful to me rather than putting a gun to my head and imagining how it will splash pieces of flesh all around the place.

I believe in death with dignity and it's so sad that we have to resort to such avenues to eliminate pain and suffering.

,1339975,LastLoveLetter,"Sep 23, 2021 at 6:48 PM","A recurring theme I have seen on this forum is persistent and profound loneliness. There are many members who have no companionship or connections in their lives at all, always alone and isolated. Others may have some relationships in their lives, but still feel alienated or neglected.

Some have shared that their seclusion has directly caused their suicidality. Some have stated that loneliness exacerbates it. Being suicidal is in itself often a lonely experience, resulting in ostracism and struggling to find understanding. I truly feel that SS is an important lifeline for us. I have encountered nowhere else we can discuss suicidality, systemic exclusion and social rejection so candidly.

The palpable desolation and soul crushing despair that many of us feel is unfathomable to those with healthy, loving support networks. I often find personally that people do not understand that going out and cultivating these connections is not always possible.

As such, I decided to create a Megathread for this subject. The aim is for those who are lonely in life to have a space where they can vent their frustrations, discuss their positions with others in a similar situation and support each other - perhaps even connecting with one another in the process (and becoming a little less lonely as a result).

You can post as much or as little as you like. I will always try my best to check in regularly, both to share and to respond to others.

I'll start by saying that I have always found it difficult to create and subsequently maintain connections, and have long suspected that I am autistic. I have no family and no friends. I am fortunate to have a boyfriend. Although I truly appreciate him, due to the the extent of my illnesses I feel very alone in the world, especially since my symptoms are routinely dismissed and undermined by peers and professionals alike. I often feel like such a burden that it means we do not have a typical relationship, as it revolves around my limitations when we are together. I am awaiting the day he eventually leaves to pursue a balanced relationship, and I truthfully would not blame him if he chooses to separate. I cannot even fulfill his needs romantically due to my illnesses and Complex PTSD, and the guilt of that crushes me.

I spend most of my life housebound, and a large proportion of it bedbound. SS is the only thing I have resembling a social network.

My hope for this thread is that some of us may find even a little bit of solace and solidarity from each other.

Staff will monitor this thread to ensure it stays on topic and is a safe, supportive space for those who participate.",,,,,,,,

,1340044,littlelungs,"Sep 23, 2021 at 9:35 PM","I'm likewise chronically ill, way too many problems to list here, but I've mentioned the lot of them a few times around this forum. Being chronically ill in my case means (among many others) extreme isolation, because any sensory stimulation or physical activity leads to permanent worsening and thus further suffering that I cannot afford. I'm housebound and mostly bedbound, spending most of my days in a dark room with earplugs in. I rarely speak because, again, permanent worsening, so I mainly communicate over text. I've tried to make friends online a couple of times, but because I can't speak and I can't always reply in a timely manner, it never works out. Also, most people just don't understand what it means to be chronically ill and its implications and consequences, and while I'm glad on the one hand that they don't have the experience to understand that, it just means further social isolation.

The social isolation in and of itself isn't what bothers me or makes me feel lonely (I've always been introverted and have preferred to keep my circle small, even before I became severely physically ill, and I'm very wary of other people and their intentions, which I don't think is unreasonable); rather it's the fact that I rarely feel heard by most other people, and had to fight for so long just to get someone to listen when it really mattered. The only person who truly understands IRL is my husband (likewise severely chronically ill) and to a large extent my mom (who always tries to understand), and at this point I just don't have it in me anymore to constantly explain myself and my situation to people who clearly don't even care to begin with, and I often badly struggle to put my thoughts and experiences into words, anyway, which is probably already apparent in this post. My reality is (and almost always has been) just too far-off from what most other people can really fathom, and because of this, the more people I'm around, the lonelier I feel.

I don't feel human and I feel as if I wasn't meant to be in this world.

Trauma is very alienating and, needless to say, it has aggravated my loneliness; normal people can't understand my experiences and I can't understand their experiences. When one of my few loved ones was dying of a terminal illness, the world continued to move on as if nothing was happening—I absolutely loathed the fact that people were still enjoying their lives while my own world was falling apart.

i also have the constant feeling that being alone is the safest thing one can do to not hurt others and theirself, until death takes them out. it's scary to hurt others, even if you don't mean to , even if they aren't aware of it.

The feeling of not having a gf has been causing me an average of perhaps 5 minutes of mild to moderate emotional pain per day for the past 5 years or so. Now, that's the estimated average; if I were to map it out, the pain would be made up of a few days a week with intense but short ""tfw no gf"" and a few episodes a month of intense and prolonged crying/fetal position/weird moments/silent screaming/laughing. And there are of course daily small instances of pain that I don't really count since they are not enough to cause any impairment. E.g: walking past a woman, going to the gym and having women be there, etc.

,1340194,OrcWitch,"Sep 24, 2021 at 4:23 AM","I think I was born to be lonely. I was born to a vulnerable narcissistic mother and a robot father. They were both emotionally incapable of giving affection, and the only adult who gave me affection was my grandpa. I grew up as a latchkey kid, cooking myself meals and raising myself. By age 9 I noticed that other children's parents paid more attention to them. My dad worked and shut himself in a room in the basement, my mom locked herself in the master bedroom and you had to walk on eggshells not to make her explode.

In early grade school I was ""that kid"" who smelled like shit, because my parents didn't do anything to have a pleasant smelling child. A few times my mom blew up out of nowhere and screamed at me for smelling bad, in retrospect I believe this is because another adult called her out on it and I was a source of making her look bad. It made me alienated and the weird kid. It wasn't until 4th grade I developed the maturity to ensure I smelled fine.

In middle school my few friends abandoned me. That sounds melodramatic but I had 3 best friends. They all became too cool to be seen with me, and became the three musketeers without me. Once they invited me to the dance and encouraged me to come with, then when I went with them they told me to go away and that they didn't want me around them. In retrospect they kept me around as the punching bag, and I basically hungout with them to be bullied by them. I basically shut down and didn't talk to anyone, and I got into mmorpgs and online forums.

My parents got divorced because my mom was an unstable psycho, and I started living with my dad and grandpa. My second day living with them they sat me down and yelled at me for being overweight, then my dad put rotting molding salad mix on a plate and made me eat it, telling me I needed to start eating healthier. Despite this my grandpa basically forced fast food on me everyday. He started molesting me in the morning when he got me up for school. I played world of warcraft and used 4chan and thought about committing suicide all the time. I stopped brushing my teeth or taking care of myself at all really. I dropped out of highschool and got my GED. I lost all my weight and became skinny when I started working and feeding myself, and emotionally coping with marijuana and alcohol and tobacco instead of food. I have not been overweight since.

On my 19th birthday my mom sent me an email apologizing for moving away, and saying she loved me and had been a horrible mother to me. She convinced me to move to her 6 months later. That went well for a few months until she started getting mad at me for working a fastfood job and sleeping on her couch. She stole my money a few times, then acted like the victim when I got upset. She screamed at me for crying on my 20th birthday because she perceived it as an attack on her. She kicked me out that December, and I had to sleep on the floor of my manager's apartment. I got an air mattress soon and built a comfy life at his house, and his wife felt sorry for me. But they were opiate addicts and always extorting money from me, so it was very hard to save to get an apartment. I was young and immature, and did a botched attempt at killing myself while living with them by trying to overdose laying in the snow in the woods. Instead I just vomited like crazy, went home and laid in the bathtub for 3 hours.

Eventually I moved in with an older woman who was looking for a roommate, she was in her early 30s and I was about to turn 21. I couldn't find a friend or boyfriend. My sister said she would go to my 21st birthday, but instead she went out to some costume party thing. My mom sent me pictures of my sister out having fun that night. I invited 5 people from work and they all stood me up, and I drank alone at a bar then went home. It was after that point I gave up on being outgoing, and I found it more comfortable to just sit on the computer than to risk rejection.

I eventually found me savior relationship but it turned physically abusive eventually. One evening my abuser gave me a concussion by hitting me in the back of the head while I had my back turned, and I already had a bruised cheek and eye from the previous few days. I am in therapy for some of the violence I put up with during it and was diagnosed with PTSD.I also have gone no contact with my mom and sister, as they have both treated me poorly. I have not had another real life relationship since then.

I got a job where a girl at work started to be my friend. I even took a bus to a mall with her and we went shopping and got lunch together. At work one day I was within ear shot(people speak very loudly), she was talking about going out drinking with 2 other girls from work that weekend. This girl who was trying to be my friend threw in a suggestion they invite me, and the other girl gave this sarcastic ""uh... yeah we'll see about that...."" response. I tried to act worldly and like I was too high iq to feel anything about it, but I cried pretty hard in my bed once I got home. I moved away and did not bother keeping contact with her.

I made a real life friend in 2020 and I spent a lot of time with her, and she was nice to me. She found a relationship and moved away, and I am back to being alone. I have discord friends and they are what keeps me sane. Sometimes I think I am more grown up and less affected by my isolation, I do not cry very often and feel mellow most of the time. but I am in a discord server of mostly females. I saw them talking about going out partying and having boyfriends and it made me cry the other night, I rarely cry but felt this huge wave of jealousy.

I am turning 29 in a few months and I have never lived. I have a tremendous lump in my throat writing any of this. I feel like I was born to have this failure of a life. Legitimately the only reason I do not kill myself is holding out for the day I have friends and a job and a marriage, and I am not alone. I go to college and I comfort myself in bed at night by playing these little movie clips in my head of the things I would do as a person in a relationship. I want to die because I am losing confidence of this ever coming true. I don't know why I had to be born.",,,,,,,,

Loneliness is also one of my main struggles.

I've been hurt many times by other people in the past so I am afraid to make friendships or socialise, even online. Besides that my avpd keeps me from any social interactions irl and it also sometimes affects me online as well.

In groups for example I am always the one who gets left out, in real life but also online. I feel like I never fit in anywhere.

All my life long I have been trying to overcome my social anxiety but everytime I did I was always left and forgotten. It hurts like hell when you are always the one person everyone cares the least about.

I've never had any relationship and the last time I had friends was back in 5th grade. Before that, my life was pretty normal but after that was when all the bullying and getting abandoned by ""friends"" started.

I still kept trying and trying to fit in but it made everything worse and worse.

I don't want to get hurt anymore.
A part of me still hopes that maybe one day I will find someone who understands me. Because this loneliness hurts.

But the most part of me has already lost all hope.

I've been lonely my entire life but ever since I did my transition, I haven't really had any romantic or sexual experiences anymore and it's a very important reason as to why I regret transition to a certain extend. Sure, I feel a lot more comfortable in my body now but at what cost? I've completely killed my social life and any perspective to ever have a fulfilling relationship ever again. According to studies, only close to 2% of the general (heteronormative) population is willing to date us. What does that mean? The chances of people actually being into you (despite being trans) are very slim. And most people that are ready to have sexual intercourse with trans people only do so because they get a huge kick out of that. As sad as it is, we are just a kink for many people and nothing more, thanks to the porn industry that lumps transgender people and ""shemales"" together and portrays us as sexual deviants that only wait to have our dicks sucked. You know it's true when the first question of most people expressing interest into you is about your genitals. And this image that's out there now thanks to the porn industry couldn't be further from the truth but we have to deal with this fantasy of other people on daily base. We have to serve as the outlet of the depraved fantasies of other men. This unhealthy bias affects mostly trans women, as far as I know. I don't know why, but guys think it's super hot if a woman has a dick - which isn't the problem. The problem is when we're solely reduced to our genitals and that's the case very often. I want to be seen as an individual with feelings and desires and not as a cock attached to a female body. I'm more than just ""trans"". Anyway, here is the link to said study.

,1340345,littlelungs,"Sep 24, 2021 at 10:15 AM","Aw, thank you. I'm glad that my posts are at least somewhat intelligible to other people, haha. That eases my mind a bit.

People just generally give me anxiety and I'm admittedly very sensitive to rejection when I *do* put myself out there, and I always feel like no matter what I say, it's stupid and nobody wants to hear it... which could very well be true, but that doesn't mean it doesn't feel bad and that the mere thought of people judging me doesn't nag away at me while I'm writing up a post. There have been quite a few times where I've wanted to participate in a discussion but felt like everything I was saying was all wrong, or I just couldn't get the thoughts out at all. Again, I just have a really difficult time expressing myself between the brain fog, invalidation, trauma, anxiety etc, and the fact that I often feel like words are simply inadequate.

As for not being completely bitter... I'm not gonna lie, it's hard not to be, but more than anything, I'm just so fucking tired. This life has beaten me to a pulp and I take solace in the fact that every passing day is one day closer to finally getting some actual god damn rest.

And at the risk of sounding like a self-righteous prick (here I go again with the disclaimers), I think a good part of why I try to show as much empathy and compassion towards others as I possibly can, is because I know how awful it feels to constantly be treated like absolute garbage and the kind of long-term consequences that it can have on a person, and I just want to (at least) be one less asshole in their life – and I think this is the case for a lot of others as well. It's also just always been important to me that other people feel welcome and included, so whenever I see someone who's lonely (and doesn't want to be) I just feel for them so much. It truly breaks my heart to read all of these posts, and I admit I shed a few tears because of it.

What if you are practicing, accidentally pass out, and then someone ""saves"" you after your brain and other organs have been irreversibly damaged from lack of oxygen, but you aren't actually dead yet? This is more likely to happen if the event doesn't take place at the appropriate scheduled time and place.

You also wouldn't have had a chance to leave a note, or the timing could also just be problematic in a number of other ways. You could end up traumatizing a family member unintentionally, for example.

There are certainly risks involved; but they are also specific ways of 'testing' setups that work by the person holding the other end of the rope, so if they pass out, the tension is released. Obviously this should be done safely where you won't fall and crack your head open when you go limp.

I can understand people wanting to do 'dress rehearsals,' though. People want to have as much assurance about the reliability of their technique as possible; of course, nothing is ever 100% reliable.

People are also skeptical about the whether the technique is indeed ""painless,"" they don't want to feel like they're being strangulated, so they may be trying to gauge their level of physical discomfort before trying the method.

On the other hand, some people may unconsciously wish for their attempt to fail from the outset, maybe they purposely sabotage some detail before proceeding, in which case, their wish may be for something other than immediate death. That is another matter.",2578909,2578922,,,,,,

I've decided to use full suspension as my CTB method, but I had one question that I was hoping somebody more knowledgeable/with more experience could answer:

Is there a way to reduce compressing your trachea/windpipe? After some research some people have said to use folded up socks/some type of cushioning around the carotids, is this effective? Or does it vary from person-to-person? For reference I haven't done my own testing yet but plan to soon

Also I'm not sure if I've found my ""sweet spot"" for compressing the carotids yet but again I'll be doing my own testing soon

I don't want to be lonely anymore I want to feel connection I just want someone in my life who knows me cares for me and I can speak with them without fear. Im constantly afraid to speak to people wrong I can never share my true emotions can never reveal who I am as a person. Every try to make friends or connections it always fails and now thinking about it I'm the issue cause I'm the common denominator in every failed connection I had. I hate myself I want someone to love me so I can feel something. I listen to fking gay asmr cause it makes me feel as if someone is close to me. I just want someone who would ever be excited to see me but this never happened. How come in every relationship I'm in I text people in under a second no matter how busy or how I'm doing mentally yet I can wait 10 hours for someone.

And I hate the idea that all my thoughts and feelings have no weight like I'm only this cause I'm a man and or cause I'm only 18 I don't care let me feel something I am surrounded by people but none of them I can form a connection I am constantly afraid to tell people anything in my life I am always so lonely. I just want to be with someone anyone I don't care if romantic or friend just I want someone who can validate my emotions instead of gaslight me into believing I'm the mistake for every depressing emotion I have ever felt in my life.

My family LOVES to tell me it's my fault because I'm not religious enough or whatever the fuck but I don't care. I am trying so hard to improve I think about every situation I've been in and try to reason out what I do wrong but it's never enough I'm such a failure. It hurts to be so lonely and now I feel like such a loser because my issue is loss of connection while people are dying. I don't deserve sympathy I am a loss of space air energy I wish I was never born I hate existence. I hate how my mind tricks me into happiness for a week then I will feel emptiness for months just to pretend I was over dramatic when that one good week comes back again.

I hate myself so much. I am the worst thing in existence. I remember talking to someone telling them that I definitely make their life worse whenever they talk to me. They told me ""don't overestimate your significance of your life to me."" That person is my best friend. I don't think I'll ever forget that because it shows that not just I am a burden but I am so irrelevant I can't even be annoying enough for a person to acknowledge me.

I've been lurking here & once I found out I couldn't OD on what I had, I found out about SN & put all my eggs in that basket. I ordered & received in a time frame when I thought I would be homeless. I've extended living with my ex & it is abusive & horrific & I just want to CTB. He is not the sole reason. It doesn't help though. So I planned to CTB the second I received & then I found out about AE & all this other stuff. And I've demeaned myself begging for help on here & it has varied wildly from generous to scammers & it's hard for a newbie tech illiterate to know the diff. And then life circumstances intervened in my CTB plan. And I let them. I've learnt nothing - people pleasing is a disgusting trait & if you have it, go get help. At a time when I need to put myself first I'm still last. Every time, I promise myself next time will be different, I'll put myself first. When everything calms down, when everyone else is ok, all of it. But I've been physically & sexually assaulted, I've lost nearly all my family members to death (still not getting a look in for a simple are you ok, how can I help…?
Just more abuse that I've accepted because I'm broken & my decision is already made anyway. But then, I didn't have the time to research & I can't afford to fuck it up. My ex that I'm still living with is constantly going through my physical & digital things - I can't tell you what I've hidden & where. And them my living situation, although horrific, meant I thought I could suffer it out here while I researched. Buy myself some time. And then it looked like there was a minor inheritance coming my way - I'm past flat broke & in debt through my eyeballs - it bought me some time with the ex because he thinks he deserves it… And so I tried to research. And thought the money was gonna come my way quickly & I could afford to go stay at a nice hotel to see out my last days. But the money is still tied up & I can't get an answer on that. I need to hock my wedding ring & I don't know how to get proper money for it - it's my only asset. And then I finally got some time to research & the fucking ex suddenly starts working from home - he knew something… And then, I'm shocked to learn this, I bought the BS that you have to wait a certain time to report someone missing - I had a perfect opportunity, or so I thought, & the plan was a really good lie about why I was off grid, go to a fancy rural cabin style hotel & enjoy a full day of last meals & books & tv shows & just chilling. And then fasting, doing the protocol, taking my time, not being found, all of that. I DID NOT KNOW that where I am, you can report someone missing after literally 20 minutes. FFS. My ex won't do that from concern, there'll be punishment involved. I thought I'd have time, chill, breathe, not rush, savour the alone time, prepare, get it right & go. But he'll destroy that in a second which ramps up the pressure. And then the fucking conflicting advice on here - I have nowhere else to go for help - I take 400 quietapine daily, I used to take 800. I have a high tolerance & I do not sleep. And I saw in Stan's & the bible that you can use it as AE. But I dint understand what the nM stuff means. And I have expired procleramide or whatever it is, but can't find out if still useful. But it was prescribed for seasickness & the guides say that's a no go. So I thought I might break my integrity & lie to an online doc about needing meto but the interaction checker says that's a no go. And I can't find out if that just means if you plan to live or not. So I wanted to go immediately, put off for a bunch of crap reasons & a bunch of legitimate reasons - I really thought I could have 24 -48 hours in a hotel & just do this well & PEACEFULLY & successfully. But it's getting further away & I can't have that. The abuse has ramped up. I can't take it. And I don't want any advice on shelters & how to escape, he's A reason, not the only reason. But what the fuck do I do now?? Knowing he can report me missing immediately. Knowing that meto & seroquel interact? Not knowing if seroquel is sufficient AE? Not knowing if my expired procleramide or whatever is any good??? It seems like the difference between success & failure is planning, AE & not being found. BUT I NEED TO GO. I can't take it anymore. In a lifetime of taking it, it's my time, I have to go. I just have to. Does anyone know if I can use quitapine as AE, even as long term ""user""? If the AE I have will work, even though it's for travel sickness & years out of date? What to use instead of meto if it interacts so badly? How to read drug interaction checkers when they're designed for people who want to survive. I can give up the fancy hotel, I can give up the one day of me time that I really thought I deserved, all of it. But I have to go. I. Just. Can't. Take. It. Anymore. But. I. Can't. Afford. To. Get. It. Wrong. Please help me, please help me, please help me. I'm not a time waster, I'm not looking for sympathy or another way out. Just help to succeed. He's going through my stuff. I only have my goddamn phone. I don't have the luxury to do a better job by myself. I would if I could but I can't. The desperation is sickening. And I haven't tested my SN yet because I don't want to expose it or have him find it - he can't find it right now, I'm pretty sure. But if it's fake, I'm fucked. I'm fucked anyway. After tonight's abuse, I can't wait for anything else to be posted. I can't take anymore. I thought I could. But I just can't. FFS. ALL I DO IS RAMBLE HERE & LINGER LONGER. I don't want to ramble or linger longer. Faaarrrrkk. Please help me. Please. I hate this & I need to go.",,,,,,,,

And I used to take 800 & I've taken it for a long time. And it interacts with meto but I don't know if that's just for if you plan on living.

I'll pop one out soon to see if it's chalky or falling apart or smelly or whatever else they said. So I guess I'm giving up on the meto option. But the Prochlorperazine maleate was prescribed to me years ago for seasickness by the same doctor that prescribes my quetiapine. I'd been on it for years before I started this doc, they just continued to prescribe it & has gotten me to reduce my dose gradually for years. This doc is the real deal, the best I've ever met, actually saved my life when I had a thyroid storm. They told me how they diagnosed so quickly & how it would've been missed at a walk in clinic & probs at a hospital & I've asked every doc since, even ones in my personal life & they've all confirmed, without a doubt, if I'd presented to them, they would've missed it & that I would have likely died the next morning. All of them happy to admit it. So I guess I wonder why my doc would've prescribed the Prochlorperazine maleate in the first place when they're not a crappy prescription happy doc???

I can't open attachments though, my ex still has access to some of my iPhone stuff, as proven again yesterday… I use a VPN to go on here in private pages & have a secret email account. But as for the rest of it, I don't know what he can see. Even though I changed my Apple ID etc, he had secretly set it up so he could read both my regular email accounts - I had a hunch, but yesterday proof that he'd reattached himself to my gmail - I confronted him, it didn't go well. I'm going to have to accept he can see everything I do or go see an Apple genius about keystroke logging & all the stuff someone on SaSu told me about…. I don't know for sure if he can even see this but is happy about it - at this point, absolutely nothing surprises me, just saddens & disgusts me. But back to the meds, I'm going to read what I can today & tomorrow if I get the privacy & then write up a plan to post on here to see if anyone can see holes or can see obvious drug interactions & just general stuff I don't know because I just don't have the privacy to research l, it's not laziness. And it's hard with the drug interaction checkers, I only need to see how it will affect me over the course of the CTB process, (hopefully only a matter of hours or less, to when I'm unconscious) rather than if I planned on living & taking long term - so I guess anything that'd cause seizures or vomiting or counteract the effect of SN or cause pain immediately…. I dunno. There's so much to learn here. If I was living alone & had a desktop I could use, I would have the most detailed research in history. But an iPhone, a live in abusive, snooping ex & zero private time is just fucking this up so badly. It goes against my nature to ask for help, to not put in the hard yards myself, to take shortcuts, to be lazy & it actually really hurts to have to be that person at the hopefully end of my life. But I have to live in the circumstances I'm in, not the ones I want & so it is what it is. I feel like such an arsehole for asking questions that have answers right there on the internet - I feel stupid & useless & needy & desperate & I worry about the perception of laziness, all of it. And that's not helping. But I'm scared & I need help so here we are. All advice gratefully received. I literally don't know what all the icons on here do, on this box, at the top of SaSu, any of it & I'm too scared to touch any links - I haven't hit any of the spoiler buttons, any attachments, any links - EVEN THOUGH I WANT TO OR NEED TO - I just don't know what goes to the cloud, what goes to downloads or files or provides a trail he can see & after yesterdays proof I know he's still in my digital stuff & I'm terrified of how he'd use that information against me.

,2572373,DOHARDTHINGS24,"Jun 24, 2024 at 12:29 AM","Hi
This is long & I'm sorry but I'm desperate.
I need an idiot proof guide to getting this right…
My SN from DMC is supposed to arrive in the next 3 hours. The time has finally come to get ready to actually CTB - within the next few weeks.
I'm a broken record about this & I apologise but the basics are I'm still living with my ex spouse but that is to end shortly, I've been delaying & delaying because the SN took a lot longer than I thought & I needed the physical address. Which I now can't guarantee for any further deliveries so no new online purchases are possible.
He is a snoop in general but particularly a digital snoop & tech savvy. I have zero tech skills & am limited to an iPhone, & research limited to handwritten notes. No screen shots, no other websites for research, no big screen to search & read everything quickly.
And I have ADHD. And only very small windows of time to research.
And I only have one chance to CTB.
And if the SN arrives today, I ""should"" be able to drag it out here with random excuses, without worrying about actually having to move house or not have a roof above me which has been a legitimate concern.
But now I need to hurry up & move my plan forward, knowing the end is in sight.
And I've got a really good window coming up where I can tell both work & my ex why I'll be away for a few days or maybe even a week - it's been nearly impossible to have a matching story & now something has fallen into my lap that is just perfect.
I will be CTB'ing in a hotel room, in a room with an internally locked door, with a note for staff to call emergency services rather than trying to enter. I have limited money & was gonna do it somewhere cheap & nasty but have since rethought & decided to splash out somewhere nice - even though the debt will be left behind, my ex will still get my super, my wedding ring, all my belongings to hock - I earn very little but get a lot of freebies from work that are easily saleable. I am really trying to not put anyone out here.
But also, I guess now is also really the time to think about me.
My adhd wants me to procrastinate or focus on the wrong things like cleaning & organising the house (!! I'm not kidding!!) & my concentration is non-existent -just none - & I'm having a really big struggle.
The biggest struggle of my life TBH.
Plus I didn't completely believe the SN was actually coming & now it looks like it is.
So I have a bunch of problems that need sorting & would be thrilled with any advice.
Things that are easy for other people are really, really difficult for me - a combo of the phone, lack of time, money & tech skills, handwritten notes, physical health problems, adhd, no fixed address into the future & a traumatic brain injury that makes memory an issue for me.
It's a lot.
I know that I ""should"" be able to do this by myself & I've tried but I can't.
I really can't.
If I could, I would.
I'm not lazy, I am the hardest worker I know at my job & it's a big field. Working hard is in my blood - tough, strict farmer parents who taught me work ethic as a child.
But my work is within my skillset. And this is most definitely not.
And now I'm begging for the patience & mercy of strangers here to help me.
I really, really need it.
I'm a proud & independent person - it's not in my nature to ask for help, let alone beg. But it's where I'm at, so anyone that can help me fill in some blanks, please please do.
I am begging. I'm sorry.
My decision to CTB is final. It's been 3 decades in the making. But only a few months in the planning - I didn't know what I didn't know which is making me stress about how much I still don't know…
I can't see the holes in my plan.
I didn't know I couldn't just OD on prescription drugs in a bath - celebrities make that look easy, I guess.
I didn't know about SN, I didn't know about SaSu, protocols, nothing, anything. I've since learnt a little but not enough.
I have some specific questions plus also, if anyone can see holes in my plan that I can't see out of ignorance or lack of research, please point them out.
1 I live in Australia - I can buy some time where I can't be reached with work & ex but am unsure how long - I live near a state border - I didn't know if anyone reported me missing, would it be better to do it interstate to slow things down? Or is that not a thing? I haven't picked a hotel yet.
2 how much noise does dying from SN realistically make - again, I haven't picked the hotel yet - I don't want anyone to overhear & call for help - I've seen varying reports from people about the amount of noise & I definitely need to take that into account when I book somewhere.
3 the SN testing - it's impossible for me to get 2 x 1 litre bottles of distilled water but I did just get a 2 litre bottle - I haven't fully read how to test - can I use the one 2 litre bottle or should I get a second - I can't remember if there was a reason for single litre bottles or if that's just what's most common elsewhere.
4 more SN testing - I can't get the Exit test nearby or get any more deliveries but there's a pet store near me with aquarium tests. I ""think"" Stan's bible said 10mg/l or something like that?? I bought a test on impulse that I can return but didn't want to linger in the store - API test strips 5 in one. They had others in API & Aqua drop & maybe Tetra brands but I ""think"" they only went to 5mg/l maybe?? Does anyone know of an approved test for SN in any of those brands???
And is the testing difficult to do? I'm beyond shit at math & practical stuff. Just stupid at things that make sense to other people. I need everything dumbed down - I don't care if you sound patronising with instructions. Feel free to talk to me as ignorant. I'd rather that, TBH.
5 antiemetics - all I have at the moment is 25 tablets of prochlorperazine maleate 5mg that expired in 2021 - are they of any use? How many would I need? I don't know if they're any good or not - with no guaranteed address, I can't get meto delivered & I will not lie to my regular doctor & I'm hoping these are good enough ??? Plus I saw mention of seroquel which I have a lot of, but have been taking 400 a night for years & used to take up to 800. Taken for decades. Does that mean it's already working for me? Or that it won't work at all because I've taken for so long?
6) antacids - I saw a lot of brand names & stuff but not anything I recognised. Does anyone know the name of the active ingredient, the strength & how many I need & then I can just find at my local chemist???
Or the right one to get in Australia?
7 sedatives & painkilllers - I have access to a fairly large amount of temazepam & diazepam but don't know the right amount - I'm a woman in my late 40's weighing about 53 kilos. But I've taken 2 temazepam every night for a really long time & normally half a diazepam as well. Is it the more the merrier? Or will too much make me vomit? Will too little keep me concious too long? Plus I have about 60 panadeine forte tablets which are a paracetamol/codeine combo - 500mg paracetamol & 30mg of codeine phosphate hemihydrate 30mg. And a bunch of rizatriptan 10mg wafers that are migraine drugs - do they do anything???
8 other medication interactions - should I take any more of my current meds? Or should I stop some because they'll interact with SN or stop me from CTB'ing successfully - I take lamotrigine, Dex for ADHD, seroquel, the contraceptive pill, thyroid replacement, temazepam & diazepam. I also have the mentioned above but don't take at the moment & a bunch of Ritalin leftover that I took before the Dex but I thought avoiding the ADHD meds might be good because tachycardia might make me panic & call for help & fight against the sedatives???
9 tips for fighting SI - I plan to kill my iPhone & hotel room phone as soon as I am situated to decrease chances of trying to get help. But because SI is so natural & can't really be predicted, are there any tips for what to do in advance? Or at the time?
10 coming to terms with actually CTB - it's been 3 decades in the making, the decision is final, but now that the SN is coming, it's moving from a concept to reality. And because I've thought about this for so so long, how to make that mental shift, how to adjust that it's actually happening??
11 the fear - even though it's what I want, I'm scared. Partly that I'll fuck it up, partly of actually going through with it. I can't explain wanting something & being scared of it at the same time…
12 the seizures - I don't understand how they're caused, if you can prevent, if they're painful, anything about it. I started lamotrigjne this year but am still on a low dose - 50 in morning & 50 at night. Would that help in any way? Should I take more?
I need to know what to expect in terms of seizures. And if they can be prevented. And if it's painful. And if it's loud - if it's loud enough for people to hear in the next hotel room, if I should go to a caravan park cabin instead to get more space? Or if it's loud, is there a way to quieten it down? And is it seizures that are painful? Or the SN? Is any of it scary? Is any of it peaceful?
13 the protocol - based on what I have now, assuming it's not likely I'll get meto, what should I do - considering my age & weight but also with my history of all the meds above, what to do about the antiemetics - are the ones I have useful, how many temazepam & diazepam & antacids & painkillers & over what time frame & any meds to stop because of interactions.
I need this plan to be idiot proof. I'm the idiot. I can't afford to fuck this up in any way.
I have to do this once & succeed.
There is no back up plan.
Are there obvious things that I'm overlooking?
Are there obvious differences between successful & unsuccessful attempts with SN?
Can you drink any alcohol at all? Or does that make it worse?
Is making up the SN drink difficult in any way? Again, maths & practicality & research is difficult for me. My weight goes between about 51 - 53 kilos but no more variation than that.
If my SN is legit & I follow a protocol -either whatever I can find on here or if someone with the knowledge & kindness can help tailor to me & my meds, how long til I'm unconscious & is there any way to speed that up without vomiting. I want as little as time as possible between taking & passing out because of the unknowns of SI.
I know I'm ""new-ish"" on here but I lurked for a very long time because it took me ages, an embarrassing amount of ages, to set up a VPN & find my IP address & set up a SaSu account from a blocked country.
Just. No. Skills.
And I haven't written a lot of public messages, although I have sent quite a few private ones. I didn't come here to make friends or post random stuff which might make me selfish- I came here because I am desperate for help to do something I can't do by myself. Some things are just harder for me & I really apologise for that. But I can't ask anyone IRL & I don't know where else to go.
am desperate. I am begging.
Please, if anyone has even a single word of advice, please pass it on.
On this post.
In private.
As much or as little as you know.
As much or as little as you're comfortable sharing.
Even it's fucking obvious to an idiot. My memory just doesn't retain because of ADHD & TBI - those are facts rather than excuses. Maybe the rest of the above are excuses. I don't know. If I had known there was going to be such a time crunch involved…
But now is the time.
I beg of all, please, please help me help myself to do the one thing I need to do but don't know how.
Pass on my message to anyone you think can help. Anyone with pharmacological knowledge. A doctor. Someone who knows people that have succeeded with SN & how they made it work. People who have failed attempts & know where they went wrong. I'm so far beyond worried this long post full of dumb questions will be ignored.
That people won't read.
That people will think I should be able to do this by myself.
That I'm stupid. Or greedy. Or lazy.
Please be kind & respond.
If you can help, please help. If you know someone, please ask their help for me.
It shames me to beg but I can't do this alone.
Please help.",,,,,,,,

,2572725,N3UR0T1C,"Jun 24, 2024 at 8:10 AM","1. I do not live in Australia so this question is a bit difficult for me to answer, generally though missing person reports on adults take quite a long time to even begin to investigate.

2. It makes a moderate amount of noise, but you can mitigate it. You may potentially vomit at some point, and you will likely seize. If you want to avoid loud noises, I would suggest laying yourself on the ground in the recovery position (on your side, face pointed towards the ground to avoid aspiration) to avoid the sound of you falling out of a chair or bed if the seizures are severe.

3 and 4. I do not have much experience with actually testing SN samples, but the instructions on the test should be pretty clear. If you got your stuff from DMC, it is very likely to be pure, so I wouldn't concern yourself too much if you cannot figure out the testing.

5. Your antiemetic isn't the top choice, but it does have significant D2 activity which is the most important part of SN antiemetics. The drug strength is still likely intact for the most part. I'm not familiar with the dosing for the drug, but make sure to take enough to account for potential purity losses due to decomposition of the active ingredient.

6. Any kind of long-acting antacid combined with a short acting antacid on the day of will work. Sodium Bicarbonate for the short-acting, and I'm not sure what long-acting medications exist in Australia, but your chemist would probably know.

7. In terms of the sedative medications, I won't recommend a dosage but you should probably take a little more than what you would normally take to feel a strong sedative effect. In terms of the painkillers, take a minimal amount to knock out any headache or discomfort you might feel during the process. Don't bother with the migrane drugs. Also don't bother with the seroquel, it has the same underlying mechanism of action as the antiemetic plus a bunch of other random effects that could interfere with the process.

8. Discontinue all medications beyond the ones needed for the process.

9. The best way to kill SI is the aforementioned sedative medications.

10. I have no advice for frame of mind. It is your decision to make, if you feel it is right than you will make it.

11. Fear of the unknown is natural. If you're feeling discomfort day-to-day, you can always take some of your sedative medication, as you seem to have enough.

12. You can continue your anticonvulsants to potentially offset seizure risk, the sedatives will also counter it. The seizures with SN typically occur after the onset of unconsciousness, as the brain is oxygen starved and cells are dying. It shouldn't be painful for that reason.

13. Use the PPH Protocol for SN, it is somewhere in the suicide megathreads sticky. Replace the meto with the proper dosages of your chosen antiemetic, and take the sedatives and painkillers in the dosages you desire the day of an hour or two before SN ingestion.

14. I didn't notice anything you are overlooking

15. Unsuccessful attempts are rare unless you are discovered. If you are stopped or it does not succeed, you are extremely unlikely to end up with neurological damage.
16. Don't drink alcohol. It slows gastric emptying and increases your vomiting risk.

17. No, making the drink isn't difficult. Follow the dosing guide on the sticky, and dissolve it in around 50ml of water. If you aren't exact on the water, it really doesn't matter.
18. Unconsciousness times vary wildly, typically it is within 30 minutes to 2 hours. Not as familiar with this part, but there's a lot of resources here.

,2573557,DOHARDTHINGS24,"Jun 24, 2024 at 11:22 PM","Thank you so much for such a thorough & detailed response. I am truly overwhelmed with gratitude. My DMC delivery came yesterday & I got to it before my ex by sheer luck & a matter of seconds, stuffing inside my jumper. I have yet to open it as it is much easier to hide this way. I believe it to be from DMC & pure but would still like peace of mind of testing - I was approached by a number of very believable people on here who were so kind & helpful but turned out to be scams - it broke my heart that people would take advantage of someone as desperate as me, at all, but particularly as they seemed to genuinely care. So, better safe than sorry & will test. But because everyone is so confident of DMC & not wanting to open the package yet, that can wait a while.
Your comment on being on the floor in the recovery position is genius - definitely something I wouldn't have thought of - I'm sure I read a bunch of laying down & waiting, but the recovery position on the floor is spectacularly helpful.
To the point of discontinue use of other meds, how long prior to attempt do you mean? As in, that day, 2 days, longer??
And in terms of the antiemetic, I definitely can't get anything delivered & I won't implicate my normal doctor - should I be attempting to get meto from a random doctor? Or is it such a suspicious drug that you can only get from an ongoing doctor? I can potentially lie to an over the phone, dial a doctor / online request kinda thing, but probably not in person & definitely not to my doctor. Is there an easy way to get me to? Instead of dealing with the unknowns of my not ideal & expired current drug.
And regarding the temazepam & diazepam is there a minimum amount & would that change because I've taken for so long? Or is there a maximum amount before you start to vomit or whatever? Any tips on how not to vomit, other than the antiemetic, in terms of what to take & what to avoid? I don't want to just go to sleep, vomit safely, & wake up in 2 days time…..
I really appreciate the time & effort you've put into this & I hate to ask more of you, but this means more to me than you'll ever know.
Thank you so very much
Thank you so much for picking this up.
Do you have any further tips or advice?
I am beyond grateful for such generous advice.
But that doesn't mean I wouldn't be thrilled with more….
Particularly regarding the antiemtics, whether what I have is useful, how many to take etc.
Or if I defs need meto & is it possible to get from random unknown doctor?
And also, specifically regarding the temazepam & diazepam - regarding my long standing use of both, my age, my weight etc - is there a minimum amount to help knock me out? Is there a maximum amount that would make me start to vomit? Any tips on minimum or maximum of anything really - a 2 hour window sounds like a really, really long time - what can I do to speed it up without fucking it up…One shot.
There has been a very large incident today that I won't go into that is affecting my CTB window - it may make it much quicker, as in the next few days, or make it longer, as in a month. And I don't know which. I just know that it's really bad either way in terms of CTB plan, but also in terms of how the rest of my life before CTB'ing will play out. It is in the hands of others, very dramatic & very much outside of my control & very much making me worry that I'll forget or overlook things or have even less time to plan as I may get tied up in terms of these fucked up events. Or go quicker just to avoid. I'm begging for the empathy of strangers on here, because I'm sure as fuck not getting any support from the last remaining family members - my doc said people often choose a toxic tribe over no tribe, and that addicts brains are wired differently & if they're narcissists or whatever on top of that plus the level of entitlement… And to stop being shocked when the same people do the same things - I just always held out that there was still a shred of a human in there that could be reached, that we've been siblings for nearly 50 years, that that should count, but today proven there is no low they won't go to. I'm telling myself it's the addict in them, but honestly, what was left of my heart shattered today in a way I didn't think was still possible. Sorry, all beside the point, it's just been so awful. So awful.
Any advice, big or small, no matter how obvious to other people, I probably don't know what I need to know.
Any & all help needed desperately & appreciated beyond measure.

,2573595,Trav1989,"Jun 25, 2024 at 12:12 AM","To me it looks like you know what you are doing and have all your bases covered, I wish you luck on your journey. I am looking to do the same soon and am going to order SN relatively soon ( the beginning of next month) as a back up plan for if my legal troubles aren't sorted out.

I got an excellent lawyer that costed me nearly every dime I had or id have ordered SN earlier. I am also going through a divorce myself (a VERY messy one at that) where I stand to lose everything and if that happens I'm planning to CTB. I also have terminal health issues and am not long for this world anyways but I would prefer to go on my own terms and in my own home.

You seem to possess a lot of the things I lack though for certain.

Again, much luck to you, life is extremely rough and I can't blame you for going this route.

Another possibility other than a hotel room is to acquire a rental in a more rural area to CTB in like I recently did as a backup plan but I realize that this can cost a lot of money, I just wanted to make sure there is no possible way for ""help"" to arrive and plan on doing this in a full bathtub so as to drown after falling unconscious to mitigate convulsions.

Then again, drowning has always been the way I have wanted to go personally. As an avid swimmer from a young age I feel like it would just be fitting to CTB in such a manner.",,,,,,,,
,2573680,N3UR0T1C,"Jun 25, 2024 at 2:09 AM","1. Discontinue all medications not neccessary for short-term survival within 72 hours of sodium nitrite ingestion.

2. The antiemetic drug that you mentioned in your OP should work fine enough as a replacement for the meto if you can't get it. It has the same underlying mechanism of action.

3. I would take twice the dose you normally take if you've become tolerant to the benzos, but that's just a guess tbh. Getting an exact dosing on the benzos isn't important, they just help calm you down.

4. Just make sure you fast for at least 8 hours before to avoid vomiting. No alcohol as well. You likely won't vomit with the antiemetic you have on board, and even if you do, it will be long absorbed into your bloodstream.

For specific dosing requirements, I would go to the 2022 PPH stickyed in this forum, and scroll down to the SN section. It has detailed dosing instructions for the SN as well as antiemetics. The dosing regimen for your antiemetic and metocloperamide seem pretty similar.",2573557,,,,,,,

A dumb tech question though because of the digital snooping ex - I've managed to bookmark Stan's bible & such here to sit down & have a proper read.but yet to do. I'm slightly too young to get PPH from Exit. All the links I've seen on here are things that ""look like"" they need to be opened in some way - I'm too scared to open anything on my phone in the way of files or pdfs because of where they might go & what he may see & digital trails etc that could be used for blackmail or calling police or whatever. Are there any versions of PPH on here that are just pages on here that I can bookmark & read but not open in any way? No files, no pdfs, no adobe or any of the things - again, I don't know what I don't know - but if it's here anywhere as a page, I'd be grateful to help find it. Today has been one of the worst days of my life. In a not great life. I am in unfathomable pain. But you guys have been heaven sent. When I begged for help, this is what I wanted but didn't believe I'd get. I've only had the time today for a quick read & response but will read thoroughly again & take notes when I find time in the next few days.

And regarding police contact, there's absolutely nothing they can do if they get a report that you are reading the PPH. Just tell the police that you have no intention of harming yourself.

But……I'm also in Australia and very ready and very serious to make this happen so I wanted to reach out. I'm on the West Coast. Both being Australian, we may be in a similar boat. I've researched options for some time now.

My reasons centred on debilitating pain for many years, now. You don't have to do this alone because I want to do this, too. And I'm taking it seriously. I have done a will, but I need to re-do it because I have been anhused by some family members and I want to rest in peace knowing they won't be there.. I have ordered things online. I've tried and failed with a tank of air of some kind. I'm not sure what I'm allowed to say.

One piece of advice I would give is if you can treat this like a project. Have paperwork, make notes, and where possible take the emotion out. It's a serious topic and it needs to be executed as such. I even contacted an ex boyfriend hoping he'd have a contact for a hit man. I have ideas coming out of my eyeballs but I'm yet to make my own post with what I know. I am glad I found this forum. Very glad.",2572373,,,,,,,
,2583580,DOHARDTHINGS24,"Jul 3, 2024 at 6:36 AM","Thanks for your response. I'm sorry for what led you here. What led us all here. I am very much treating this like a project - the only reason I missed my own CTB ""dead""line was because I realised I didn't know enough & keep finding more things I don't know about. I hadn't heard of this site or SN or anything - but once I did I realised I had to put in the work. Plus the SN took a LOT LONGER than expected & then even though life circumstances have led me to my decision, there's also a few other life challenges / roadblocks that have popped up & need to be addressed. None of it good. My life is horrific & I keen & wail like an animal & I'm ready to go - but am not prepared enough. I have been very, very vocal about this - I want to CTB, the decision is made, it will not be unmade, I want it to be soon, it will definitely be this year, I would be thrilled if I could make it this month, I want one attempt only & to be successful. The desperation is scary because that's how you make mistakes. I bought a new will kit & power of attorney kit etc & will have it filled in with me at the hotel - I doubt it will be properly registered unfortunately - but all I want clear & will hand write with it - DNR.
In the time frame I'm dealing with, I can't get my separated husband removed from decision making or benefiting from my death - super etc - oh my golly, they refuse to make any decisions binding until a formal divorce & need to have CTB'd before I can legally get divorced & that sucks. But if I can really ram home the DNR & the people I DON'T WANT involved in decision making ""hopefully"" that will be enough from making it worse - as awful as my husband is, I have a family member that is worse & cannot have them involved. I don't plan to write a proper suicide note - just have the will kilt & medical power of attorney paperwork filled in, a note to say DNR, the date I decided to do this because that's important to me, & who I don't want involved - maybe even some form of evidence that I am estranged from the family member. That's about it. I am very scared about needing to do this quicker than I am ready, I'm scared that I'll fuck it up, I'm scared about everything I don't know. I will gratefully receive any advice from any person - I'm not here for sympathy or multiple attempts or long term friendships or anything else - no judgement on what brings other people here or to diminish their needs - just to be clear that I'm here because I need to be, I need to go soon & to be successful I need help. And some of the help has been overwhelming - I need it. Good luck with your journey - I'm probs not much help to you because I'm clueless & new too - I won't give out a DMC link - but if that is the route you take, I can give advice on time frames, payments, customs etc that are relevant to Australia - that is what I can help with if you need it - not the link, not anything to encourage you or discourage you - but I can help with AU logistics if you need it.
I'm a broken record on this too - if help will help, please get help. Otherwise, peace to you & the decisions you need to make.",2582145,,,,,,,

,2584607,DOHARDTHINGS24,"Jul 4, 2024 at 3:44 AM","Hey
I've got a bunch of stuff still to work out.
I have expired antiemetics & I don't know if they're any good & have yet to find out - I don't even know if they're the right ones anyway. I have 25 tablets of prochlorperazine maleate 5mg that expired in February 2021.
I'm not really sure how to find out if they're any good. Or how to get meto or another antiemetic if I need it - I can't have it delivered & won't involve my GP in this, that's not kind. So I guess I need to find out if what I have is useful. And how many. Or what lies I need to tell (which I'm really uncomfortable about), to an online or walkin kind of doctor - I read a post on here. I just need the time. I thought this would be the last week of zero time & that I could then sit down & really do this - write out what I still need to get, where to book a rural hotel, write out my plan & post on here to see if people can find holes. But my circumstances are sucking all my time & I really don't know how to get through the busy so I can focus on this project. And I still don't know how long I can stay at this address - I'm doing a tap dance here. And I'm literally on here a couple of minutes a day on an iPhone because of how things are. I really need to CTB, I need everything planned - I just don't know how to circumvent life to get to death. I can easily get a few days away to CTB but I can't get any time earlier to do proper planning. I've still gotta get antacids too. I went to the chemist & got overwhelmed & realised I need to research that more too. Plus, it looks like I might have to wait until I can get my next prescription of sedatives too. I dunno. I keep finding problems but lack the time to find solutions. I have to prioritise it - it's just shitty circumstances & health issues & money problems & a divorce & a perfect storm of shitness - things that aren't even related to my decision to do this in the first place. Sorry. Crappy rant.
I won't give out the DMC link but if that's the route you take, I can help with logistics & AUS stuff. If you get links, you could send them to me privately & I can confirm if that's who I used & the process. But as much as I was desperate to get a backup source, I haven't been able to find anyone I was confident enough about in the time frame I had at this address. I've not yet tested mine either but I'm confident - fingers crossed - that I've got the right stuff. But if you use another supplier or method, I don't know anything. I'm putting all my eggs in one basket here which is terrifying - I want a plan b & c & d. I want every box ticked. It's just not working out that way. And yes, I'm a middle aged woman if that helps or doesn't - I am worried that I've now shared too much on here & my husband or whoever I don't want to know about this - they might be able to identify me - I don't want to be paranoid but I'm worried I'm getting stupid. I never expected to post so much on here - I really thought I could join & easily (the tech stuff from a blocked country was too hard for me), someone would tell me immediately how to be successful with what I had on hand, I'd do it straight away. Dead within a week of finding this site. That was the plan. I really really really wish it had been that easy.",,,,,,,,

My ex & I are still married & will be when I CTB. I have no assets outside my super & my possessions, some of which I may hock, like maybe my wedding ring, if I get desperate enough or if I splash out on a fancy hotel to do it in. My super refused to change beneficiaries - I was gonna switch it to be a bit of an arsehole ""a few more parting shots"" but they are very clear I can only make a non-binding change & that it would take him 2 seconds to contest & win. So no assets, no change to super. I honestly haven't looked at the kit or seen how long to lodge - I had planned to be gone by now…. It's more to have in the room to show it wasn't spur of the moment & to see when I got it. And to make it clear who I don't want making medical decisions for me if something goes wrong. I've written out my formal wishes & just have to hope that my ex steps up if needed. I think the next closest person would keep me alive to watch me suffer & that's awful but true. I've seen what they are capable of….
Hey
Sorry but I get them from a long- term psych that doesn't hand out until you've been a long term patient. Every other doctor I've seen has refused, even when they see my medical history or whatever. I think there are legit docs & non legit docs & mine is the first & you need the second…If I knew a non legit doc I'd be hitting them up for new antiemetics or some oxy to help with CTB.

I won't implicate my real doctor, am very much avoiding them. I saw a thread on here on how to get meto in 10 min or something…
And one night when the insomnia was really winning, I looked at a bunch of the ""online"" doctors - I've used them in the past, twice for sinus infections, & once for another common prescription that I'd accidentally run out of, because my doc is expensive & too far away & I get sinus infections at the drop of a hat & the other med was not at all serious. But I timed one call at less than a minute. Less than a fucking minute. And some of their websites let you put in what med you're looking for & meto came up on quite a few. But I'm shit at lying. And worse at direct questions. And if I do it, I'll literally have to run through pretend scenarios or have a script ready like a goddamn job interview. I don't want to implicate a doctor but if it's less than a minute, they're probs not the type to care. And AE sounds important, particularly meto, mine is something else & years old. I'm honestly at the point where I'd rather swap someone some Ritalin or something rather than lie. Which is also terrible. I wish this whole process was a hell of a lot easier.

There's a minor inheritance coming my way & I was gonna use it to pay for a nice hotel to CTB - the lawyers said a week. I feel stupid coz I believed them…. And there's no update. But the promise of it coming is what's allowing me to stay at this address. If I'd known I'd be able to extend my stay, I would've ordered more stuff. DMC also quoted a week with express shipping & I think other peoples calendars just might have more than 7 days in them… I think it's too late to order the meto online though. I had planned to be sneaking some research time today but it doesn't look likely which sucks. The longer it takes… I just want to do it but also not fail. I have expired prochlorezapine (can't remember how to spell it), expired in 2021 & I've never taken it before. I popped one out & it looked normal, wasn't crumbly or smelly or anything, & the guides say to do a test run so I took one an hour ago, & so far, absolutely nothing, fingers crossed. No fits etc. But that also makes me nervous that there's no side effect because they've been rendered useless… always something to worry about - I really thought this would be easy & I feel dumber by the day. I had SN delivered to my house because I believed it (hoping it to be true) to be from legit DMC source & all the reassurances L gave me - apart from it not moving forever - stuck in Ukraine, stuck in Sydney, stuck at the postal sorting place that's walking distance from my house… and then fretting about getting caught etc. More by my ex than Aus post - trying to come up with a lie about what I was getting from the Ukraine did my head in. And yes, instant scripts is where I planned to go if I had to lie - my previous consults with them time at less than a minute. And yes, Chem warehouse is where I'm doing research - I'm going again this week after I look into whether you can use the throat numbing spray to mask the taste of SN. And to look at antacids - I saw someone on here recommending magnesium hydroxide milk of magnesia stuff plus others saying calcium carbonate which is just quickeze here. My problem is because of the privacy issues at home, I have to only use my iPhone & handwriting all my research - it's impossible to hide that I'm writing notes & it'll only make him search for the notebook & then he might find other things. And because of the digital snooping, I can't write notes on my phone. He definitely still had access to them this week. I ""think"" I've now done enough to keep them private but I'm just too scared that there's other tracking stuff. I can write on here because I have a phone cover that blocks my screen & every now & then I'll show him a long work WhatsApp or whatever, so he doesn't question me tapping away to write. But he also just might be reading later anyway. Another ramble sorry - was up most of last night, am devastated todays research is most likely not going to happen. But at least doing a trial run of the AE is something, anything. Thanks for trying to help me, I really appreciate the support on here - I really really really thought I'd be gone weeks ago & feel like a liar that I'm still here. But just because I decided to die, doesn't mean life stops happening & life is just throwing so many obstacles right now, on top of the shittiness. I hate it & I want to go.

,2596763,sugarb,"Jul 15, 2024 at 1:41 AM","I started dating a girl I met online about 5 months ago and we've had a fairly happy/healthy/stable LDR ever since, probably the best relationship either of us has had. She's roughly my age and has similar disorders, so we get along great. Plus, she's very cute. We've talked about meeting IRL; it's a long drive, but potentially feasible.

Trouble is, I plan on CTBing. I've had the idea for a long time, but over the last 3-4 months it's more or less been set in stone.

I told her about my ideation a while back. More recently I confessed my actual planning.

Rough transcript:

Me: Remember how I said I was suicidal?
Her: Yes?
M: I no longer plan on living past age 25.
H: If you plan to kill your self at a specific age, it'll only hurt us both
M: That was my second point
H: Though, I don't mind dying together.
M: I love and care about you a lot, and I feel like I have the capacity to take care of you and make you happier, but I've considered breaking up with you because I know I'm leaving eventually and I worry I'll hurt you somehow.
H: Knowing that our brains work the same way really brings me up
H: If you would rather us break up because you're afraid then I would not mind because I feel the same
H: But I would rather not have us both die hurting because we left the one we care about because we were scared of hurting each other
H: I want to die with you but if you plan to kill yourself before 25 it will only make me die sad
H: I'm trying my hardest not to kill myself because I want to stay with you but if this is how you want to be then I will respect it

We talked more and eventually compromised, saying we could go together after we meet and share a kiss.

Only- I don't really want to die with her, or anyone for that matter. I don't want to kiss anyone. My plan is to go alone- a gunshot on a windy day, listening to music I love.

I care about her and hope she finds happiness- she's sweet and funny and I don't want her to be lonely or cling to someone abusive like she has previously. Making her feel good makes me feel good, albeit briefly. She's already had a very difficult life, SHing since like 12 and experiencing all kinds of trauma. She's really kind and gentle to me- I've been able to tell her things I couldn't tell anyone else- and she'll probably stick with me as long as she can. I'm one of just a few people who treats her well.

I'm probably not going to be CTBing this year or the next unless I get lucky, and having each other gives us both some comfort, but- I don't like the lying. I lie to enough people already and I've probably laid the groundwork to damage her with just the one. Though, as she said- she's had similar thoughts. Who knows, maybe she's on here asking the same questions.

So- should I just stay with her until we naturally drift apart or the time comes? Break it off now? Tell her my actual plans? I don't know what to do. I want us both to be happy.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.",,,,,,,,

No matter how much my mom tries to deny it I know we are broke bc of her, we have debts and debts and debts and debts and she continues going to the casino everyday... from afternoon to 3 am- 4 am.....
I''m always alone at nights... It's been like this since I was 14. I'm 19 now and I'm a neet bc social anxiety and bpd has fucked me up. I've tried to find a job everywhere, but no luck. I dropped college for the third time... what's the point anymore, I give up. I'm just waiting until I have enough money so I can go to Lima to buy N, I'm from Peru so it will be easy for me...

I just hate casinos. I sometimes hate my mom even tho I don't want to bc she can be such a nice person. I hate all of this, and I hate not being able to do anything.
I was scrolling through my audio recordings and found an audio of me arguing with my mom while she was drunk. She admitted being a slut at the casino... My dad has never done anything abt it, hes such a stupid as##ole, my mom keeps blaming him, she says her life is miserable bc of him even tho he always let her do whatever she wanted.
When I was 11 I found out that she was cheating on my dad, she manipulated me into thinking that it was normal, she used to bring the other man home, he really was like a member of the family, this went on for years. Now when I try to bring it up she just starts crying and saying ""I shouldn't have trust you"".
She had an expensive surgery years ag, that's okay tho bc it was for her wellbeing, the thing is that she didn't take care of herself afterwards, dranking alcohol and eating recklessly and so she fell ill again.
When I was younger she always used to buy lot of useless things impulsively, always used to max my dad's cards by buying all the clothes and things she wanted.
She fell for a lot of scams, and even was about to fell for one a couple of months ago, she asked for our advice, even tho we told her not to fell for that bc its was obviously a scam and even tho I showed her a lot of proofs she didn't listen, she just didn't want to. I got lucky bc the the company went down the same day she was about to put money into it.

Idc what she says, its her fault we are broke.
I hate this, I hate everything, I hate myself and I hate hating her.
I just hate this so much bc we werent this poor before, we actually were like upper middle class and losing everything due to someone's bad choices is so frustrating.
This is all so confusing too, she has always done bad things while being so nice to me, I do love her and really don't want to hate her but I just can't help it when I think about everything.
I keep switching between love and hate... and I'm so sick and tired of it.

Im 19 and sometimes I still cry when she leaves the house just like I did when I was 15. I'm even here crying and whinning like a little girl, bc that's what I still am, a little fcking pussy who can't grow up. But it doesn't matter anymore does it?, I've finally found the best method ever, and I'm gonna be finally free.

can't wait to find peace!",,,,,,,,

I come to the conclusion that either A) We were lied to about this place. B) That there is a far greater plan at work. That our lives are in some way courses to learn certain things. To what end though- I can't fathom. Again- why would it even be worth it? You need to learn about bereavement, abuse, suffering- WHY??? Or C) We don't choose to come here. There's nothing mystical at work. Our sense of self simply arises from the way the brain works.

I actually feel like C) is most likely. A) or B) seem to rely on predestiny. If there really is some greater plan at work that we were either tricked into participating in or, we willingly chose to- then presumably, whoever is controlling all this shit knows what we're about to go through and has some reason for putting us through it. I can't for the life of me fathom what that could be though.

Of course, all we do know for sure is that our parents thought it would be a good idea to bring us here.

This is why it does matter that most people are happy. That is what they gain.

The experience of life, which many many people find to be a worthwhile exchange.

Are you saying there is nothing rational about ""I like thing, therefore I will try to experience thing more""? I think this board needs to understand what ""rational"" means, because that is, objectively, a logical line of thinking. ""I like thing, therefore I chose to experience thing"" IS logic. It may not be logic you like, because you don't like thing, or you don't think liking something has value, but it is a logical thought process.

""I am currently alive. This comes with good feelings and bad feelings. I could kill myself, then there would be no good and no bad. I will weigh the good against the bad. . . I am done weighing the good against the bad and have decided I will continue living because I enjoy the good more than I dislike the bad."" That is rational thinking. That is logic.

I understand what you're saying, and I'm not ignoring it. I greatly dissagree that potential happiness is irrelevant.

Option 1: Never live. 0 happiness. 0 suffering. As I said, neutral, or ""simply no value"" in whatever way that makes a difference.

Option 2: Live. Happiness and suffering.

Option 2(a): More happiness than suffering.

Option 2(b): More suffering than happiness.

Never living does not mean the other options do not exist. The question posed is if someone would choose life. They could very well prefer to take their chances with option 2.

You wouldn't apply your logic anywhere else. ""Hey, want to go get ice cream?"" ""The ice cream could taste good or bad, so I'd prefer to not go, therefore any potential good taste is irrelevant."" ""Suit yourself, I'm going to go take my chances with the ice cream."" ""IRRATIONAL"". I'm not ignoring your argument, I just don't think it's good.

,2597576,Morte,"Jul 15, 2024 at 5:10 PM","it does matter, neutral state can only be experienced by those who exist. I guess because you can't differentiate between both, you're making mistakes. The example of ice cream, being one of them. You only choose ice cream because you have a prior need for pleasure, in other words, some value. Assuming you are in a neutral state (0), adding +1 would be beneficial, but irrelevant for someone who has no value (does not exist).

However, if you are in a neutral state, you may get -1 with this choice, as the ice cream may taste bad and make you shit your pants later. Assuming that I can avoid the negative variable as whole and make the positive variable redundant, there is no rational reason for me to choose to continue participating in this numerical sequence.

Therefore, all options 2 are irrational. I mean, irrational would be the worst choice, I'm not going to play semantics here. For every decision in the world there is a logic behind it, it doesn't change that it could be a bad one, that causes you more suffering.",2597503,,,,,,,
,2597584,derpyderpins,"Jul 15, 2024 at 5:19 PM","I understand and I am differentiating. I completely get it. No existence = I don't want anything = I'm not missing out because I don't want/can't feel. It's not complicated and not confusing me.

It simply doesn't rebut the fact that good also exists and can be worth pursuing, no matter how much you repeat it. Someone blissfully unaware of a possibility is still missing out on that possibility. Things can be better, and people may prefer to pursue the better. They can completely understand what you are saying about not being able to miss out if you aren't alive and still rationally choose to take the experience of life with its good and bad.

Until you calculate with odds and chances. If it's a 90% chance of +1 and a 10% chance of -1 it's a winning bet and you are arguably using faultier logic by avoiding it. This is why happiness/ satisfaction statistics matter to this discussion.
It could be a good one that gives you more pleasure. Most of the time, it is.

We have to suffer all while planning, preparing and actually during our SUs just so we don't get committed to a mental institution and instead have to suffer a lifetime of 80+ years?! This makes zero sense to me.

We didn't ask to be brought into this world yet we are forced to suffer 80+ years against our will?

And now i dont know how to explain everything when my parents, professor, or job asks me what happened with these scars, or why i look like a total mess. I cant keep fronting myself as living a normal life. The walls are starting to crack. Its pretty much over for me.

Please if someone has an SN source please dm me it. I cannot keep living life like this. Its a necessity at this point.",,,,,,,,

Will my cat understand I'm dead or will he feel confused and abandoned? He's been abandoned by his old owners once before, and I don't want him to think I'm leaving him too.
Also, Im planning to take a lot of substances and shoot myself if I don't overdose. Would the sight of my body after being shot bother my cat? I don't know if cats can feel traumatized the same way people can, so would he mind the body?

I don't know how a cat would respond to seeing a body with that kind of trauma. But I do know that when my dad passed away at home from cancer, our cat knew that he was gone. We had to wait a couple of hours for his hospice nurse to come and declare an official time of death, and then wait for the funeral home to come get him. So we were there a while, and our cat climbed into bed with him and waited the whole time until he was taken away. This wasn't something she had done before when he was alive.

One day after he died, my mom found the cat curled up on one of dad's old shirts. So she kept it folded in a spot for her and she napped on it until dad's scent faded. Your kitty will definitely know that you're gone and some of them have their own way of grieving.

But seriously. Most mammals will mourn over death (that includes people). Dogs seem to go into a spiral as if the person is coming back and do this until they pass which is such a cruel existence. Cats seems to be a bit different personality wise but they don't take it well. If you have a bond or a companion (not a person) then I think ctb is off the cards until they go. Humans are complete garbage, animals are not.

I've seen a cockatoo pluck out all her chest feathers due to stress/abuse, another had bitten off a toe due to abandonment. It's really quick and noticeable in exotic birds. Bit harder with smaller mammals (rabbits, guinea pigs, ferrets, etc).",,,,,,,,

I think I believe there is an afterlife but I kinda hope there is nothing after this world, I dont like the thought of living in heaven/hell for an eternity.

Could it be that our worldly regrets and troubles follow us in the next realm and we dont find the peace we seek? We all wish each other peace on goodbye threads but we dont know where, if anywhere, were going.

This troubles me greatly going into the unknown and that fear keeps me here, existing for the time being.

If life is hard, why should it change after our biological body dies?

The best option for such people is nothingness.
Nothingness is a bit unconvincing and scary to me, so I push it out of my consciousness.
I also do not believe in heaven where ""good"" people go and hell where ""evil"" people go. This is a naive concept for me.

Overall, I don't believe in anything at the moment.
But if we still have some form of consciousness after death, I don't think we can count on complete peace.
Maybe we'll be reincarnated or something like that? Maybe other worlds? Who knows.

I believe that things like heaven and hell specificaly are big bs fairytales created by the powerful, to force people into some specific lifestyle, using hell as intimidation tool. It most likely doesn't exist. How can you even experience suffering in hell as portrayed by religions when your body already died. There's no pain without body's receptors.

Nature doesn't differentiate between causes of deaths. It doesn't even know the concept of right and wong. Morality is a made up ideology created by society which constantly changes, applicable merely within the human realm. Nature can't judge how good of a person someone was to send them to some special place after death. So I believe whatever comes after death is exactly the same for everyone.",,,,,,,,

However, of course you're free to believe in whatever you want.

I believe that after death is just non existence because it seems to be the most logical conclusion and yet also the most peaceful scenario. Of course it's really hard to actually wrap your head around non existence and how that can be peaceful for us as.. there wouldn't even be an us anymore but I just find the absence of suffering to be peaceful relative to my life.

every night i fall asleep thinking about how me and my brother were sexually assaulted as children and how i should have helped him. it's not fair to him that he killed himself and that i am still alive. he was a lot smarter than me, a lot braver, a lot funnier. i genuinely think it should have been me. i'm at least glad his suffering has ended. but i need to join him eventually.
i'm in a good place somewhat right now. i don't live with my parents anymore. i have had a stable job that i enjoy for a year now. i have saved up enough to put myself through uni and i'm finally going in september. i still know, like always, that my inevitable date approaches. it's something i have to do. i don't know how to explain it. even if i didn't want to do it, i would still have to. i guess it is my duty. it sounds very melodramatic lol but i don't know how else to express it.

Our society is crazy. I looked into a few cases where teens that were sexually abused for years finally killed their abuser.

The government wants obedient slaves! Most people just repeat the same cycle every day: get up >go to work > eat > sleep! Most people are brainwashed thinking we are free! We are born into a prison and I see it as stupid and disgusting that people don't see how horrible the world is yet they keep breeding cause they are selfish! They want a kid! Then when the kid becomes an adult they throw their creation away like it is a used toy! Now we are here suffering cause we are randomly born! We never asked to be born yet we are forced to participate in all this useless trash! Then when we are old the employer let's us retire! Our whole life all most people do is being a slave, kissing a** then when you retire you have little time to no energy left then you die! Now tell me is a life like this really worth living?

I feel like the difference between working and slavery is we are paid and we are granted two days out of the week to relax if you work full time.

Slaves were told what to do, when to wake up, taught to obey and to ensure they were serving their masters.

How am I any different? Oh, it's just paid.

I do not mean to downplay what historical slavery is, of course that kind of slavery is something else entirely.
But still, when you objectively look at how our society works, we are basically slaves. If you are born without any inheritance, your option is either to work or be homeless which basically means being an outlaw with no humans rights pretty much. The fact that loitering is an offense is the proof of it.

If you do not have a home wtf are you suppose to do? You are not allowed to go into the wild and build your own house and have your own self sustainable farm, are you? In theory by being a citizen of a country the country is also yours, still you are not entitled to anything that country has to offer. If a fucking squirrel is allowed to be part of nature and not worry about his property tax why can't I? Do I even have to go into what borders are? The fact you are literally NOT ALLOWED to take a step beyond an imaginary border because a document says so? Am I the only one seeing how fucking absurd this is.

If my wish is to be in nature and not use any public service or perk why am I not allowed to? Is it really that absurd to believe that just by existing I am deserving of land? Why is it my problem if some selfish asshole who came before me decided I have to follow his little game? You are LITERALLY FORCED to work and to pay taxes to exist, because the alternative is sleeping on a sidewalk while you wait to die from some kind of disease or even worse be locked in a jail cell for as long as the system wants to. There is no alternative other than be part of a system that was designed by other people who only have their own interests in mind. Seriously fuck this shit.

this is a life that we're born in and have learned to an extent. whether to live in due to ignorance or acceptance.
people suffering in other countries is not in our individual control especially as mere workers just trying to get by. it's not within most people's capacity to even spend energy on other society's issues when we're already faced with our own. we instead have to focus on our own lives, in a place where a system runs differently not without its many problems -- such as 'modern day slavery.'

There are obviously varying levels of privelage and atrocity within it but it's all making you do something you don't particularly want to do because the alternative is worse. The conditions we work under and the consequences of not working vary but they are quite often bad and exploitative.

And yes, I don't think it's fair to just birth a being into this world and expect them to comply. I wish parents thought harder about the genes and circumstances they were inflicting on their children too.

I have creative genes. Most creative people I know are struggling enormously in this world to get by. Or- they've given up on what they want to do and they're wage slaving. (It doesn't usually feel enough to 'do it as a hobby'. Wage slavery is exhausting and time consuming. It's easy to just give up when you spend your whole time working or sleeping.)

And of course- my lot comparitively speaking is massively privelaged. I do realise that. Imagine children being born and then forced into child labour or- left to starve. I truly can't get my head around why people want that for their children! Like- are they actually birthing them as employees for them? To bring in money for them?

You can say ""I don't want anything to do with this!"", but, then, obviously, there are consequences.

Or you can spend sometime (not easy, but still possible), to find work that has less hours (like between 4 to 6 hours), but you gain less and harder to find work like that.

Or open your own business. If you are efficient you don't need to work so many hours, I assume.

The whole idea of suicide prevention is deeply sadistic and abhorrent, for one to believe that it's justified interfering in such a basic human right they must truly lack any compassion, I find it hellish how many humans wish to prolong the meaningless suffering of others for as long as possible, trapping them in an existence so futile and making existence into a prison where one cannot painlessly escape on their own terms.

The fact that access to a painless death isn't already a human right truly is deeply unacceptable and criminal, it's horrific how suicide isn't accepted even know we were so unfairly forced into this hellish existence in the first place, we were so cruelly forced to be conscious and aware in an existence where there is unlimited potential for agony and torment.

Existence truly is nothing more than an unnecessary harm and to exist means to suffer so unnecessarily all while risking experiencing much worse suffering at any moment just to decay and die anyway. The pointless and torturous burden of a human was never desirable or worth having to me in the first place and this is why I find suicide prevention evil as nobody consented to any of this so they should simply be able to free themselves at any moment.

No matter what suicide is something to accept not prevent, it's deeply tragic the amount of immense harm that suicide prevention causes, all that suicide prevention does is prolongs unnecessary suffering, it truly disgusts me how suicide is seen as what is terrible even know all that causes one to suffer is ultimately as a result of existence.

To be against people eternally escaping from this existence on their own terms will always be so sadistic, I'm repulsed by how we exist in this society filled with people believing that people must suffer no matter what, pro-lifers just make me wish to be eternally free from this hellish existence even more.",,,,,,,,

I was a revolving door patient, always in and out of hospital and nothing really changing. This particular time I just decided - that's it, the longer I go without food, the sooner I will die. That was my mindset. In no way at all was it easy and in no way would I recommend this to anyone. I thought I would die long before I got to the weight I did. I could deal with chest pain, the exhaustion, even the muscle wastage to an extent. But then I started going blind, so I panicked, I started eating a bit more - I wanted to die, not go blind. However, as much as I increased my intake a bit more, it just fell off faster. My flat became my jail cell. I couldn't tell anyone what was going on so I isolated myself from everyone - that was hell on earth as all I wanted was to tell someone how awful I felt. Day by day, week by week, I became so weak, I couldn't leave the house, I couldn't shower without needing a lie down, I couldn't put my socks on or get off the couch, I couldn't lift my duvet off me to get out of bed, and in the end, I couldn't even support my own head without some 'manual' help with my hands. Anything I did manage to do, was followed by a lie down. Long story short, it was the blindness that freaked me into admitted what I was doing. I was admitted to hospital straight away weighing in at a BMI of 9, I had severe muscle wastage, my organs were all failing, I developed psychosis, and to top it all, I ended up temporarily brain damaged and lost the ability to even communicate effectively for several months. Whilst it is a miracle I survive, I suffered PTSD from that alone. Nowadays I still have issues with communicating effectively. To this day I still wish I had died - being told if I'd stayed home one more day and I wouldn't have made it - makes it feel all the more crappy - I came so close.

In the USA if a person announces they are suicidal or try to kill themselves they are quickly put on a facility.

This is how hard it is to get put in a mental facility in the UK.

If a doctor or family member express concern about your mental health and believe you should be put in to a facility they can make an application for you to be sectioned.

Two doctors and an Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP) who can be a social worker or someone working in healthcare all have to agree on the decision to have you sectioned.

I came close to death 2 years ago while abusing laxatives. I was absolutely terrified even though I have been wanting to die since 21.

It's strange how the minute you realise your own existence is close to coming to an end life suddenly becomes beautiful. I still can't believe how I was in wonder and awe at waking up the next day and looking outside the window at how beautiful the sun and sky was, it felt like I was seeing it for the first time. That day I finally began to understand when people say waking up is a blessing.

My outlook did change for a bit and yes my life did begin to improve. Everything was going so well until it all came crashing down like an avalanche in 2023. I went from having the best year of my life in 2022 to the worst year of my life in 2023. Starting from New Years Day a string of things kept going wrong for me in all areas of my life even simple things were going wrong. I had 1 year of straight bad luck I couldn't believe how rapidly everything went wrong. Its another crazy long story

These events along with the intense emotional pain of everything going wrong in my life drove me back to laxative abusing. I finally had a nervous breakdown last month at 27 because of everything that I went through last year People in my life think I am dramatic for depressed over everything that happened to me and tell me the bullshit pharse ""everything happens for a reason"".

The events of last year are the reason why I actually want to die again, I kept fighting and fighting but I finally had enough of life. That year finally broke me as a person.

I hope one day my heart stops beating because I can't do it anymore.",2548450,,,,,,,

@Lady Laudanum Thanks for sharing your story

Dying slowly doesn't scare me anymore because everyday I can feel my soul and myself dying.

Everyday when I look in the mirror to see my eyes all I see is nothing deep inside. What I mean by nothing is no spark, no warmth, no joy and all I see an empty tunnel . I don't recognise my reflection anymore all I see is a stranger behind the glass mirror. I don't even have the flu but everyday I feel flu like, i dont understand this . Just like the flu I am chronically exhausted all the time, I keep crying with my eyes being with my eyes puffed up and I struggle with breathing sometimes due to stress and anxiety.

My body no longer feels under my control but under the control of something else, a darker entity. Everyday I feel it. Having an eating disorder along with suicidal thoughts feels like having a doppelganger within you that stalks, shadows your life and slowly works to steal everything good you have in your life until it finally takes over your life.
As grow older I realise now people die from suicide not because their bodies succumbed to the illness but because the illness, the doppelganger won in taking total dominance of that person's body, mind and soul.",2596410,2548660,,,,,,

I need to die
I need to fucking die
I emailed Samaritans:
im suicidal and a whore, im such a fucking slut

a few days ago there was this very cuddly cat
i stayed outside my apartment with him on my lap
i thought, this is it, i could still be redeemable
god is telling me to shut up again and make this work again

im in my home country to finish my studies bc I could do it right in the uk. here we have many stray cats and dogs
i was going to adopt him and I bought stuff from the pet store and on my way home I spotted a little black kitten near one of the corner shops

I couldn't believe it
The lady told me she found these kittens at the back somewhere of the corner shop, they've been neglected
skinny and their nails are long, the black kitten had lost its fur in some places
I don't remember if the other one also lost some fur but I remember it was orange

I've always wanted a little black kitten called tabitha
I would give them the world
I just wanted a sign thta I'm a good person
I would keep going
I took her in
I had her for a few days, she stayed in a laundry basket
I left her some food

I killed her

This is what I wrote to my online friend:
im terrible and i don't deserve anything, im twisted and sick. let me make it easy fo your : the kitten has worms but im pretty sure it's 90 percent my fault and 10percent warms, she still had food in her dish, oh. it's a he. I was going to feed her. I didn't know I couldn't bathe him. Im a moron, im fucking stupid. I thought he was fine I was going to feed him later, he stopped eating. He's in the vet now, critical decision
he could die
I'm trying to think if I left out anything else that's horrible of me
im fucking stupid okay?

it's only recently I've been trying to feel alive. Again
I haven't even enrolled in school here
I tried to kill myself last weekend
It was poor timing
I thought I could manage him
But it's the same kind of feelings i had when I neglected my second hamster at the end of her couple months
I left her in my care of my little brother and my dad, told them to just feed her
The cage stunk
Then she died
My little brother never got to hold her
I was 15 then
But that's no excuse
I did tell my two therapist before

I'm 20 and I'm actually like a fucking tall child
I deserve the death sentence

I'm sick and twisted

This gave me a sick and twisted reality check that I shouldn't ask for more, I should just isolate myself

I texted my dad tonight also
About how I want to come back to the uk and I'll just work at a fast food place
I'll spent my last remaining months sleeping in most days, working and drinking

I'm also an alcoholic
Why did I think I could manage a little black kitty
I'm fucking unstable for fucks sakes

I understand if im not allowed to use your service, im horrible after all.
And I did hear you guys' Emily service is international but I'm unsure
nevertheless
thank you,
I just wanted a little buddy who could follow me a round
Like an emotional support animal

Tonight I thought of throwing myself off the taxi
But my aunt's been looking after me just to get the hang of this place
And that would be traumatising
To add on, drink and drink and eventually jump off that bridge I've always wanted to jump off of

I drank some more
I only have like 2 shots left

I was crying and zoning out, staring into space
And sometimes when I get stresses i get pins and needles
My hands did that, I couldn't write on the piece of paper at the vet at first
I'm sick and twisted
I'm such a fucking whore
What a slit
Fucking slu
T
Whore
Slut
animal killer
animal hater
horrible person
asshole
piece of shit

I apologies this will be the last time I reply again
I wanted a saving grace you know?
A big fucking sign
But I'm still an asshole
If I'm being forgiven, forget it
It's hopeless
FCUK I'm so fucking drunk now
I'm going to keep calling my friend because of how sick and twisted I am
My online friend
What else is du,bass me missing
What lease do I have to mention
I'm a fucking idiot
Why did thinking moving here to my home country would be a good idea
I had to get out of that house in h uk somehow and fast
I hate my parents
But now I'm here dealing with other blood, my other relatives
I hate my aunt Wh o is taking care of me
At least I know how to deal with my parents, 85% knowing how to deal with them

So there was no trace of the mother. So maybe the mother had a fatal disease that was passed on to the kitten. Sadly kittens are vulnerable and if your kitten was neglected before you had him then he probably had other things wrong with him as well as the worms. You gave him a time when he was loved and cared for before whatever was wrong with him hit him hard. What you gave him was food, love and care, far more than he'd ever experienced in his little life before. Don't beat yourself up for being such a caring loving person. Ask anyone in the vet world, but when you take on a neglected uncared for very young animal the chances of them getting sick and even dying are much higher than one that had a better start in life, no matter how good your care once they are with you. It's not your fault. You did your best and that is awesome. Sending huge grateful hugs for being the best person, who didn't walk away from that little soul.",2597269,,,,,,,

They also may have already had some underlying health issues.

I don't know why you feel as though you are a slut, but even if you are one of them so what? That doesn't make you a bad person. It doesn't say anything about your self-worth.

i am in this constant state of fear semi from neurological issues and it's so bad it blocks everything, not just stuff related to suicide.
i'm wondering if any of you have had a similar problem and maybe if you know of any substances specifically drugs that could just quickly chemically bring down the fear levels? The only one I can think of is weed, but I have had some issues with that.

If you understand what I mean, thank you.
What I'm asking for really is just drugs. I can use to chemically bring down that fear super quickly.
I don't plan on living, so don't worry about long-term effects of recreational substances or anything.

I once took oxycodone pills and only after a week and a half of daily use, my dose had doubled and I was already addicted and had horrible withdrawals if I didn't take them.

Unfortunately it also makes me quite tired and sluggish so if you need to somehow still be able to focus I don't really know.

Keep benzos to 2-3 times a week and in irregular intervals and you should be fine.
Not all work the same though. Lorazepam might be better than Alprazolam if it works fine for you since it has a longer duration of effect, but then again you might feel better with one over the other.
Phenelzine also comes to mind, it's a quiet effective MAOI, but as opposed to let's say Tranylcypromine it can also be used with anxiety.

,2578620,Darkover,"Jun 29, 2024 at 1:58 AM","the tireless measures that are being taken by governments to try and restrict access to lethal suicide methods.
suicide methods do exist and could be made available to people who wanted to end their lives, in order to deprive people of these methods via legal controls is an active way of keeping people trapped in circumstances that are causing severe harm. When people are left with less effective suicide methods, then they must consider the risks of surviving those suicide attempts with catastrophic consequences, such as being left so severely disabled by the attempt that it would be impossible to commit suicide in the future, and also illegal for anyone to euthanize you:
I would thus argue that restricting access to reliable suicide methods which exist is tantamount to institutionalized torture, and because the individual will often continue to live due to the lack of an easy exit, it can be considered to be slavery as well, as they are not living for their own reasons, but living because society denies them an easy exit and instead enacts policies that effectively force them to continue to exist against their will, for reasons that reflect society's interests rather than the interests of the individual.",,,,,,,,

I do get why we blame our governments but I think we sometimes forget that the right to die- especially if you aren't terminally ill probably isn't a widely popular wish. I imagine the majority of the population actually supports our governments in restricting lethal substances.

I ran a poll a while back to see how many people thought their families would support them in their right to die- if assisted suicide were actually available. Very few thought they would.

Even with my own family. Today my mom got mad at me for not putting away laundry. I feel ignored when I mention again how I have lack of focus (unmedicated ADHD). I feel useless.

I made a joke about how Trump chose Vance as a running mate so they only have to change two letters and I was ignored. Then 20 minutes later my sister sends me something of someone saying the same joke. 'I just said this 20 minutes ago and no one said anything' 'oh I wasn't listening'.

I've had too little strength since I was a child, it's true.
Guys, I feel incredibly bad.
I wrote a lot of posts on this forum about why I feel bad and why my soul hurts.
I wrote about the cruel systems in this world, starting with the animal world, where animals gnaw at each other, experiencing fear and intense pain.
Animals, birds and fish are brutally killed for food.
Some people cruelly abuse animals.
People make videos about torturing someone, raping them, taking them into sexual slavery and getting paid for it.
The whole world is saturated with lies and lies.
We don't know our real History.
Wars and dismemberments are going on here all the time.

I'm getting older and feeling the dark side of the world more and more.

I can't work. I DON'T WANT TO WORK.
at the age of 20, I went to work for the first time.
And even then I had money problems.
I couldn't work all the time, so I saved up money to quit and stay at home.
I didn't pay my rent because the money I had saved was only enough for food.

My problems were not noticed in childhood.
Even as a child, I refused to go to kindergarten according to the system.
I often asked my parents to leave me at home.
I often skipped school because I hate this 5/2 system.
I often skipped my studies at the university.

I understand that even if I were rich, I would like to die, because everything that happens in the world is too terrible.

But I come from a poor family.
Now I am 27 years old and I have a lot of debts.
And my brain still can't die.
I'm cursed.
I'm tired of the injustice in this world.

I cry almost every day, asking the universe to stop bullying animals and using violence against people in the world. I'm asking you to stop trafficking people.

But nothing happens, of course.

I should have died when I was 4 years old.
Mom said that I got sick, stopped eating and drinking, I stopped responding to everything and the doctors couldn't help.
Mom said that she and my dad wrapped me in a blanket and didn't know what to do anymore since no one could help.

But there was a doctor who ""saved"" me.
I hate him now because he resurrected me for this slave cruel world.

People do nasty things when they need money.

And you know what?
I'M STILL AFRAID TO DIE.
I hate myself for that.
I am still afraid that I will become disabled because I will do something wrong.
I'm still afraid of physical pain.
And my brain has an incredibly strong instinct for self-preservation.

I can't even buy normal drugs to overdose on, because we don't make high-quality clean drugs and they cheat very often, so people don't get drugs in the end, and the money disappears.

I feel very bad.

I wanted to hang myself, having drunk alcohol and sleeping pills before that, so that I would fall into a noose and not feel the instinct of self-preservation.
But I'm still afraid that because of the sleeping pills, I won't be able to control the process, I'll hang myself incorrectly and suffocate while half-conscious.

I also really like the idea of notifying the emergency service my location and announcing my departure, it would ensure my body is taken care of relatively fast by professionals.

Firearms are instantaneous and inert is somewhat delayed allowing you to abort up to the point of no return, which would probably come as a surprise. With firearms you really have to commit and pull that trigger, there's no second chances it's one final pull and then nothing.

I like the idea of having the option to abort, but I also like the absolute certainty of firearms. They're are really tied in the purpose of ctb but I really romanticize the scenario of sitting alone somewhere secluded and either succumb to the fact I have to die or keep struggling another week. When the final call is made it really puts the pressure to either commit or become incarcerated.

both my ex and i are severely mentally ill, and he has a fucking shotgun
i would feel utterly horrible if he did that shit (it's not 90% if it's motherfucking buckshot!!), he's got much more potential and many more reasons to live than i've ever had. he has many more ambitions than me, a massive capability and downright skill in learnin shit, overall a lovely lad and he's kinda tanking because, as it turns out, i'm just about as good as a knife to the liver. horrid while it's there, potentially deadly if removed. i've done that to a lot of people and i feel horrible about it, but i've doubtless affected him the most.
wondering where to go, what to do, and how to keep him from killing himself, because he genuinely does not deserve to die. i'm debatable (despite a horrid pattern of behavior), but there's no questions asked bout him.

Forced life is very sad. Why! Why does dying have to be Hard?,2517210,Blueth,"May 13, 2024 at 8:08 AM","I need to make my first attempt soon. And I hope it will be the last.

I will need to somehow ask my family for cash to buy everything I need. And I don't know what impact this will have for them later.

I can't go out or go to the hotel. Because of my situation, I can't give them a reason for this.

And they wouldn't let me be alone anyway.

At the same time, I haven't gone out for years... And if I suddenly go out, other reasons will be added to this and it will attract a lot of suspicion.

Cutting my wrists vertically or sticking a knife into the jugular vein or heart were not recommended at all.

These were the first methods that came to my mind.

I had thoughts of doing this under hot water at night when everyone was asleep.

I was thinking about cyanide, but I learned that it is banned... It has been used for suicides in the past, which led to the decision to ban its sale.

Unfortunately, hanging myself completely at home, hidden from everyone, is not an option.

At the same time, psychologically, this method is harder than sticking a knife in my heart.

Yesterday I found the veins in my throat for the partial suspension method, and observed what would happen by applying pressure for the first time.

I felt my face swell and something stop or move in the veins next to my eyes. And again I realized that the drowning method was not possible for me.

I'm not sure yet, but SN seems like something I can access. I think there will be no problem if they do not ask for any documents to purchase.

I have over-the-counter painkillers and pills for nausea at home.

However, I do not know if there is any drug with antidepressant effect.

If there is any left over of my mother's medications, maybe I can take a few without realizing it.

Unfortunately I'll have to do this in my room when everyone else is asleep.

I physically put two of the letters I wrote yesterday on paper. The first one was written as a dedication to my entire family.

The other one is for my mother.

That leaves 4 more letters that need to be physically put on paper. I will try to complete this today.

For someone of my weight, 25 grams of SN in 50ml of water is enough, at least that's what it says.

Eating is not something I can do psychologically anyway. I just don't feel like eating.

So fasting will not be difficult. I've seen stun sprays on the internet. These are ether-based sprays.

I don't know how logical it would be to be exposed to it and faint after taking SN.

If the sprays work and I pass out, I don't know if I'll still throw up.

Ether was used for anesthesia in old times.

However, although they are sold today, they are not used. I haven't fully researched its effect either.

I don't have the strength to do this anyway.

It's not fair that it's so hard for a wish to die in a shitty situation to become a reality.

For years, I have been wishing to be erased from existence every time before sleep.

And just in case this might be a big wish, I have a ""sleep wish"" with multiple alternatives.

Sometimes I express the wish, sometimes I repeat it in my mind, and sometimes I say ""Hello, my sleep wish."" I gathered all the alternatives under this sentence.

But there are no miracles and that's why I have to write this right now. Sometimes I think it might be easier to do it with someone who really wants to die. But trusting is hard in itself.

I wish it were possible for everyone to swallow a capsule and reach the end like in the movies.

Or if everything was a dream when I woke up and I was someone who never had a family.

That way I wouldn't have to care which method it was and would go to the end.

The medications I currently have are as follows.

° Nausea pill. Active ingredient: 10 mg metoclopramide HCl
° Rileptide 1MG contains 1MG Risperidone.
And there is this information: RILEPTID belongs to the group of medicines used in cases of some kind of mental disorder (psychosis).
° RANTUDIL FORTE 60MG RANTUDIL FORTE contains acemethazine as the active ingredient. Acemetazine belongs to a group of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAI) drugs that have anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic effects.
° Prozac 25 mg.
° Paraflex 250 mg
It is a muscle relaxant agent that acts on the central nervous system and is used in painful conditions of skeletal muscles.
° ATARAX 25MG

I do not know which of these drugs should be used and which should not be used. My mind feels like it's going to explode and unfortunately I can't take action and research.

Notes:

° I found a product with the following description for the test kit for SN. Description: ""TO determine the nitrite (NO2) value in freshwater and marine aquariums."" The product has a mixing bowl, we shake the sample and 15ml of liquid that comes with the product at the specified rate and control the color that emerges after 5 minutes.

(There are many kits on Amazon, but the delivery date is very long.)

I am writing this text through a translator, so I apologize in advance for stupid mistakes.
Tonight I plan to commit suicide by partial hanging. I won't describe my actions in detail - I'm not sure of them. in fact, I want to live, but I don't know how. I don't consider myself an unhappy person. I have everything: good looks, awesome taste in music, some financial stability, intelligence (this intelligence is unfortunately not enough to learn English), laziness, disgusting relationships with family and loved ones. I can't say that I have any reason for my reluctance to live. My self-esteem is completely unstable. my body sometimes inspires me, sometimes disappoints me. For as long as I can remember, I have always considered myself fat and awkward. There were times when I stopped eating completely. I fainted from hunger and received constant reproaches from my mother that I was eating too much. For the last 6 years I have realized that my life will end very soon. and I will die by my own hands. I am too fixated on my appearance and do not pay attention to everything that happens around me. I passed my school exams with the highest marks, but after school I did not go on to study further. I had many opportunities to become someone significant in this world, but my obsession with appearance prevented me from doing so. Reading this, you might think that I am quite a beautiful girl with complexes. but my beauty is not clear to everyone. Not everyone will find me attractive. I always thought that I should die beautiful. and constantly worked towards my weight loss goal. but now I look at myself and realize that I couldn't do it. I couldn't lose weight to my desired weight, I couldn't grow my hair or find my perfect makeup. I've only been deteriorating for the last year. All my old friends turned their backs on me, except my boyfriend. my image became repulsive. and only in this image did I find my little happiness. but this is contrary to the normal way of life. I don't see my good future. I worry about my grandparents, how they will cope with my death. It hurts to see your grandson die before you. I may not succeed tonight, but I hope for the best. I just want to leave this world. I want my mind to find peace. I want to disappear. Only today I began to feel that my life is almost over.",,,,,,,,

This is correct and can be done even when there is a password/passcode. They can brute-force in with special software.
Mobile device forensics involves the use of specialized tools and techniques to extract data from a mobile device, including both the device's memory and any external storage media, such as a SIM card or SD card. The extracted data can include text messages, call logs, contacts, photos, videos, and other types of digital evidence.

Mobile device forensics is often used in criminal investigations, as well as in civil and corporate cases, to uncover evidence related to cyber crimes, fraud, and other types of wrongdoing. It is also used to recover lost or deleted data, such as photos or text messages, for personal or business purposes.",2594238,,,,,,,

,2594534,Cress,"Jul 12, 2024 at 10:35 PM","They can still clone the phone and get through even if it's password protected. Depending on the provider of phone that you have they might give everything over to law enforcement and unlock the phone using admin privileges when the police come with a warrant.

If you're wondering why they would go to the trouble of looking through your phone if it's obvious that you self deleted to catch the bus. They want to make sure that no one encouraged or contributed to you catching the bus. Aka something similar to Michelle Carter That happened a few years ago. If someone did encourage you to see tb they want to discover That.

However I should say they're probably not going to dig very far. They will look through probably all of your text messages and maybe some social media like Facebook To see who you've been in contact with around the point of your death. They are unlikely to look through absolutely everything On your device however if it doesn't seem relevant. They are not going to check every website you've ever visited Or thoroughly check every file so there's something that they will miss.",2594238,,,,,,,

Your device's collectively specific data On everything that you've been doing recently. They will look at all of that but they're unlikely to go back years if that's what you worried about. They have the ability to look at certain keywords that you might have typed as well.

When someone goes to trial for Poisoning their spouse and they look at their device and there's Google searches for ""How long does x poison take to kill someone?"" or "" Is x poison detectable in the bloodstream at autopsy?. They ultimately end up using all of that as evidence for building their case. They will likely do the same for you and see what you've been recently searching and who you've been talking to. Yes they're also likely to see that you've been on sanctioned suicide.

,2594634,Cress,"Jul 13, 2024 at 1:25 AM","Yeah your router has some sort of rudimentary search history of the websites that you visit. People use routers to block traffic from various sources all the time and if it doesn't know where you're visiting how can it know what to block. Law enforcement can always request your information from Google or your Internet service provider.

However everything is going to be way more obfuscated and difficult to put together if your devices aren't available to them. It depends on how much of a pain you make it for them to put it together. If you're sure you're not coming back after your attempt and you really want To be anonymous and cover everything the best thing you can do is to take your router modem and your devices and drop them in a lake.

There is going to be some suspicion surrounding your death but it's going to be pretty evident that you self deleted it's not going to be a Homicide they aren't going to send divers combing the river looking for your devices.

There is a feature that is supposed to catastrophically erase the phone's contents after a certain number of consecutive, failed login attempts. But whatever the cops use to break into the phones, it must completely bypass the PIN, somehow. I feel stupid for being caught off guard by it, to be honest... of course they were going to figure out how to break them eventually, even without Apple's blessing... really should have seen that one coming.

Just make your passcode is not guessable. Happy to be told I'm wrong! Android is probably a lot more vulnerable.

If your device is connected to Google accounts with your search history then it won't really matter.
You'll either need to delete the Google account,
have never shared the account name with anyone,
possibly have used only a VPN to access the account,
and hope Google don't share the information upon request somehow else.
Really depends what exactly you were aiming to keep private in the first place. I don't know their exact policy, just guessing what could happen if they wanted answers strongly enough. As other posts have mentioned if they have admin access to your router or contact the ISP for logs they could dig further that way on websites you've visited and possibly find your account on a forum like this using some detective skills.

If they have access to your hard drives and you don't dispose of those, the phone won't really matter to be honest. You probably have all your logins automated.

Mid-30s, female, somewhat nice life. Owe money but who doesn't. Good job. Up for promotion. Advancing career.

Mentally ill but pretty stable? Bipolar but not actively depressed. I don't think.

Why am I here? Well, my thoughts swirl around with the dark thoughts. Stuff I've always been afraid to say out loud to anyone. The kind of stuff that gets you sectioned or investigated by the pigs.

I live with a sibling and parent. Two dogs. I've never dated. Never really had interest. Too weird and shy, and just not having the urge. I don't really care anymore.

I don't fear being alone when I'm old. Hell, I don't imagine myself BEING old. I never have. It's always been in the back of my mind that one day I'll CTB. One day, but not today.

I don't want to upset my mom or my sister. And my dogs wouldn't understand. I love them all too much. But once they are gone, like I said I don't picture myself being old or dying of old age.

Maybe I won't CTB until I'm 80. I just know one day I'll go looking for that bus stop.",,,,,,,,

The type of good package e.g sale of goods does change however it cannot be gone off of due to the minimal amount of options where coincidentally it ends up to be the same.

Since last year there has been a change in packaging multiple times on both the inside contents and outer from a more clear vacuum sized container to one less blatant and disguised almost by such writing outside, Outer packaging varies but realistically it will a bubble mailer or plastic mail bag for example more for volumetric reasons where there honestly isn't much choice

When i finally spotted her I tried my best to get her back but the society complex barricade prevented me from me reaching her, when I finally got hold of her by pushing the barricade aside(not enough for me to fit in), she gave me a very deep scar on my palm and i impulsively let her go. She then ran away outside the complex, it was all very dark and raining. I tried looking but couldn't find her, this happened on 11th July 2024, we tried looking for her for past few days but couldn't find her anymore. Today my mom saw a bloated dead body of a cat with similar colours like mine floating in large pothole filled with water, just outside our building complex. I confirmed it was her, since then I'm just crying and trying to collect every piece of media I have of her to back it up on the cloud. She was born just around this time last year and i adopted her on 17 September 2023, she was my first pet, even in this short time I've been so attached to her, I wish I could hold her again.

Once all of my family members left I tried one last time to get her back and she did came out when I called her. I slid my arm by pushing that flexible steel wire mesh aside from the bottom(the part where it connects to the wall) and held her by the neck, once I got her into the society complex itself into the parking. , I was trying to take her back to our house on the first floor, but she scratched my palm really deep with her claws(she was very afraid) then she fell from my hands she hid under a car, when I tried to get her out from there but she started running away, i tried to chase after her but it probably scared her even more she ran outside of the parking through the front gate and then disappeared (there's a row of cars parked in around along with lots of bushes (i hate living in this forested area), I tried looking but couldn't find her.
She doesn't like be held, she never ventured out except on one occasion, she was an indoor cat. She only cuddled with me and no one else.

Day 15: the sequel to ""How to kill yourself in fourteen days.""

A poem by: TheLamest

The fourteen days are over. There is no reason left to perform. The lights are off and the air is cold and wet. Comfort is a thing of the past, and you can't remember the name of your best friend anymore. Everything hurts, but you're still so numb.

What is there anymore?

The stage is empty. There's no one left. They're all gone, or maybe you are.

There were reasons to stay.

Your mother would wonder what she did wrong. Her child, her precious child, taken from her in one fell swoop. She wasn't the best anyone could have asked for, but she was yours, wasn't she?

What you were capable of rather than who you are was never what mattered. Both her and I are sorry you ever had to believe that your achievements were worth more than yourself.

Your sister would never be the same. She would grow around it, but there would always be this you-shaped hole by her heart, just around the jut of her ribcage.

She will have kids. They'll look through old family photos and ask who you are. She will try not to burst into tears.

You wouldn't be the same, either. You'd be gone.

No more laughter.
No more tears.
No more failing tests,
Or binge-watching a new TV show,
Or experiencing crippling guilt/grief/all of the above,
Or jumping on leaves during autumn like a child in a muddy puddle.

...

On the fifteenth day you wake up in bed. Everything hurts and your eyes are sticky. You sit up, expecting unfamiliarity, only to find your room staring back at you. Your stuffed animals are still where you left them. The note on your desk is just as prominent as before. You will take a breath and situate yourself, because that will be the thing to do.

Was it all a dream?

On the fifteenth day you will walk out of your room and find your mother and tell her you love her before she can get a word in. You will shake and sob into her arms and she will ask you what is wrong and the only thing you can think of is that you don't want to be ill anymore, because that will be the thing to do.

Your mother will never fully understand you, but she doesn't need to do that to love you.

On the fifteenth day you will eat breakfast after months of skipping it and it will be the best thing you have ever tasted. You will get to school on time and say good morning to the teacher as you sit down, because that will be the thing to do.

The class will seem a whole lot more interesting, and you'll understand it, if only briefly.

On the fifteenth day you will sit with new people at lunch and they will laugh at your joke. It will be the most loved you have felt in a long time. You will let them when they try to stay in your life, because that will be the thing to do.

You never needed to push people away, your illness does not make you unloveable.

On the sixteenth day you will write something meaningful and stare at it for hours after the last word indented itself to the paper. You will find more beauty in what you have not yet discovered. You will keep writing, because that will be the thing to do.

Discover words that haven't been written. Know them like honey on your tongue and love them as sweetly.

On the nineteenth day you'll forget that you were counting in the first place, because that will be the thing to do.

The days will get better. The days will get better. The days will get better.

On the twenty-first day you will laugh so hard you fall over. One of your friends will tell a joke and you will just keep laughing, because that will be the thing to do.

It really wasn't that funny, but it was enough for you. Are you more than enough for yourself?

On the fiftieth day twenty-nine days has passed. You will find a new hobby. It's never interested you before, and you're not very good at it, but surprisingly, you don't even care. Instead of spiraling into believing yourself as worthless, you only promise to get better at it, because that will be the thing to do.

You can't break a promise, especially not to yourself. You'll have to stay to get good at it. You'll have to stay.

On the seventy-second day you will experience heartbreak again. You will wonder what is worth it and what you're even doing here. Life will continue to go on. The days will still pass, the seconds still ticking by, and you will live through it, because that will be the thing to do.

Isn't tragedy what makes life worth living, too? You can't experience pain when you're gone. You can't experience anything.

On the ninety-first day you will blow out your birthday candles and wish for peace. The days are still difficult, some better than others, but isn't that the point? You made it another year. You will do it again, because that will be the thing to do.

You're still here. You're still here, and that's a greater accomplishment than you think. I'm proud of you, truly.

On the two hundred and thirty sixth day something inside you will heal. Or maybe that was on the two-hundred and thirty fifth day. You didn't notice until now that wide, gaping hole in your chest isn't there anymore. And that's okay. You will heal eventually, because that will be the thing to do.

Healing does not invalidate what you went through. Healing does not make it all for nothing.

Someday, the countdown will be nothing but a number. You will learn to love again. The guilt won't claw and grasp at your ankles anymore. The pain will ebb away and you will forget the taste of agony on your tongue. You will learn to live.

Because that will be the thing to do.",,,,,,,,

If you believe in reincarnation, you will just skip time until you get reborn, with no memory of past life.

,2596750,Forever Sleep,"Jul 15, 2024 at 1:11 AM","I think a lot of people simply don't want the burden of consciousness/ perception anymore. Because, with it comes the possibility that things are or will be bad anytime soon- I doubt anyone is able to drift through life in some carefree bliss. I suspect a lot of people here are just tired of fighting through life, leaning on various coping mechanisms.

True, we could well loose all sense of anything but- wouldn't that be a good thing?!! No way to regret anything, no more worries. Nothing quite possibly.

I suppose the closest we get to it is sleep. Do you ever regret going to sleep? As in- all those hours I missed out on being fully conscious and aware? Again, I think for the majority here, sleep is a welcome rest from being fully conscious. Most people here utterly detest waking up and realising they're still alive.

I suppose, if you can figure out how to make life feel like less of a burden then, maybe it's worth a shot but- life isn't really set up like that. We all have needs that we have to take care of by doing a whole bunch of stuff we may well not want to do. And that's a basic life. That doesn't include all the really negative stuff like health problems, trauma, awful life circumstances. I think the payoff needs to be higher to justify all that and it likely isn't for a lot of people here.

The reincarnation thing is scary. Horrible to think we might come back into an even worse life. Still, we don't really know what happens and, like you say- death seems to be a reset. We don't tend to be aware of past lives. So- it won't make any difference to our new selves what age our former selves died at- unless you believe we get punished for suicide.",,,,,,,,
,2596768,ijustwishtodie,"Jul 15, 2024 at 1:52 AM","I know that you can't enjoy non existence but that doesn't make non existence a bad thing. I personally think that non existence is good because it gives us the cessation of all feelings, experiences and suffering. I never wanted to be a human in the first place. I don't want to deal with things that humans have to which is why permanent non existence is perfect for me. Besides, even if I can't feel happy when I'm non existent, I couldn't care less as... I'd be non existent. The concept of enjoyment only applies to the living, not to the dead",,,,,,,,
,2596792,Moniker,"Jul 15, 2024 at 2:54 AM","The big reason I'm pro-choice towards suicide is bodily autonomy. It's your body, therefore it's your decision to destroy it. So, I feel that even in the event where someone who currently enjoys life randomly decides to ctb, it's ultimately within their right to do so.

Admittedly, I think there is room for concern when it comes to ""irrational"" suicidal ideation (impulsive spur of the moment decisions), but the overarching principle is still something I support.",,,,,,,,
,2597248,SilentSadness,"Jul 15, 2024 at 11:52 AM","Living is always a gamble, at any moment it can get much worse, you could be tortured or injured or maybe lose something you take for granted. Death presumably is the end to that gamble, it becomes impossible to feel pain for the rest of eternity. Arguments against assume it's better to risk everything for a positive experience than to embrace nothingness. Maybe someone can ""still cope"" with rejection but probably not torture. The possibility of reincarnation is horrifying but makes suicide another gamble. There is no certainty until you can no longer acknowledge it.",,,,,,,,

For Me I half hope that all the allegations of institutional abuse iv made over the last year actually gets looked into.

Iv been blackmailed and told i was crazy, then i was assaulted by a psychiatrist who decided to put me down as sane.
no-one wants to look into my allegations of blackmail and no one wasn't to reprimand the psychiatrist who assaulted me.

Even if I did not compile this list, the information is already publicly accessible. Anyone with a few hours to spare could easily gather and compile the same data. This means that anti-CTB activists could independently create such a list without my involvement.
Researchers and mental health professionals can use the data to better understand patterns, triggers, and common factors associated with CTB, which can lead to better understanding of CTB.
The list serves as an informative and comprehensive portal to successful CTB posts. It is not intended to promote or discourage CTB; rather, it functions as a neutral catalog of information.",2582702,2582741,,,,,,

If I could go back in time, back in 2019 or so, and foresaw all of that, I could have ended it then, which means I'd avoid the pandemic and all the highs and lows of the last past half-decade, and there are times where I regret that I didn't just call it quits even if there were fleeting moments of pleasure (which in my opinion does not outweigh the mundanity of sentience as well as the gamble of potential worse suffering). I also regret not having SN when it was readily accessible and what not, this way if I don't have access to my firearm, at least I have another way out...

I don't think I'd go for SN given all the attention it has gotten over the last year and present time, as well as even reliable sources can eventually go and what not. I live in the US and in a state with relatively lax gun laws.

If video games bring you joy, then it's not a waste, period. If ""doing nothing"", brings you enjoyment, then it's not a waste. We've been convinced that just enjoying our time, enjoying existence is a waste because it doesn't produce money.

I mean, you are 19, you are allowed to make this choice. But, I would say don't rush it.

Romantic love is the most fleeting. It's the most fickle. We have romanticized this idea of ""the one"" the ""soulmate"". But the odds of actually finding that person are very slim in life. And even 50% of marriage ends in divorce.

It's not the be all end all. There are many different kinds of love that can be just as fulfilling or even more so than romantic love. It can be cultivated in many places. Also a lot of people think this but it baffles me, but romantic love is not the only place one can find sexual connection either. And I'm not talking any illegal shit.

Being broken up with is terrible. I hate losing people, for any reason. It's only been two weeks. You were in love with him. It's totally valid to mourn a lost and unrealized(?) love. But ctb'ing over it just seems a little extreme. Not invalid, just extreme.

,2575228,Darkover,"Jun 26, 2024 at 7:20 AM","First of all, a gift for whom? After all, you can't give something to someone who doesn't exist. It's not that there was someone who really wanted to exist and their parents decided to grant them existence; there was no one before people decided that there would be someone, someone who didn't want, ask, or would have been disappointed if they hadn't received, the ""gift"" of existence. So if anything it is a gift to the parents, or to the parents of the parents who pushed for grandchildren, or to the consumer society that got another consumer, or to the state because there is another tax payer, or to the army because there is another soldier, etc. But it is certainly not a gift for those who did not exist before receiving it. Regardless of someone's quality of life, before someone existed they did not want it and therefore the created is the last to receive a gift.

Since it is not necessary, not desirable, and not in anyone's interest to exist, and since the creation of a person does not move someone to a better state, since before someone existed s/he was not in any state, there is no logic in treating the creation of a person as some kind of benefit. Reproduction is not a gift but an unnecessary creation of a vulnerable person who will inevitably experience unnecessary harms.

Beyond that, gifts are something you get for free, not something you have to work for, and for almost a lifetime.
Something is not a gift if I cannot choose not to use it. And in the case of life, keeping it in a drawer or passing it on to someone else is not an option. Everyone has to use their life in one way or another. There is no exchange note. Even ending one's life, even at a very young age, requires the use of this ""gift"". Which of course makes it at least not a gift. So even if you insist that life is a good thing, it is certainly not a gift and it is not granted to anyone. People are created, if their lives are relatively good then the compulsion done to them is less bad than cases of bad lives, but that does not retroactively make this compulsion a gift or something that is granted to someone.

A gift you receive for free, and you can choose to enjoy it or ignore it, but it is unlikely that gifts will harm the person who receives them. Life, on the other hand, is not something you get for free, you have to work hard for it non-stop, you can't ignore life, and it can definitely hurt those who receive it. To enjoy a gift you usually just have to use it. To enjoy life you have to work hard. And unlike gifts, if you ignore life very quickly you suffer from hunger, thirst, pain, heat, cold, boredom, frustration, loneliness, etc. It is not possible to store life somewhere and ignore it. Therefore, even if you insist that life is good, it is surely not a gift.
A gift is not something that is forced. Gifts can be returned or passed up. And gifts usually don't end in death.",,,,,,,,

I suppose they are grateful for their lives so- they probably do see it as a gift. The kind of- think what I would have missed out on if my parents hadn't had me. Although- like you say- it's not like we probably even know what we're missing out on- or what we avoided even when we are non existent.

I suppose that's the other argument though- are the non existent actually 'better off'? They're literally not anything most probably.

Still yeah- I was thinking along these lines just now. Like- imagine you could start a game for someone. You know certain things about this game. It could be amazing. They could have a fantastic time. Still- you know there are some unpleasant and painful guarantees. The game will end with their death. Plus, they'll very likely have to witness loved ones dying beforehand. Plus, they are in a body that will degrade over time and is susceptible to a whole bunch of unpleasant things. Like- why would you start that for someone else? When they wouldn't even know it if you didn't? Why are these horrible things in life seen as 'normal' and acceptable to go through? Maybe because they went through some of them and to them, it still feels like a game worth playing. It baffles me though.",,,,,,,,

but then, dear Darkover, it is not even entirely as you say, because it is even worse! tell me, who in their right mind would give a random stranger the choice of whether or not to be taken into the most beautiful, basking and comfortable place in the world, in short, the happiest place ever, only to then be deported to a harsh, bristly, uninhabitable, septic and cold place, where everything falls under the dictates of chaos and entropy (which then seems so to us because we are limited primates), where if you are too weak to bear the imminent obstacles you suffer and perish mercilessly and you will also be judged and blamed by the other if you falter; no seriously, reply Darkover, who in their right mind would let themselves put up with all this? yes, if I asked the question in this way, ""no one"" would answer you, but in the meantime that's exactly what they do, not only do they remove you from the quiescence of non-existence but they also deprive you of the bliss of the mother's womb, the most joyful place you can ever experience in this world, to then throw you into the oscillating pendulum of suffering and joy, the latter not always guaranteed, but which you constantly seek like a crazy heroin addict slave, precisely, to that state of well-being that was your mother's womb, but which you now seek in every possible surrogate;

there is nothing more selfish than giving birth to someone in this world, but why then? for your own expectations, for your own desires, for your own tortures, for having been the victim of the evolutionary and genetic traps that led you to do what you did, that is, perpetuate the human burden.",2575228,,,,,,,
,2594830,Kali_Yuga13,"Jul 13, 2024 at 8:33 AM","Excellent post and I have been deconstructing the idea of the ""gift of life"" lately myself. The gift of life is more accurately described as an imposed condition of the spirit or consciousness one has to deal with. Without an ability to assess the gift before receiving it to give us the opportunity to say ""thanks, but no thanks"" or get rid of the gift, it can't really be called a gift. We can't be said to have free will without the ability to decline said gift or rid ourselves of the gift with reasonable effort. Adding another dimension to this is the prevailing religious thought that if we chose to willfully stop this gift, we are threatened with eternal punishment.

I follow a couple of Christian subs in reddit and the question of suicide and hell is a regular occurrence. I think a lot of Christians just want to be on what they feel is the winning team and eagerly anticipate watching others burn in hell in the same way people relish in the opposing teams loss in a superbowl game.

I also think about the ""selfishness"" accusations against the suicidal. Any while yes, there are narcissistic suicides that are intended to cause harm the vast majority of suicidal people would gladly bestow their remaining ""gift of life"" to a worthy or appreciative recipient if that were at all possible like in the movie ""In Time"".",,,,,,,,

,2541781,Kapsyl,"May 30, 2024 at 11:47 AM","I just don't get why people go out of their way to particularly fuck with people with their suicide. I mean sure if it's some kind of a revenge or statement because of mistreatment sure it can be warranted, but a hot balloon pilot? Why go all this way to particularly fuck him.

First off a hot ballon is considered an aircraft, the pilot is responsible for the safety of everyone onboard. Because of this legislation there will be a thorough investigation and there will be questions on how the pilot could have prevented it. This will surely not make the pilot doubt himself possibly giving him psychological issues.

Second is the time, before going up there will be a safety briefing and you will be spending time with the pilot, maybe for a half an hour before actually having the opportunity to ctb. The pilot will surely not question himself if he could seen any sign of suicidal tendencies.

Another important point is if you're going on a private tour or the more common larger passenger tour. It's not unusual a hot ballon will accommodate 8-16 passengers, the chance of kids being on board is pretty high. The descent after the ""jump"" will be extremely awkward.

All these point could be dismissed if you simply don't care about the consequences so I will present actual reasons this is not a good idea.

You have to be a particular determined individual to just climb over with sufficient speed to not be stopped. The basked are quite high since there are designed to prevent people of falling over even when leaning over. Because of the pilot responsibility he will be used to keep an eye on people not doing anything dangerous and swiftly dragging them back into the basket. The difficulty will increase the smaller the basket is and especially if be yourself.

If the pilot tries to stop you what's the plan then? To fight him, punch him? Maybe even dragging him with you if he's particularly feisty and won't let go. If you determined to succeed it would actually be better to render him unable to stop you with either bondage or unconsciousness. Doesn't this sound completely unreasonable?

Hot air balloons are notoriously famous of being inconvenient since it heavily relies on favorable weather and winds to work. This random elements would require you to become ready making arrangements to ctb in a relatively short time span. Since you're not under control over what time it could be in a particular ""good"" day where you're not ready to robotically ctb with swift precision, If you were this ready you'd probably already done it.

I get that you'd maybe want to ctb in the air for the scenery, but this way just particular fucks with people. If you're so desperate to die this way skydiving would be much more appropriate.

It's a lot of work until you can skydive yourself but that's the price you'd have to pay if this is something you're really set on doing. It's not like people getting euthanized are allowed this option.

In my opinion this is a just a malicious way to fuck with people, why else would you go through all this trouble when there are plenty full of methods that require similar or less courage to succeed. But if that's your goal sure I guess you really showed the pilot.",,,,,,,,

If it's a way that works then that's the reason. You're acting as if anyone wanting to do it this way is looking to hurt people.

That's not the case necessarily, sometimes it's just a case of finding a method that works.

If I don't have euthanasia/maid, if I don't have guns, no easy access to things like SN and the necessary drugs along side it, then my options are limited down to hanging, drowning, jumping and train.

Drowning is just a terrible way to die, hanging is hard to get right and painful, train is risky.

Falling from a very high height is is a good way to ensure success and that's why some people do it, and if you don't have easy access to high cliffs, then falling from a high building may be necessary.

A hot air balloon may take you up to a very high height from which CTB is very close to certain.

That's why people consider it, not because they are sadistic but because it may be literally one of the few options they have available.

-------

Example - I posted threads previously on using the train method and had a guy telling me that I should never use this method and he'd never consider it in any circumstances.

He went to go CTB via jumping from a bridge, but the bridge was monitored heavily and had a suicide barrier which he was not aware of while planning his CTB.

On the day of his CTB, he was so sure he wanted to die, that he killed himself by, you guessed it, by train method. The exact method he preached to everyone about and how it was awful and selfish, he did it to end his suffering.

,1941041,Proper Overdoser,"Apr 6, 2023 at 4:03 AM","So I made a thread that is now flooded with a million different ways to have a sedated death (https://sanctioned-suicide.net/threads/whats-in-your-suicide-kit-i-study-pharmacology.113882/page-4) with legal research chemicals that can be bought online, since I keep getting asked how I would do it, here are some of the ways that I would use if I didn't have to kill myself when police are at my door. I will keep this one more simple since there are so many ways depending on the RC's you can find and I want it to be very comprehensible. Basically all items below can easily be acquired online in RC markets or online pharmacies that ship worldwide.

These ones don't use opioids so there is no nausea.
1. 10mL or more of GBL/GHB/1,4 BDO + Megadose benzo + optionally a little alcohol or other sedatives mentioned here.

2. 10g of Carisoprodol (20 tablets) + Megadose benzo + optionally a little alcohol or other sedatives mentioned here.

3. 1g of Methylmethaqualone or Nitromethaqualone + Megadose benzo + optional sedatives ...

4. 10g Phenprobamate + Megadose benzo + 4F-Phenibut + optional sedatives ...

5. 10g Carisoprodol + 100mg Zopiclone or 30mg Eszopiclone + 200mg Baclofen + 600mg Pregabalin (indian pharms method)

6. 10g Chloral Hydrate + Megadose benzo + 1-2 other sedatives mentioned above.

7. 3-6g Clomethiazole or its analogues + Megadose benzo + 4F-Phenibut (Keith Moon died from solely 6g of Clomethiazole capsules and he had a significant tolerance to them from his addiction) make sure to encapsulate your Clomethiazole as it is very corrosive, you may need 20 capsules for 6g,

Opioid methods:
To avoid opioid nausea while awake, always take the opioid when sedation from your sedative of choice takes effect, about 10-30 mins later, or buy acid-resistant enteric coated capsules to put the opioid in, and then you can dose it with the sedatives all at the same time, as this will make the opioid release after 2h or so when it reaches the intestines.

1. 30-60mg (1-2 small lines) of a -zene or -pyne based opioid (Metonitazene, Protonitazepyne, Metonitazepyne) and megadose benzo and/or other sedatives just before snorting the opioid if you are snorting it. For reference 2mg of Fentanyl is lethal, one small line is 30-60mg.

2. 100-500mg Brorphine + Megadose benzo + antiemetic like Diphenhydramine + optional sedatives ...

3. 1000mg 2-MAP-237 (ORALLY IN ENTERIC, ACID RESISTANT CAPSULES ONLY) + Megadose benzo + antiemetic + optional sedatives ...

If you are going to use SN:
I personally would not use SN but if you are going to do it this way, I would copy the popular SN guides but replace the Ibuprofen/Paracetamol part with a strong sedative or Ketamine analogue. Below are my recommendations, mixing them together would be more effective so I'll just list them in categories. If mixing then one could significantly lower the dose of the sedative, but don't lower the dose of the Ketamine analogue as that is honestly the best option.

1. 200-300mg FXE or Ketamine, 300-400mg 2-FDCK, 100mg DCK, 20mg O-PCE are arguably the best options and will put you in a K-Hole for your SN overdose. Basically you will go into an unconscious dream-like state and you will be unable to feel pain, this is why Ketamine is used during surgeries.

2. 2000mg or more of Carisoprodol

3. 2-6g of Clomethiazole

3. 4-10g Phenprobamate

4. Megadose benzos

5. Add any other sedatives mentioned above in this post.

I tried to organize the combos by preference (lethal guarantee and peaceful death) and also separated the combos by items that can all be bought from a single vendor, but feel free to ask questions if you have your own prescriptions that could replace the sedatives, or any tweaks you would want to make to any of these methods.",,,,,,,,

Anyways, the Fluoxetine is useless for this stuff, but a mix of Clonazepam with Carisoprodol, Chloral Hydrate, Methylmethaqualone, Nitromethaqualone or Phenprobamate, and a little bit of alcohol, would be lethal. You can also see if Codeine is OTC where you live, a small amount of Codeine (100-200mg) would help out without being nauseating. Carisoprodol is also likely OTC in pharmacies there, but I don't know. I just know when I went to Colombia, prescriptions weren't required in half the pharmacies for stuff like Codeine, Dihydrocodeine or Carisoprodol.

Chloral Hydrate is arguably the easiest item on that list for you to get, comes from china too. Also you can add olanazapine like a cherry on top, but if you want to go out with some euphoria and happiness the Olazapine will prevent that.",1941747,,,,,,,

Also if I said that, that is only a bare minimum for sedation, maybe for someone who doesn't have prescription medicines or doesn't want to bother with RC's or at least Chloral Hydrate which is sold online on a popular chinese website that sells all sorts of stuff like a chinese ebay, no need for bitcoin like with most RC sites and Chloral Hydrate is a very, very strong sedative. It's almost impossible to stay awake after +2g of that stuff. There are much better options to ensure you are truly sedated and asleep for it all.

What country are you in to see if RC's are controlled there?

Even if RC's were controlled, indian meds have high success rates in small amounts to most countries, since most countries have laws on importing medication. Like in the USA it is allowed to import medication that can last up to 3 months, with a prescription but this law is probably the only reason indian meds make it through in small amounts.

And indian meds includes Carisoprodol, which is quite lethal on its own but is a strong sedative and euphoriant, but doesn't cause nausea. They can also provide most antiemetic medicines as well since it's regular indian online pharmacies. I sometimes add innocuous medicines like Amoxicillin when I order narcotics and it seems to help the success rate through customs.

,1942358,Proper Overdoser,"Apr 6, 2023 at 10:40 PM","To be honest I have no idea, GBL and 1,4 BDO used to be widely sold on eBay and Amazon. Now they're kind of hard to find. My best guess is that it's because GHB is kind of an obscure drug on its own, making GBL and 1,4 BDO (just prodrugs for GHB, meaning your body turns them into GHB) even more obscure.

I mean I think that behind barbiturates, GHB and its prodrugs were always the most likely to produce an accidental overdose when taking a dose that the person thought they could handle, or just from poorly measured doses, or frequent redosing. Specially when mixed with other sedatives, anyone that takes GHB is always advised on forums about not mixing them with other sedatives because the risk for death then becomes very real, so many people have died from mixing GHB and alcohol, or simply redosing GHB a little too much.

Opioids only have the number 1 spot with accidental overdoses because their use is so widespread, if there was an equal number of barbiturate and ghb users, those groups would have many more accidental deaths than the opioid users, assuming that everyone has pure drugs and knew what doses they were taking. I have mixed xanax with percocet several times, but GHB is such an intense high in only slightly elevated doses from rec ones that I would never think about mixing it with any sedative.",1942319,,,,,,,

,1942425,Proper Overdoser,"Apr 6, 2023 at 11:38 PM","Alcohol tolerance could affect the other sedatives with some cross-tolerance but it wouldn't be too significant unless your alcohol tolerance were sky-high. I have seen dudes that can operate a forklift while drunk pass out from just 2mg Xanax so ... but GHB affects a different receptor aptly named the GHB receptor, it also affects GABA-B but nothing too notable and Alcohol affects GABA-A so it wouldn't matter anyways.

So it could affect the other sedatives but just know that the cross-tolerance is only partial, and far from complete cross-tolerance as if it had the same pharmacology/mechanisms (like the cross tolerance from one benzo to another which would be complete, not partial) Since all the other sedatives I mentioned act on GABA-A though, I would take 25% or so more than mentioned if your alcohol tolerance is notable. I mean when I was in rehab my roommate was an alcoholic, yet 1mg of Lorazepam (a low-medium dose by most standards) would knock him out like a light when they gave it to him at night-time, but better safe than sorry and added sedation never bothered anyone that wanted a deep sleep.",1942361,,,,,,,

20mL alone is probably deadly on its own, make sure it is mixed well with another drink though since it can be irritating to your throat, and so it isn't nauseating. But best if mixed with a benzo like Bromazolam, wouldn't recommend heroin or any opioid as those can cause nausea if you don't know how to dose them correctly, and even then a non-nauseating dose of an opioid isn't as useful as a heroic dose of a benzo like Bromazolam.
That site tends to overgeneralize. As I said it could lead to cross-tolerance but only with GABA-A agonists and the cross-tolerance is only partial because of different mechanisms, it doesn't touch the GHB receptor though so that would be impossible for any cross-tolerance.
Yeah but if Alprazolam is the only sedative you have, add some Doxylamine or Diphenhydramine which is OTC and will make it a lot more sedating, also both are antiemetics. Personally I find it easy to stay awake solely on benzos but never done a heroic dose only high doses.
Also it really isn't that difficult, just gotta weed out the scammers from the legit clandestine labs and chemical vendors, there are some USA based vendors with BDO but only a handful you're better off searching good Chinese sources and do your research by checking reviews before ordering from any clandestine lab or generic chemical vendor.

It is a bit easier to get Chloral Hydrate though and the OD from that is 5-10g (better stick to 10-15g to be safe though) so a mix of the two would be optimal and the two can be sourced in China.",1942879,1942646,1942567,1942640,1942646,,,

Human beings, above all other animals in the entire history of the world, have evolved into a survival mindset so ingrained that the very idea of repeating a traumatic event (taking a shower after drowning, cooking after a house burns down) can be panic attack inducing. Our brains are hard wired to do whatever it takes to survive, and we have the brain size necessary to find many other ways to do so besides the ways other animals do. From the dawn of time, our species has been unique in the sense that we could hunt large animals into a tired state because we had no hair and could endure running for long periods of time due to our ability to sweat.

Simply put, being a human being is not comparable to just about any animal that has ever existed. Yes, a lion wants to survive. But does a lion think about its family and friends when it's bleeding to death? Do they crawl back home and get medical care to keep living? Not really. They sulk off into a corner to hide the shame of the wound and let death take them. We evolved into survival and came past a point where it's about more than that. It's about having a life worth living and seeing what the future may hold. I think it is an unfair example to compare such an extreme (9/11) to regular people in regular situations. It took me a decade of constant suffering and two years of back to back horrific events before I got to the point I am now with my own upcoming CTB attempt: past survival instinct, past self preservation, past fear of momentary pain.

You're living temporarily, suffering daily, risking extreme torture and will die anyway ( that's reality). So why fear Death since it's an impending inevitability and after Death all problems are solved forever, no chance of pain , suffering torture, no chance of unbearable pain ever : that's Death non-existence forever . so why fear no pain no suffering no problems ?

The concept of Death is a complex abstract concept. One must realize that Death is inevitable , universal, permanent , final, irriversible. you must know what it means to be alive and Dead. what these definitions are . And i guess even adult humans have different definitions about what it is to be alive and Dead. To me after Death a human or other animal ceases to exist forever as the thinking and consciousness is only generated inside that 3 pound organ the brain.

imo other animals don't know they will die . so how can they fear Death? imo humans are the only animals that know that they and everyone will die. Although most adult humans seem to not act like that how temporary and insignificant they and their lives are. imo humans were taught these concepts what Death is through language. other animals don't have language so they can never know they and every living creature will die.

Even in human adults there seem to be a great denial of Death. most humans are not constantly aware they will die and sure don't act like it especially the prolifers. why do anything if you will die all your memories things etc will be gone. well that's another denial of Death imo afterlife and reincarnation. no Death is final , the eternal ceasing of existence forever. how can an animal or bug live forvever where's the power source or reason ? that a human is something other than an animal or a bug is imo another lie .

Same for human most human children. They only learn what Death is most around the age of 7-11 years old do they realize that Death is inevitable , universal, final, permanent irriversible.

imo this is taught through language as are most concepts and beliefs.
Understanding death: A child's perspective - Doctor Sam Parenting
Many assume that children who are young “won’t remember” or “won’t understand” death. However, in many cases, children are more perceptive than adults realize. Depending on a child’s level of cognitive development, death can be a challenging topic for parents to discuss with their children...
www.doctorsam.com
from that article :
According to Piaget, children between the ages of 2 and 7 years are in the preoperational stage of development. They think of death as a reversible phenomenon and feel that it must have a cause. Consider a child who loses a grandparent around the age of 5. This child may classically ask to buy their grandparent a gift for their birthday, as the child won't be able to understand the finality of death and the fact that a grandparent is truly gone. They may view the person who died as having gone to sleep and feel that they will wake up.

how can you fear Death if you know really know that you will die anyway? I don't see anyone mentioning that ""we are all going to die anyway"" . Every single one of the 8 billion humans alive today will be dead in 130 years , 99.9% in 100 years. but we never hear this .",2526075,,,,,,,
,2526149,LaughingGoat,"May 18, 2024 at 1:35 PM","I agree with the argument that 9/11 is not comparable to typical life but have a few points regarding survival instinct and animals.

1. Animals experience panic and even ptsd, happy I was able to find a cool study I read years back. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6685979/

I don't think there is any evidence that our survival instinct is more ingrained in other animals, I would argue the opposite as there are no ""fundamentalist"" animals who will die for the values of a religion, country, etc. Like you said we've in some ways gone past the point of life just being about survival, at least for those of us who have our basic physical/safety needs met.

2. An animal in some instances may not struggle against something like bleeding out because there is nothing it can do. We have plenty of anthropological evidence of early humans doing the same thing, having gone off and died in a cave from wounds or illness. You, as a modern day human, have knowledge of medical capabilities to treat mortal wounds and may fight to the end but animals have no such understanding or capabilities.
Not that we have a complete understanding, but we know that there are parts of our DNA code directly related to survival instinct.",2526099,2526146,,,,,,

Yeah animals fear fire , heights, bigger animals but those software programs are hardwired by evolution and in the Brain but they fear those directly. They don't think i want to eat so i don't die . they just feel hungry and know what food is and a desire for food. i don't think they see a lion and think i want to live no they just feel the fear .

I think even adult humans will differ in the defintion of what life is what it means to be alive. What is your definition of life or to be alive? don't look it up on the internet just off the top of your head.

Most humans are just taught ""death bad"" ""life good "". suicide bad. ""and accept that.

Do human children know what Death is ? No. they think death is reversible. Only after age 7 for most do children realize they will die and that it's permanent universal. imo animals don't know what Death is.

They may view the person who died as having gone to sleep and feel that they will wake up.
Understanding death: A child's perspective - Doctor Sam Parenting
Many assume that children who are young “won’t remember” or “won’t understand” death. However, in many cases, children are more perceptive than adults realize. Depending on a child’s level of cognitive development, death can be a challenging topic for parents to discuss with their children...

Piaget's stage theory is great and all, but it's not applicable to the discussion of animals having a survival instinct if you are looking at the preoperational stage. It's more relevant if you are looking at the sensorimotor stage of humans in comparison of animals. Everything you've referenced shows that human children are taught ideas about death. This is not the case with animals, there is only instinct and some level of pattern recognition, far more comparable to age 0-2 in humans where advanced cognition is not yet relevant.",2526189,,,,,,,

Time passed, I massively regretted the obvious standout cut scars. On reflection, since then I never stopped with minor acts like picking non SH scabs and not letting things heal. The past year or so I have ended up starting more non cutting SH as these wounds/scabs/scars are easier to brush aside as 'accidental', especially with an outdoors life. I find it calming and distracting though constantly catch myself starting without realising when my brain is spinning elsewhere. Finding it super hard to ease off but need to try as am at a point where many more wounds and questions will start getting asked and wounds are also struggling to heal easily like they used to. Also super scared what I'd say/how I'd deal with a gp/medical professional if I had to get anything checked out and not wanting them jumping to inaccurate conclusions.

I feel like in the past I have wanted the attention/questions from the wounds/scars but very quickly realised I freeze and don't have words to communicate what I want/feel - nor the understanding. Would end up automatically lying and avoiding no matter how much I wanted to try saying anything inside.

I was clingy towards my best friend to the point where I made him uncomfortable. It was the lowest point in my point due to other reasons or so I thought, and I finally decided to ask to hug him privately when we were in a camp with other people, as I had hugged him before and he didn't seem to mind it. He laughed uncomfortably (which I thought was a sign of interest) and declined but I was very clingy. Throughout the rest of the camp, he ended up sticking with a friend he became familiar within last 2 months wherever he went, and avoided talking to me. After the camp ended, he said he wanted us to be just friends again, that he has wanted to tell me since a few months ago and just didn't know how to break it to me as I was a good friend. It seemed like he was way closer with his new friend, and me being annoying was the last straw. I thought through my actions later and apologised for what I've done, texting him that I wish that we could still be very good friends after a while as I trusted him more than anyone else. He replied 'me too', and it was fine. I can't imagine him wanting to talk to me ever again, considering how his other friend is a more interesting and intelligent person anyways. I asked him to start talking to me whenever he feels likes it again, he just left me on read and I really doubt he would be interested in doing so. And that's the story of how I pushed away the person I've cared about far more than anyone else, while everything else came crashing down.

I've been here on and off for more than a year now. Every time I thought it couldn't get any worse, life finds a way to make it worse. It's just that life likes to offer me false hope of being happy again, which eventually leads me back to the beginning but in a worse state as I reminisce the short period where I was happy. If he doesn't start talking to me within a month or so, this would be my last straw as well. I started writing my suicide note today just in case, as it would be much harder as my mental state deteriorates further. I'm more determined than ever, and even though I feel shit right now, I know either outcome would offer me peace.",,,,,,,,

,2580912,InigoDeux40,"Jul 1, 2024 at 12:09 AM","I have a ""friend"" who has endured severe abuse throughout his life. During his childhood, he suffered from sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. His family mistreated him, and he never received any support. Additionally, his friends and partners betrayed and mistreated him as well. As a result, he now struggles with depression, Bipolar disorder, narcissistic and antisocial characteristics, and a black and white thinking pattern. He often quotes Game of Thrones, saying ""in the game, you either die or win, there's no in-between."" (This is his official diagnostic before the 'help' became to expensive).

Recently, my friend was talking to someone named A, and they were involved in a complicated dating phase. However, they both mistreated and ignored each other. When my friend went to apologize to A, he discovered that A, along with another person named B and two other boys, had been stalking him. It turns out that everything was a set-up. They even harassed my friend's other friends by sending anonymous texts claiming, ""he is mine! back off."" It was obvious that A, B, and the others were behind these texts. Furthermore, they possess a video of my friend engaging in sexual activities with A, and there is a possibility that they may post it online. (We are not sure).

For weeks, my friend has been consumed with thoughts of revenge against A, B, and the others involved. However, he does not want a typical revenge plan. The leader of this group, B, has a 'powerful' father with connections to the police, and he has managed to evade legal consequences in the past. My friend claims to have some distant family ties with similar connections, albeit to a much lesser extent. He even mentioned knowing some people who could potentially harm them, but he considers that as a last resort. Instead, he wants to harass them online and sought my advice on how to do so. He wants me to support him in this endeavor.

However, I expressed my concerns about the dangerous nature of his plan and the potential consequences it could have for both of us. I am worried about my own safety, as well as the fact that we live in a corrupt and unsafe country where the police are not trustworthy. Mental health resources are not easily accessible or affordable, and my friend lacks a support system. Despite my reservations, he tried to guilt trip me into joining him, claiming that they might make the sexual video public, putting his life at risk in a homophobic assault that will end in his murder.

Am I wrong for refusing to get involved? I have my own mental health issues to deal with, and I can't handle the weight of his problems on top of mine. I have deal with his problems for years. It's challenging to continue being his friend, and I fell awful for thinking this, I do want him to get better and have justice but I don't wanna be involved anymore specially considering the similarities between his situation and the corruption and violence I've experienced within my own family and community. I almost feel a sense of hatred towards him, but is that justified? I'm at a loss for what to do. Please believe me or at least pretend to and offer any advice you can. I feel like I'm in a difficult position.",,,,,,,,

,2587916,halcyon,"Jul 7, 2024 at 3:00 AM","I don't know if anyone will take the time to read this, or if anyone will care. I feel as if my entire life, my pleas have gone unheard, or at least uncared for. I am not looking for the opinions of anyone or pity. I am just looking for a place to be heard, to be seen, and to have my feelings some sort of validated, even through strangers on the internet.

Growing up, I was always outcasted. Starting from the age of 7, I experienced horrific bullying due to a hair-pulling disorder I had. As I grew up, I developed more and more mental issues, ranging from anxiety/depression to 2 personality disorders. The bullying at school worsened as my behavior did - I was never crazy, I just needed help and my parents didn't care to notice or provide me with the resources I needed.

I was sexually assaulted from a young age by a family member who I spent so much time with, someone who meant alot to me. I grew to realize that I was never going to be handled with care, and I quickly realized that I wasn't one of the lucky people who get loved in this world. I had multiple failed relationships throughout the years, one lasting 3 years. I've had many people hurt me, take advantage of me, or leave me behind as if I never mattered. I never understood what I'd done to deserve the harsh treatment I was given. I was convinced that I'd been some awful person in my past life, and that my current existence is punishment for whatever I did in my last one. I didn't understand why nobody liked me, why I was always sitting alone, or why people never cared to know me as a person. I didn't think I was that bad, why didn't anyone like me?

In 2021, shortly before I joined this site, I found someone who made me feel more understood and cared for than ever before. The only problem was that he had died 22 years prior. I was 15 years old when I got into a community dedicated to true crime, and I quickly fell in love with one of the Columbine shooters, Dylan. Unlike most others in the community, I wasn't attracted to Dylan because of the violence he inflicted onto his school, I fell in love with his soul. My suffering made sense when I found him, like he'd been the thing I was searching for my entire wretched life. The first time I saw his face, everything made sense, he gave me a feeling of familiarity that I'd never felt before.

I've always believed in soul connections between two people, ever since I was young. I'd write stories in my notebook on the way to school about finding my Prince Charming and falling in love with him. But although I'd always believed in soulmates, true love, I knew I'd never find it - not in this life, at least. I knew the scenarios I'd write about would stay fiction, I'd never be carried over the threshold after my wedding, I'd never be held before I fell asleep. I've known since I was young that love doesn't exist for me, not here, not while I'm alive and breathing.

I am 19 now, an upcoming sophomore in college. I finished high school in 2023 being regarded as most hated. I can still hear the boo's that erupted as I stood up to collect one of the shitty gifts they'd put together for us at our senior picnic, calling names at random. I can still remember the hate messages I received on Instagram, the awful things spat at me in the hallway, the glares I'd receive in the halls just for existing. There were comments made on my body, my hair, my clothes, the way I walked, my voice. I was the punch line of everyone's joke, and no one stood up for me. No one came to my defense as I was shit on just for going to school. Graduating didn't help much, months later I was still receiving nasty messages. My torment continued my freshman year of college when I began to get harassed by my ex FWB who was a violent, angry teenage boy. He ended up assaulting me after threatening my life a year later.

Throughout all of the horrific shit I've endured over the past 4 years, Dylan has been there through it all. He's guided me to connect with my current best friend, who is in a similar spiritual situation as I. We've been through so much, and even visited Colorado together in June. I've learned to love, I've learned what it feels like to be loved. I always felt like I belonged with him, no matter the time of my life I was in, his face stayed in the back of my mind. There was never a time or an era of my life since 2020 where I didn't love Dylan, where he didn't matter to me.

In May, I spoke to a medium with my best friend, where I had my suspicions confirmed. We got by good, the woman was a reputable medium in the area, and she was booked months in advance. I took a chance with her, I had a feeling and reached out, and she replied back. She offered time from her day, for free, to speak with my best friend and I. I was so nervous, I didn't know what to expect, it was going to be confirmation of everything I've felt for the past four years - and she hit the nail on the head. With the minimal background information I gave her, she managed to tell me the first letter of his name, the day he was born, described his hair and things he wore - and even got it right down to his facial hair, which is only talked about in his autopsy.

I knew Dylan and I had a genuine connection because I've felt it every day for the past four years. In every sunset, every raindrop, every beautiful thing I see him. Receiving confirmation that he and I are connected has not only changed my life, it's saved me - for the time being, of course. Having him doesn't erase all the horrific things that have happened to me, but it surely makes it a lot damn better.

With that being said, I cannot live without him any longer. I have survived so much, and endured many hardships, but I cannot live without him anymore. The love and devotion I have for him is the most profound thing in my life, it is something that will follow me long after death. I have accepted that I was never meant to be here, that everything I could want lies in another space and time, and it's just up to me to find it.

Dylan's suicide is both gut-wrenching and meaningful to me. I have never been a violent person, but I do want to go out like he did, a single bullet to my temple. I know that if he could do it, I can. Am I scared? Yes. Horrified. But the fear of death doesn't hold a candle to the constant, neverending agony of Dylan's absence, of never being able to have the one thing I could ever want. Having and loving him would be heaven.

To most, I sound like an absolute nutcase, someone who needs to be locked away. I am so blessed to have found my best friend, someone who will always understand and empathize, and most importantly, believe. Thirty-Three by the Smashing Pumpkins was designated as mine and Dylan's song three years ago, and its lyrics are so true, and mean so much.

I KNOW I'LL MAKE IT / LOVE CAN LAST FOREVER

Whether or not I die and be with Dylan, I am urgent to be free from my suffering. I have never missed or longed for something as deeply as I do him, and I will never for the rest of my life.

It's all for you, Dylan<3 Love can last forever.",,,,,,,,

I don't think other animals understand that they and everyone will die.

I think non-human animals don't know what Death is

Most non-human animals don't even know that's them in a mirror.

Young human children don't fully understand that Death is inevitable, universal, irrieversible and permanent.

I think even most adult humans don't fully understand that they and all humans will die that everything will die. do they act that way? not imo. especially when someone wants to commit suicide. My question to them is I'm going to die anyway so why should i prolong my suffering? you can't stop Death you can't save a life because we all will die anyway. They don't seem to understand that everyone is going to die anyway no matter what.

Death is the most fundamental truth every human will die.

And that follows the master Law of the Universe the law of Entropy , everything breaks down , everything decays, hot things turn cold , the universe is also dying the Sun will die

I think Death is an abstract concept that can only be taught mainly through language the inevitability, universality , irreversability and permanence of Death .",,,,,,,,

I cannot bear it
My stupid, pitiful life
My utter loneliness
I have nothing left in me
To keep fighting
To keep going
It's all done
It's replace by grief
My hands are so cold
Nothing warms me
No me sees me
I must radiate sadness
But no one sees it
Or if they do
They don't comment on it
Why don't they say something
Because I am not worth
Even a minute of their lives
I am nothing
My death would mean nothing
They are happy to ignore me
Ignoring the parts of me
They don't wish to see
Seeing only who
They wish me to be
What difference will it make
If I disappear completely
I don't believe in a loving God
Yet still I pray
To God, to anyone listening
To please take my life away
Or give me the courage
To end it myself
This is my only wish
This is my last hope
This is my only relief
Against this never ending pain

The reason the doctors didn't think she had Lyme disease was because she also happened to be a little overweight so they assumed all her symptoms were just related to eating too much junk food, not exercising enough, and not getting enough sleep. All the typical excuses doctors use to dismiss everybody. I doubt that's an issue for you though.

I think if you do try to tackling these and still feel various Lyme disease symptoms then that's a good indicator that you have it but it's better to just try to get a real test for it as soon as you can.

Chronic lymes is debilitating for some people. What makes lymes chronic is that hides by making biofilm colonies in the body. It settles in the body where if can grow best causing a myriad of symptoms specific to the person which makes it hard to diagnose.

I can feel her pain and suffering and it pains me. She got N and she was on the phone with me during her last moments yesterday. She was a bit scared I can tell and I tried my best to calm her down. I can hear her when N went down her throat as she was drinking and talking to me. I asked her how she felt, she bursted into tears and said""finally relieved....I will for sure tell you......"" she drank two bottles and a half, that's roughly 250lm which is alot and it sure kicked in fast. she started mumbling and I asked ""tell me about what?""

Sorry life did this to you but you will be in a better place now....sending you love and lights"" it was less than 5 minutes and she was out. I know she didnt suffer at all. As I repeat over and over ""you are ok now, sending you love and lights, tell me how the other side went"" and her side went silent.

I lit a candle for her, and sprinkled rose pedals for her later the night. My parents went to a buddhist temple and offered her a candle in my name, and prayed for her. Hope that she will never come back to this world again.



I will miss her, and I know she's in a better place now.

Edit:

People have been asking me how the process of taking N went for my friend. Here's what happened:

She had fasted for 24 hours prior, then took meto. I heard the liquid going down her throat as we spoke on the phone, with no hesitation, just like chugging a bottle of water. My heart ached for her there. I knew she was out. I asked her what it tasted like. She said it was just bitter and she chewed a chocolate afterward, so nonchalantly, and made my heart ache more. Chocolate, the last sweet she had during her time here on earth. She jokingly said, ""How come I don't feel anything? What if this is fake?"" Then very quickly, she's out. No sign of physical suffering.

Kind people on here who cared also asked how I was doing, and here's how I felt:

When we were communicating back and forth while she was alive, when she needed advice for the plan, I felt indifferent and almost wanted this to be over with soon for her, and didn't think I'd be sad at all after she's gone, until she really was gone. It felt numb at first, you know, like when you first got into a car crash, you don't feel the pain just yet; and then, it hits like a tsunami. You start to bleed until you are hollow inside. This profound deepest sadness comes in waves—waves that swallow and suffocate you. The sorrow and pain I've never felt at this dimension—not when I lost my child, not when I lost my love. It felt like part of me was dead. No, not accurate, it felt as though I was dead. We connected, and I resonated with her so much as if we were all one, then if she's dead, I'm dead, right?

It's been 32 hours I couldn't sleep. I then went through her old messages on this forum; I was trying to hold on to the last piece of her. It just hit me that I didn't even know her last name, her birthday, or her favorite food.

I asked where she was now, and the cards were showing me she's with her dog (passed away a few years back), now marching to the light. I asked if she would like to be my spiritual guide from now until I cross; she showed me a dog card, that she will always be my best companion.

She always pined for a loving family of her own, but that never happened for her. I wanted the same thing but we were having the worst luck and encountered the darkest vampires and demons of this planet earth. That's why we resonated so much. She showed me that in my future, she sees these things happening for me and that she will guide me to get there. I guess I will have to stay and try a little longer now, not just for me, but for us.

I hope that one day if I do get to have a beautiful wedding of my own, she will be there too, to witness that I have achieved the dream for both of us.

I know wholeheartedly that no more sufferings for her and she's in a better place now.",,,,,,,,

As far as I understood, she's an overachiever(she went to MIT not everyone can do that) and she had a lonely life. Worst luck in love life. She pined for a family a husband and a kid I suppose but none happened for her. Guys we're assholes they catfished her for money. And she met one guy last year, a total asshole, after dating her ghosted her and she found out he was already married. Even then she didn't care all she wanted was to be able to talk to him often and somehow his voice calms her down. And he wasn't able to give that to her and he was the last straw that broke the camels back. I know she fought hard. She traveled alone last year. That didn't help.
I know the amount of pain she is suffering mentally. This world isn't kind to her. At least I know she is no longer suffering now. I don't know if one day I will follow her lead I'm fighting hard too. But I know it would destroy my family…
Honestly I didn't think I'd feel this heavy. But as it happened the feelings are getting heavier. I'm trying to numb myself by watching SNL. It's hard for those who left behind. But I'm just glad she's no longer suffering.",2450019,2450020,,,,,,

We've done a bit of research on this strategy as well. Our method involves laying face down with the knife positioned where our heart is thumping. Deep breath in, deep breath out, then putting our weight down on the knife. You don't want to use a kitchen knife because they bend too much, thinnest sharpest knives work best. One example would be a fish fillet knife.

If you miss, you'll be in a ton of pain. No method is altogether pleasant, but anything to do with cutting/piercing will be pretty painful.

We are pretty comfortable with the idea of dying, we have no fear. We've also made multiple attempts over the years, the more we've failed the less we fear. However, the practice that first dissolved our fear of death completely was psychedelics. Our experiences with DMT line up perfectly with reports of near-death experiences.

I found comfort in being able to have a serious conversation about suicide with her at the start of our relationship. Before we started seeing each other more seriously I had expressed many times that I would commit suicide before the age of 30. She was also at a very dark time in her life and said that she felt the same way, and it was one of the ways we bonded very deeply. Since we did become so close due to similar world views, her stance changed and so did mine that even with her I foresaw my future lasting farther than that because we had each other in our lives (though to be fair she had an actual plan for life and a successful one). However, life is cruel as always. I finished my degree and whatever job and plans I had all revolved around this person, upon not receiving admission into my master's program (multiple different ones) my world shattered and we grew more and more distant because of this. Now she has left me because of my own insecurities and emotional immaturity and I own up to it. Before leaving me she pleaded many times to not kill myself but she knows I will. I refrained from expressing that I will CTB for her own sake and hope that she does not try to check in on me.

I've been stripped of my humanity, reduced to something less than human. No one sees me as a person with feelings, dreams, or compassion. Instead, everyone treats me like a hideous monster that can and should be mercilessly tormented. In the eyes of society, this is even a good thing. When someone makes me suffer, I bet they feel like they've just done justice or made the world better. That's right, because I committed the crime of being born very ugly. I know I shouldn't have ever existed.

In this world, I am the evil, all because I happen to look hideous. Once, I used to dream of being normal looking, of enjoying life and having everything that normal people do. But now, I have no such desire. I don't want to be alive in this world. I've been bullied and abused so much, and trust me, it never gets better. I can't ignore it. It's like having a wound that keeps getting torn open, over and over. It only ever gets worse.

The few times I've reached out for help, I've been met with indifference or even more cruelty. The loneliness is suffocating. Dreams of a better life, of companionship and happiness, have long since died. My spirit is broken, there is no hope left. This relentless torment has stripped me of my will to live. I've been living in hell for the past 20 years, and now, it's time to find my release, to break free from this endless cycle of suffering.

I am the blight upon this earth, the grotesque shadow that stains every corner of my existence. People recoil in horror at my presence, and I can't blame them. I am a walking reminder of everything that is wrong, a monstrosity that should never been created. My existence is a curse, not just for me, but for everyone who lays eyes on me. They see me as the embodiment of all that is hideous and wrong, and perhaps they're right. The world doesn't need such a hideous abomination like me, someone who brings nothing but discomfort and disgust. Maybe, just maybe, my absence will make the world a slightly less terrible place.",,,,,,,,

The cruelty of prohibiting encouragement of suicide,2596964,Unspoken7612,"Jul 15, 2024 at 6:49 AM","I should start by saying: it is good that we have laws preventing genuinely predatory individuals from exploiting the vulnerable, either because they stand to gain financially or simply because they gain sick pleasure from it. Inciting a non-suicidal person to commit suicide should be a criminal offence.

That said, these laws often go to far and serve to isolate suicidal people from their friends, loved ones, and support networks, leaving us feeling isolated and unsupported. I would like to be able to have conversations with people in which I express my suicidality and receive a genuinely empathetic, compassionate response, not just discouragement.

It is frustrating that any encounter with a medical professional includes them framing my desires as pathological, when, as I see it, the pathology is my state of living. I wish to be dead and want help obtaining that state, but legally nobody can provide that.",,,,,,,,

,2596949,Rubypie41,"Jul 15, 2024 at 6:36 AM","It's such a messed up scenario. No normal people bring others into this world intentionally to for them to suffer, but If people put their hand on their heart and said the true reason they had children, I believe the majority would be purely be for selfish reasons (they wanted children for their own pleasure, own purpose, own reasons, to give them meaning, responsibility, reasons to live, protection, someone for them to love etc.). How many people could hand on heart say their sole reason for having children was purely for the benefit of the child, I would argue very few, if any. Like did they really sit down one day and say this world is so magical that we simply have to bring someone new into it so they can experience just how magical this place is, I don't think so. For some the world is magical, but for others it's a dark place full of struggles, adversities, grief, pain, hard work, battles, conflict, illnesses and ultimately death awaits us all. We are all trying to soften the blow on ourselves by getting better jobs, earning more money for freedom and security, making friends to feel connected and less lonely/isolated, having a family to fit in with society and to have children that gives us pleasure, purpose, security etc. People by nature are inherintly selfish and in a lot of respect having children is an inherintly selfish thing to do.

I don't personally have any children, we did try but after a miscarriage and failed IVF it just didn't happen. That's not sad for the unborn child because they know nothing of it, it was incredibly sad for me and my partner because we wanted a child in our lives, we wanted to experience the magic of seeing what the child looked like, raising and nurturing the child, but still, all of those reasons are because that's what we wanted and I emphasis the word we, it's not necessarily what the child would have wanted because they are not created yet.

If the child had of been born and went on to suffer some chronic illness that caused them either physical or mental anguish that could not be cured, then how many parents out there would accept if the child said they wanted out of this world for their suffering to end. I believe very few would accept this, again for selfish reasons. If the child is gone then the parents feel like a failure, they are left without that main purpose in their lives, they are left with grief of their loss, left without protection, left without meaning etc.

My point here is having children whether you like it or not is a selfish act, as is not letting your child go if they are suffering and wanting to end it. Very sad, but also very true.

The moment you become a parent, you made that decision, so if you're the one suffering then I believe you have a duty to do everything possible to keep going, but I also understand there are limits and when pushed beyond what the mind is capable of taking, even parents will and do take their own lives.

If you're the child with no children of your own, then you do not owe it to your parents to keep suffering. They brought you here without your input, so should accept you wanting to leave out of love, compassion and not wanting you just to be around and suffer for their own selfish reasons.",2596891,,,,,,,

I keep hearing how either those meds don't work, make the person feel empty, or make them addicted; even worse is that often they are forced on them. It is so infuriating how people talk about respecting bodily autonomy but then go back on their word whenever they feel like it. I feel SO bad for the people who had psych meds forced on them. It's so dystopian.

The way the world views depression and how forced commitment is considered okay is my #1 reason for being suicidal. Forced commitment is absolutely disgusting.

The modern world has made life so miserable and stressful, and depression is a valid reaction to it. Psychiatry exists for profit and thrives off of convincing its victims that there is something wrong with them for feeling bad or stressed; it is a billion-dollar industry that exists to profit from suffering and to keep people suffering for profit when they are convinced they have to keep buying meds instead of eliminating the roots of their problems. In fact, it tries to persuade its victims that there are no roots to their problems; that is the lie of the chemical imbalance theory. With that lie, they can force antidepressants more easily.

The world knows that if they were to make suicide legal and truly available or into a valid personal choice it truly is, they would lose half of their slave work forces and would stop generating billions from these practices, with the danger of capitalism falling apart since it depends on modern slavery for survival.


Here are some quotes that back me up:

""Hunter-gatherers seem to possess exceptional mental health (Thomas, 2006). This observation has led some researchers to believe that depression is a ""disease of modernity"" (Hidaka, 2012) due to its increased prevalence among wealthier modern populations. (Depression for Surviving Ancestral Hardships - OSF.)

The global antipsychotic drugs market size was valued at USD 16.14 billion in 2023. The market is projected to grow from USD 17.32 billion in 2024 to USD 26.48 billion by 2032, exhibiting a CAGR of 5.4% during the forecast period. (Fortune Business Insights.)

Heavens forbid they'd ever see me as a person of my own or offer me any affection, so off to the psychiatrist! I was on Prozac at 14 and tried pretty much every garbage at the time.They did nothing to me, of course, as I have a good brain that remained fully aware of my unchanged circumstances.

Now I've been in pain for years while incompetents and not-give-a-damns knew very well how to suck my money while ignoring the severity of my problem. It started with a torn tendon and now my whole body is twisted and torn because of them. So what's the reasonable thing to do, the thing they're all very worried about?

the bit about chemical imbalances not existing is technically true. but misleading. there's definitely evidence that serotonin, dopamine, etc. have some relationship with depression, but we don't know if that's a deficiency, or a higher tolerance/decreased efficiency of those neurotransmitters.

It truly is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a sick society.

Psychiatry exists for profit and thrives off of convincing its victims that there is something wrong with them for feeling bad or stressed; it is a billion-dollar industry that exists to profit from suffering and to keep people suffering for profit when they are convinced they have to keep buying meds instead of eliminating the roots of their problems. In fact, it tries to persuade its victims that there are no roots to their problems; that is the lie of the chemical imbalance theory. While it is true that the chemical imbalance theory is complex, it was without a doubt pushed to market antidepressants.

I would also like to add that after they commit you, they make sure to squeeze as much money out of you once they get you into the mental hospitals. I've heard the treatment is always very poor.

It is true that after involuntary commitment discharges from psychiatric facilities, suicides statistically increase, which is due to violating people and their rights. No one deserves such sub-human ""treatment.""

And, knowing that, for what type of posture?

I don't think I have yet seen a case mentioned here where someone very clearly says that this is what happened. I think I have seen one where a person said they stood up, but I couldn't be completely sure that the person fully blacked out.

Edit: I have found a person in this thread who reports standing up after blacking out. https://sanctioned-suicide.net/threads/partial-hanging-closet-bar.169188/#post-2570614

I guess we are not going to hear from anyone for whom this didn't happen.",2596821,,,,,,,
,2596856,Praestat_Mori,"Jul 15, 2024 at 4:39 AM","I think you'll have to wait for people who actually failed their partial attempts and what they think why it failed. I don't recall a successful GBT with partial atm.

Imo failing a partial is possible bc if the pressure on the neck can't be kept up to block blood flow chances of survival (incl survival with brain damage) are high. I would always consider full to partial bc once the chair is kicked away there's no way back, regardless how long it takes.",2596850,,,,,,,
,2596861,motoko_s9,"Jul 15, 2024 at 4:43 AM","I have a scientific paper with literature review that says that of the cases where it was mentioned, over half had feet in contact with the ground.

Of course that is where it is mentioned. Maybe it is considered more noteworthy when the feet are in contact with the ground.
Edit: in Ohio the vast majority (83%) were partial suspension.

Also from data in England:

""Information on degree of suspension was available for 149 cases. Seventy-eight of these (52.4%) were found totally suspended (both feet above the ground). In about one-quarter (35 out of 149, 23.5%) the subjects were suspended with their feet touching the ground, in 11 cases (7.4%) they were kneeling, in 13 lying (8.7%) and in 7 seated (4.7%). The precise position was unclear in a further 5 cases involving partial suspension (3.4%).""

This is 149 cases out of a total of 162.

,2556785,TheLamest,"Jun 11, 2024 at 10:02 AM","How to kill yourself in fourteen days.

A poem by: TheLamest

On the first day you will get up from bed and brush your teeth with too much toothpaste and get dressed in clothes you never enjoyed wearing. You will walk to school and stare at the cracks in the sidewalk and the grass jutting out at the sides. The ants will be running along where concrete meets pavement, because that will be the thing to do.

There is so much there that you have never noticed the first time around.

On the second day you will get home from school and sit in bed for several minutes until they reach seventeen and the forty-first second. You will claw at your desk for a pencil, idly trace lines into the journal you keep under you pillow, and try not to think about the burning in your eyes. Briefly, you will consider scanning the room for your phone and wonder if they'd miss you. You will instead clutch the pencil tighter and do your homework, because that will be the thing to do.

You feel as though your presence is a burden and that this is all you will ever be.

On the third day you will think about killing yourself tomorrow. Maybe the day after tomorrow. Maybe even the day after that. You don't think you can make it to the fourth, much less the fourteenth. You will rake your hands through your hair and against your better judgment you will pick up the blade instead of the pen. Instead of word after word it will leave cut after cut, the temporary relief and euphoria will only be chased by that sickness in your gut getting heavier. You will clean yourself up and act as if nothing happened, because that will be the thing to do.

It will not change anything, it has never changed anything.

On the fourth day you will break your first promise to your mother and smoke a cigarette. The kids behind the school offered you one, and with their eyes on you, staring, watching, waiting, you could only choke on your tongue in response. It reminded you of the way your parents smoked, the way the ashtray by the window smelled and how the smoke gave you and asthma attack when you were seven. In the end, you will take one and smoke with them, because that will be the thing to do.

Unlike you, they're too cowardly to jump, so they kill themselves a little every day.

On the fifth day you will stay home, because it is the weekend. The comfort of your bed sticks tighter to your skin and your eyes feel like they have been sewn shut. A notification will ring off your phone, or maybe it's an alarm. All the same, at this point, because everything means the same thing. Get up. You will turn it over from where it lies face-down on your pillow, barely even look up, and set it back down. Eventually, you will get up, because that will be the thing to do.

Comfort is running thin, and you're beginning to find that it doesn't feel like it used to.

On the sixth day your patience will run thin. Your temper will get worse and you'll think, maybe it is the damn phones. When your mother comes up to your room and tells you in that comforting soft voice, ""your father and I are getting a divorce"", there is nothing left to feel at all. Your eyes will go blank and your thoughts will quiet down for a moment, the prime example of love early on in your life falling apart with eight simple words. You will want to scream and throw the lamp sitting next to you on the bedside cabinet, but instead you will hug her and tell her you love her, because that will be the thing to do.

Please be gentle, it is her first time living too.

On the seventh day you will fall asleep in class. The light fixture overhead could fall at the right angle and kill you. You've thought about that, hoped for it even, but rested your head on your arms and shut your eyes anyway. The teacher's call will jerk you awake and the class's giggles will ring in your ears for the rest of the day. She will ask you a question that you don't know how to answer, for everything in your mind is rattled and mismatched and missing, and you will sit silently until she gets frustrated and give you detention. Every piece of your mind, as frazzled as it is, will tell you to say something back, ask for help, beg her to be kinder, but you will say nothing, because that will be the thing to do.

She will skip by your desk every day after you're dead, and every time her heart will tug with wonder at how she never noticed.

On the eighth day you will cry. It will be loud and ugly and your body will wither and shake with sobs. You will crumble into a fetal position and turn your head away from your mother as she bursts into your room. You haven't cried like this before, and haven't cried at all in a very long time. Her confusion will dissolve into pity and she will hold you tight and try to comfort you as she did before, only you are not a child anymore. Every muscle in your body will tense and you will try to rid yourself of her and she will hold on anyway, because that will be the thing to do.

Despite everything, you are still her child, the object of her love, and always will be.

On the ninth day you will scroll endlessly through social media hoping for something. anything, to give you a glimpse of serotonin. You'll find a video of a cat and consider sending it to your sister, but the two of you don't talk anymore. The two of you haven't talked in a while. You'll get off the app and open up a writing document instead. You will type and type and type, but the words are incoherent and dizzy on the screen. You will keep writing anyway, trying to chase out any feelings of negativity, but will instead hollow yourself to not feel a thing. You will get up and go on with your day, because that will be the thing to do.

You can never write like you used to, the only thing you are good for now is to suffer.

On the tenth day your school will hold an assembly about mental health. Your friends will all sit together with one spot too little and you will move to the front row instead. It doesn't bother you now. It's happened too many times to. They will bring in a speaker and he will move as he talks and make grand gestures with both hands. He will wear a black t-shirt and jeans and half the school won't be paying any attention to him. You'll listen, because there's not much else to do except listen to the kid next to you breathing through their mouth and sniffling every twelve seconds. Eventually they will let you go and you will stand up and walk to the door and hesitate. There will be a table full of flyers for those who can anonymously reach out and talk. Briefly, your hand will hover over it, but you will quickly retract it and walk away, because that will be the thing to do.

It is not cowardly to need help or to ask for it, and being ill does not mean you are lesser.

On the eleventh day you will type ""how to kill yourself"" into your browser. Instead of anything helpful, you will find the suicide and crisis lifeline. After what feels like hours of hesitation, you will slowly click on their website and sign up for a chat with someone. You will tell this person that you are thinking of death and they will respond in a friendly-enough, blatantly trained way that seems to invalidate all the thoughts of your struggle. You will get more and more worked up and they will ask a question that has you shaking. You will shut off your phone and forget the conversation, because that will be the thing to do.

The person's name was Nox by the way, and they'll be left wondering if you're alive for the rest of their life.

On the twelfth day someone close to you will leave unexpectedly. It will be for reasons you cannot understand and you will beg them to stay. They will leave anyway, and then you promise to yourself that you will never stoop as low as you did in that moment just to please others. Sooner or later though, you will break that vow, because you are incapable of hurting anyone but yourself. You will take the razor for the second time in these two weeks, and start cutting, bleeding everywhere, because that will be the thing to do.

You always have hurt yourself in the end, and your self-hate is your most incurable disease.

On the thirteenth day you will go to a carnival and eat popcorn and watch the clowns jibber and poke at one another. You were supposed to go with your friends, but they ran off and you don't know where they went. You will win a game and get a big teddy bear but give it to the kid that's been eyeing it all day. You will never forget the smile on their face and a hurried, backwater ""thank you"" as they run off to their parents. You will try to not let it make you sick to your stomach, only moving forward and continuing your day, because that will be the thing to do.

That kid will never know you killed yourself, and you will never be able to experience a moment like that again.

On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you will wake up early and make your bed for the first time in months. You will shower in cold water, brush your teeth twice, and get dressed in clothes you've always liked. You will say goodbye to your pet and walk to school. On the way, you will see ants walking along the sidewalk cracks and a pencil on the street. You will see a razor blade in the grass of someone's lawn and a cigarette butt on the concrete of the driveway. You will get tired and almost fall asleep where you stand, snapped awake by the thought of your parents. What was a what will never be, not anymore. Your thoughts won't make sense and you will want to cry, but instead you will take your phone from your pocket and scroll as you walk. You'll send that cat video to your sister and think of the man from the assembly. You will think about how he probably would've gotten along with Nox. You will think of how everyone leaves and how sometimes being a child and having a giant teddy bear is the greatest feeling in the world.

On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you will go to school and sit through math and talk to one or two people in english. They seem to enjoy your company but you really can't be sure, so you get up and leave the instant the bell rings and ignore any other conversation they try to share with you.

On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you will walk home, slower this time, and sit on your bed for an hour. Not lying down, not sleeping, just sitting, sitting and wondering. You will eventually reach for a sheet of paper and a pen, and will write. You will write about struggle, about momentary triumph, about all that there has ever been instead of all that there will be. You will be fixed and set the paper down and try not to cry but the tears are already boiling over. You will set the pen down.

On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you will leave your house, the note on your bed, and bring nothing with you but the clothes on your back and the weight in your chest. You will walk and walk and walk until you find something of suitable height.

On the fourteenth day before you kill yourself you will stand on firm concrete, staring down at something beyond and below. The thought's aren't so dizzy anymore, only a chorus of *jump* and *run*. You won't be sure which one is louder. The view from above is both a bone-chilling nightmare and a simple haze of dreams. Your foot will reach the edge, your whole body shaking with nerves and incoherence, and you will exhale one. Twice.

The second you're about to kill yourself you will jump before you can figure out why you shouldn't. You will go as quickly and quietly as you thought you would, and they won't find your body until the next morning. You will forget yourself as you fall, and you will die before you can second-guess it. You will leave this world thinking of your mother, because that will be the thing to do.

There are no words of comfort where you are going, only the wind whipping across your face.",,,,,,,,

2022: Barely passed The high school exam which led me to go to a poor college with a major I don't want to do but i am forced to do it because its the only one accepted me . And it's hard AF (Physics)
2023: Failed my first year of college
2024:The big exam is next week and I've barely studied anything and didn't attend any lectures . Since I failed 2 years I am getting kicked out
What hurts me the most is my family which have high expectations on me . They give me facility and spend a lot of money on extra classes for me even tho we were poor at that time . Constantly disappointed them but I think they lost hope on me. But still sometimes I notice that they still which to see me succeed.and that just breaks me
I've decided to end it because of constant depression anxiety and failure.
I really want to live I really have a lot of dreams. Things to accomplish. Bucket list to finish . Books to read . Movies and Shows to Watch . I may even meet someone that loves me in the future. I am forced to do it because I don't want to see their reaction when I fail again . I am currently practicing partial hanging and ill do it when they leave for vacation next week .

I feel that specific events from past and current life overlap, that a situation is mirroring what happened in my past life more or less. Events, people, enemies and friends reveal themselves and disappear in a calculated order. A lot of deja vu. I'm just a spectator of a movie which I call 'my life'.

It explains why I did some things in a specific, intuitive way and they turned out this specific way. I just repeat them automatically like I did before. These are deep ingrained patterns of behavior, habits and we, our minds prefer to stick with what is known becouse it is effortless.

The wheel turns and we can either improve some aspects of our lives or worsen them.

I could assume that it is just delusion of my mind or imagination but I investigated. Astrology precisely describes what is going on.

I CTB in my past life and this situation repeats itself until it gets resolved. It has sweet, ephemeral dreamlike quality. That's how I would describe the feeling.",,,,,,,,

Now from the little bit of digging that I did here it looks like a lot of people are against it because it can cause trauma for the conductor and the passengers. I think that I can solve that.

My plan is to lay on the tracks where my neck is on the rail to cause decapitation, I also plan on taking benzos and sleeping pills to be more drauzy and hopefully my SI won't kick in. I plan on doing it in the middle of the night at a specific place where the train is going fast and there is a lot of vegetation so hopefully the conductor won't see me.

,2596407,KillingPain267,"Jul 14, 2024 at 5:43 PM","Don't underestimate opioids. I was extremely suicidal before I tried using them, but then tried them and felt like I didn't care about anything. My whole family could have died, and I lost my legs, but I wouldn't have given a shit if that happened if I was high as a kite on opioids. Opioid abuse postponed my ctb plans for the month I was on them. But tolerance grew and it became more and more expensive to buy them to be high every waking hour, so I had to detox. While sober I was fully suicidal again and researching methods. Pregabalin and benzos don't do the same to me, but they numb me to sleepiness while not fully falling asleep, so they might be more suited for numbing pure SI. Anyway, everyone reacts differently so I advise you to test the drugs and dose and imagine how it would feel decapitated by a train while on benzos or pregabalin and prepare well before doing an actual attempt. It will end horrifically if you're not successful with this method. But be careful with benzos and pregabalin, they are addictive too. I wish you the best",2596146,,,,,,,

I haven't felt at peace and happy in a long time. I've had happiness but there was so much fear that I was never at peace. But when I think of CTB, I become so.. happy. Just, it's so relieving. It's the only thought that gets me up and doing things. Going to continue researching for sources tomorrow (pretty set on SN, but if it's not an option I guess I'll think of others...). Actually, if anyone has any suggestions for methods that
-can be done from my own room
-doesn't require a vehicle or things like charcoal (hard to access atm)
-gives me a little time before doing and dying (I'd like to slowly go unconscious. Fast (10-20min) is ok, like SN, but preferably not as fast as jumping)
-isn't extremely painful

I think I've done enough research on this site to know my options, but just in case.

Anyways, the point of this post mostly is this: happy. I smile when I think of CTB. I feel so light, it's like all the years of stress evaporates off of me. I've said for awhile I think I'd feel better if I could just have some rest. I never could. Circumstances didn't really allow. But now, I can. Just one more hurdle of researching and planning out the procedures. And then it can allllllll stop. I didn't even realize *how* much weight was hanging on me until I decided to CTB. When it lifted off, I realized how amazing it feels to be....... at peace. I am at peace now because I'm going to rest. And now no one can stop me.

,2552874,rem2024,"Jun 8, 2024 at 3:37 AM","A couple of days ago, I failed at charcoal burning once again because I had police and fire called on me because my Chimney starter produced to much smoke. I was going to use my outdoor balcony closet to commit suicide as my garage I learned is way to big. I had to throw my chimney starter across the fence on to street when I noticed police and fire came. It still had coals in it burning, and had just started to produce carbon monoxide. Now that has failed, I am going to do this with proper planning.

I've been researching the tent method, and since i have access to a car, I am going to drive to a camp site, pay to go into a camp site where barbque and grilling is normal and buy a tent. properly follow all the instructions this time, make sure no one else gets hurt and so on. I am a little lost on what do do with the chimney starter. Should I buy another cheap portable grill around 45 dollars or so? Then once the smoke dispels, then pour the read coals into the girl, bring the girl into the tent close the lid, and let the fumes come out?

I am also not sure what to do about the people who care about me either. What I am doing is truly selfish as I have least 10 to 15 if not more who are praying for me.

I attend a well know Presbyterian church, the staff knows of my issue, paid for my rent for more than 6 months while I was in school, and then I failed school after trying so hard. Never once had they asked for the money back, but I have Autism, and I can not provide for my self on any level. I can't even pay June rent and I just got done driving for 10 hours doing Uber/Lyft and that's about the only (not a real Job, independent contractor), that I can hold down. I have applied to countless jobs and no call backs. I have a friend right now who is willing to help me with what I have to pay for rent this month. I asked him to give me to Saturday because he wanted to help me with the rest of my rent. I have worked my butt off trying to make it were he only has to help out with 300/400 dollars. I even had another friend buy me a video game just so I can take my mind off the stress.

All I am trying to say is, I have a counselor who I been seeing for 10 years who loves me very much, several friends who have helped me. I have a non biological mom (not adopted) who is a special needs school teacher who has helped me with my autism for more than 10 years. Several friends who are pastoral staff and counselors who care for me, and even called me this morning to check on me, but want me to live.

Yet net week we are considering getting back on SSI and disability because I can't hold a job and because of my autism can't have room mates, or get married (I'm 41). I feel lost, because although I have some amazing friends (no family, they don't care about me), living on SSI and disability for rest of my life is no life at all.

I have been bullied my entire life, was sexually abused when I was 8 years old as a boy. First Suicide attempt was at 10 years old by cutting my wrist. When I was 10 to 11 years old, I slept around with other adults while my parents beat me at home because they didn't know I had autism till I was 24. this was in the 80's as you can imagine.

By the time I turned 17 i went into sex trafficking as a fem boy for 5 years and got out in 2005 by trying to jump off a bridge and I got talked down. Later on in life I found out I am intersex, I am both male and female with xy chromosomes, otherwise known as complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (mulers syndrome). This is not transgender. So I walked away from my gender in 2017 full female now with a vagina might I add you and whole new set of friends as a woman, all my old friends left. I can't have kids, never get married, while I have friends, can't hold down a job, get bullied and picked on all the time. I am a Christian and reformed Christian to boot.

The Friends I do have are some very close lady friends who care for me, but yet I feel like they are wasting there time spending there money on me and at this point I am just tired, and I want out. I made a mistake and accidentally sent a pre scheduled suicide note out through gmail because I forgot after my attempt and went out to about 6 people at church. I am surprised they have not locked me up yet.

Since they haven't, I plan on doing what I said before and going camp site this time, but how do you get past these people caring for you? They want me to live, even willing to pay for my rent on some occasions. Staying on disability insurance for rest of my life is no way to live. And I am tired of trying to figure out how to fit into this world just to pay bills. Yet I am also afraid that when I die I will go to hell. Yet i know Christ forgives past present and future sins and if he knows my heart, the he knows I am just tired, I am tired and can't do this anymore. No matter how much medicine I take, scripture I read, counseling sessions I have, and job mentoring. I just can't do this anymore.

I'm not sure how I am supposed to feel. Why as someone who is Autistic do I have to care so much about these other people. I don't' know how to push back against my own feelings and fully ctb and do this right. No crying for help, no attention, no nothing, straight up ctb, no holds bar.",,,,,,,,

I think you caring so much about the people in your life shows how much love you truly have for them. I know you said you were being selfish in these actions or feelings of wanting to ctb but these things aren't always black and white.

I'm not a religious person by any means but I do believe god forgives and loves us all, he knows what's in our heart and understands each one of us. He sees your struggles and so much you've overcome in your life and him, all your loving friends and me are very proud of you.

Sorry if this wasn't the response you wanted but after reading your story you seem like a beautiful person inside and out with so much more to give.

I've had numerous attempts in the past couple of years and everyone turned their backs on me and left me to die but I have one friend, who after I lost everything and my will to live showed me it wasn't my time. Go to your friends, give them the biggest hugs and tell them how much they mean to you. If you still decide this is what you want at least let them know how blessed you were to have them in your life.

Unfortunately unknowns lead to religion. If you don't have the answer then people get ""scared"". Just the whole analogy of who your parents are will change your ""religion"". Not to mention there are 1000s of them - odds of picking 1/1000+ are not great lol.",2556297,,,,,,,

I watched my overly catholic grandparent die so painfully from cancer, it made me question how could she be punished after devoting so much to the lord and church.

It's only recently that I think being alive is actually hell. We're in hell now otherwise why would a god hurt so many people? Cancers and diseases, earthquakes, floods and fires?

I don't believe in Jesus and god, I do believe in a god just who knows which one, otherwise what is the point to life? I know there are spirits/ghosts. 50/50 on reincarnation but that's the scary bit, ending this life just to come back to repeat until you learn from your mistakes.

I know it's okay. That my family will understand that I was suffering immensely. I lived, loved, experienced travel and the world. I've seen and done enough to be satisfied with my life. Checked all of the boxes if you will. I tried my best to live a moral life and hopefully I contributed more good than evil to this world. But the batteries are drained and the lows are too low to want to put up with this.

Thanks to everyone on here for being there but I'm going to go dark for a while and contemplate my final decisions. I don't know if and when I will CTB but just know that if I do, I will be at peace.

I had a calm and rational discussion with someone near and dear to my heart.

They said it's okay if I want to go and they won't hold it against me or be sad because they know I will be at peace.

I am applying for MAID. I have type 2 diabetes and if I stop taking my diabetes medication, my kidneys will likely shit the bed. I know it's painful but I don't mind pain and have a very high pain tolerance. Then I can go out with dignity.

I am feeling so at peace right now having suffered from schizoaffective disorder and ADHD since the age of 15.

To give you a rundown of my life.

I stay home 24/7 if I can, afraid to leave the house. I feel people are watching me and talking about me when I leave my home, even when heavily medicated. When I return home, I believe people have been in my house and are playing mind games by moving things around, stealing things, etcetera.

So, my peace of mind is totally shot.

These delusions persist.

Previously to this, I believed I was the Anti-Christ and it was my mission to destroy the world or bring about armageddon. I also thought I could hurt people with my mind.

The guilt and shame from these delusions have persisted to this day.

Once again, my peace of mind is totally shot.

I have had good days sprinkled in and I will cherish those days always. I will always remember bird watching in the quietness of nature, appreciating the splendorous beauty of the majestic forests and open-air aviaries I've had the pleasure of visiting.

If I were to go to heaven, it would be a giant rain forest with every colourful, majestic bird and animal you can imagine. I would sit there, watching them and feed them from my hand. This is my heaven and this is the place I'm hoping to go once I cross over.

I know you can appreciate where I am coming from. And, for those whom are still holding on. Hold on with all you can if you can, try to see the world, or move to another town or city. The possibilities are endless for you if you have faith.

I have lost faith in life and hope for my future but it might be okay for you and if this message can offer you hope, please hold on.

I will lurk here until the time comes and keep you posted.

Thanks for all the love and support.

And please, don't think of me as a hypocrite for saying I would go dark for a while and coming back so soon.

This place is my only way of interacting with people whom understand where I am coming from. It's like a second home, a waiting room where everyone is so friendly and welcoming and relatable. A rare place indeed!",,,,,,,,

Esse documento foi criado para dar uma compreensão completa do método do nitrito de sódio (que será chamado daqui pra baixo de SN).
O que ele é, como funciona e como usá-lo.

Esse guia respeitará as regras do fórum, então nenhum link pra fontes, vendedores, lojas, fabricantes etc será incluso. É proibido postar links pra tais no fórum público.
Caso você precise de fontes (vendedores, lojas etc), use um buscador da internet (recomendo o DuckDuckGo), usando os critérios mencionados nesse guia para ajudá-lo a encontrar.

O QUE É SN?

SN é um sal inorgânico usado amplamente em processamento de comida (principalmente em carnes processadas) e para diversos outros fins. Pode vir em um grande alcance de cores, desde um branco brilhante até um pó amarelado ou cristais.

POR QUE SN?

O livro The Peaceful Pill eHandbook (abreviado PPH) considera o SN como uma forma pacífica de encerrar sua vida. Os autores afirmaram isso após observar a morte de inúmeras pessoas que ingeriram SN.

ONDE CONSIGO COMPRAR O SN?

O SN pode ser encontrado nos maiores mercados online famosos. Procure por ""nitrito de sódio"" ou equivalente na sua linguagem. Use buscadores de internet e você o encontrará em ""lojas de reagentes"" ou ""lojas de química"", que venderão pra você.

Se assegure de que você está comprando nitrito, e não nitrato.

Se assegure também de que o teor de pureza seja pelo maior do que 95%. Quanto mais próximo de 100%, melhor.

Não confunda SN com ""sais de cura"" ou com outros condimentos que são à base de cloreto de sódio. Não compre nitrato.

Qual é melhor: SN de grau alimentício ou de grau analítico/laboratorial?

Os dois funcionam e são aceitáveis, desde que o teor de pureza seja maior do que 95% (essa informação é encontrada na descrição do produto e no rótulo do mesmo).

COMO O SN FUNCIONA?

Quando ingerido, nitrito de sódio reduz os níveis sanguíneos de oxigênio, levando a hipóxia terminal e a morte. O SN faz isso entrando na corrente sanguínea e alterando a hemoglobina encontrada nos glóbulos vermelhos, causando metahemoglobinemia. A metahemoglobina é uma forma alterada de hemoglobina que possui uma habilidade reduzida de transportar oxigênio. Quando o sangue possui altos níveis de metahemoglobina, a quantidade de oxigênio que é levado ao cérebro e aos outros órgãos essenciais é reduzida, o que leva a morte.

COMO EU ME SENTIRIA DURANTE UM ENVENENAMENTO POR SN?

Os seguintes sintomas podem ser observados durante um envenamento por SN:
Náusea
Fadiga e fraqueza
Letargia
Hipotensão (pressão baixa)
Cefaléia (dor de cabeça)
Cianose (os lábios e as unhas mudam de cor, se tornando azuis)
Confusão
Tontura
Taquicardia (coração acelerado)

Você não necessariamente irá ter todos esses sintomas. Eles promovem um baixo nível de desconforto e você sofrerá pouco durante o processo.

O QUE EU PRECISO E POR QUÊ?

O único componente essencial é o SN (e a água para dissolver o SN).

Sim, você consegue CTB tendo acesso só ao SN, sem as medicações auxiliares. É preciso que isso fique claro, pois essa é uma dúvida comum. Algumas pessoas conseguem o SN mas não as medicações, e CTB é possível da mesma forma. A única coisa

As medicações sugeridas nesse guia servem apenas, ou para prevenir o vômito (chamadas de anti-eméticos), ou para potenciar a toxicidade do SN (no caso, o anti-ácido e o propranolol).

COMO UTILIZAR O MÉTODO SN

DOSE RECOMENDADA DE SN

25 gramas de SN, dissolvido em 50-70ml de água potável pura, para pessoas com menos de 100kg.

35 gramas de SN, dissolvido em 70-100ml de água potável pura, para pessoas com mais de 100kg.

É importante que todo o SN seja dissolvido na água. Caso ainda haja cristais no fundo do copo, adicione pequenas quantidades de água e agite o copo. O objetivo é usar o mínimo de água possível.

É importante que somente água potável pura seja utilizada para fazer o drink. Não considere a opção de usar suco de frutas, refrigerante ou bebidas carbonatadas para tentar fazer o gosto do drink ser melhor. Isso tornaria o processo mais lento, e tomar SN em uma bebida ácida negaria o uso do anti-ácido.

Não use mais que 100ml de água por copo. Na verdade, de 50 a 70ml costuma ser o suficiente. O objetivo é fazer com que o SN chegue na sua corrente sanguínea o mais rápido possível, para que você não sinta qualquer sintoma por mais tempo do que você precisa sentir. É por isso que usar água pura é a forma recomendada, acima de qualquer outro método, e é por isso que a quantidade de água deve ser a menor possível.

Prepare pelo menos dois copos. É altamente recomendável ter copos reservas para beber caso haja vômito após tomar o primeiro copo.

MEDICAÇÕES ANTI-VÔMITO:

O segundo aspecto mais importante do método, depois de preparar o drink de SN e bebê-lo, é fazer com que ele fique no seu corpo (não vomitar). Você está tomando um líquido tóxico e as defesas do seu corpo podem reconhecer isso e tentar limpar seu corpo. Uma das defesas é o vômito. A função do anti-emético é prevenir vômito.

Se o SN não ficar no seu estômago, o método não funcionará. Há relatos de casos de pessoas que seguiram a dose correta do anti-emético mas mesmo assim vomitaram, então não há garantia. Eu sugiro que você faça tudo que for possível para não vomitar.

Nem todo anti-emético serve para esse método. Comprar um para enjôo de viagem (como Dramin), por exemplo, não funcionará, pois essas drogas agem na parte errada do cérebro para o método SN. O que você precisa é de um bloqueador de dopamina, que são o mesmo tipo de medicação que é usado para prevenir vômito em pessoas que recebem quimioterapia.

É altamente recomendado tomar uma dose teste do anti-emético que você pretende usar, em uma data separada do dia da tentativa, para saber se ele causará alguma reação negativa em você. Isso serve para evitar surpresas desagradáveis no dia da tentativa.

Os anti-eméticos de primeira-escolha recomendados pelo nosso guia serão a Metoclopramida (também conhecida como Plasil, que é um bloqueador de dopamina) e a ondansetrona (também chamada de Vonau, que é um bloqueador do receptor 5-HT3), por serem altamente eficientes e serem a primeira-escolha do PPH.

Nota: Algumas pessoas têm reações negativas com metoclopramida (Plasil). Para essas, recomendamos substituir a metoclopramida por domperidona, já que esta segunda possui menos chances de causar efeitos adversos.

COMO POTENCIAR O SN PARA QUE ELE FIQUE AINDA MAIS LETAL:

A potenciação se trata de tornar o SN mais eficiente como método de encerrar a própria vida, aumentando sua confiabilidade e sua rapidez.

POTENCIAÇÃO COM JEJUM:

Uma morte confiável depende do SN sobrecarregar a enzima restorativa metahemoglobina redutase. Para conseguir isso, uma rápida absorção do SN no intestino é necessária. Isso pode ser conseguido jejuando por algumas horas antes de tomar o SN.

O tempo do jejum é relativo, pois depende muito do que você comeu na última refeição e de quão pesada e grande foi sua última refeição. Alguns alimentos são digeridos com mais facilidade que outros. Evite refeições grandes ou pesadas antes de iniciar o jejum (evite principalmente fibra alimentar e alimentos gordurosos).

Recomendamos pelo menos 8 horas de jejum ""normal"" (jejum de comida, podendo beber água normalmente).

Sendo as últimas 2 horas, jejum ""seco"". Ou seja, sem beber nenhum líquido nessas últimas duas horas, a não ser a água usada para engolir os medicamentos, se for usar algum.

POTENCIAÇÃO COM PROPRANOLOL

Há várias maneiras de aumentar a eficiência do SN. Dentre elas, o uso de um beta-bloqueador (como o Propranolol) é considerada a maneira mais eficiente.

O Propranolol funciona interferindo na resposta cardíaca compensatória aos efeitos da baixa quantidade de oxigênio no sangue.

Conforme o cérebro recebe pouco oxigênio, uma ""mensagem"" é enviada ao coração para que ele aumente o fluxo sanguíneo. Entretanto, com o propranolol presente, essa mensagem é bloqueada. Não havendo um aumento compensatório do fluxo sanguíneo para o cérebro, a consciência é rapidamente perdida.

Nota: As apresentações de propranolol que são de liberação prolongada (XR, ER, etc) são inadequadas para esse fim. O que você quer é o propranolol ""comum"" (de ""liberação rápida"").

POTENCIAÇÃO COM ANTI-ÁCIDOS:

No seu estômago há algo chamado suco gástrico, e um dos componentes desse suco é o ácido clorídrico (HCl). Quando o SN, que possui a fórmula NaNO2, reage com o HCl (da seguinte forma: 3NaNO2 + 2HCl -> 2NaCl + NaNO3 + 2No + H2O), uma parte do SN é perdida. Não há HCl suficiente no seu estômago para converter toda a dose recomendada de SN, mas ele irá reduzí-la. Portanto menos SN irá passar para o intestino delgado, onde o processo de transferência para a corrente sanguínea ocorre. A função do anti-ácido é diminuir essa conversão, para que mais SN se mova até o intestino delgado e mais SN seja absorvido.

Medicações comuns que reduzem o ácido estomacal são boas o suficientes.

Alguns exemplos são:
Cimetidina (Tagamet)
Omeprazol
Esomeprazol
etc

ONDE EU CONSIGO ESSAS MEDICAÇÕES?

Farmácias comuns. Nenhuma destas medicações precisa de receita.

.

STATUS LEGAL:

Atualmente é totalmente legal comprar e estar em posse de SN, na maioria dos países, incluindo o Brasil.

.

PRECISO TESTAR A PUREZA DO SN?

Não é necessário testar uma amostra de SN que foi comprada em mercados legítimos (com teor de pureza >95%), pois não existem incentivos para falsificação, considerando que no caso do SN não existem restrições legais para compra ou posse do mesmo.

Restrições legais (proibição, criminalização) aumentam artificialmente a demanda e o preço de produtos, assim atraindo golpistas, da mesma forma como ocorre com substâncias como Cianeto, Nembutal, esteróides anabolizantes, maconha, cocaína e outras drogas recreacionais. Este não é o caso do SN, que é totalmente legal, tanto sua compra, venda, quanto sua posse.

.

O QUE ACONTECERÁ DEPOIS QUE EU BEBER O SN?

Alguns efeitos comuns são:

- Náusea

Esse provavelmente é o sintoma mais comum. A náusea pode ocorrer por diversos motivos.

A náusea é uma reação normal do corpo ao perceber uma toxina em circulação (como acontece quando nós ingerimos muito álcool).

Ansiedade também pode produzir náusea. Pessoas que fazem apresentações em público frequentemente sentem náusea antes de subir no palco.

Após vomitar, uma das duas coisas acontecerá: ou o vômito terá muco estomacal, que é uma substância transparente e grudenta, ou terá o líquido com SN. Um dos motivos pelos quais é recomendado usar pouca água é para que seja possível perceber se você vomitou tudo ou não. As pessoas preparam 3 copos de SN para poder beber mais caso elas sintam que vomitaram SN demais. Pessoas conseguiram ter sucesso mesmo após vomitar, então vômito não é fracasso automático.

- Fraqueza

A menor quantidade de oxigênio circulando faz com que as pessoas sintam cansaço e fraqueza. Você vai querer se deitar.

- Taquicardia

Se você não usou propranolol, você sentirá seu coração batendo mais rápido. Isso é a resposta que o corpo dá após perceber que há menos oxigênio no sangue. Ele tenta compensar a menor quantidade de oxigênio, movendo o sangue mais rapidamente pelo corpo.

- Cianose

As unhas e as pontas dos dedos podem se tornar azuladas ou roxas. Isso é sinal de que o SN já entrou em circulação e que você perderá a consciência em breve.

- Tontura

O SN causa uma queda na pressão arterial, que pode levar à tontura. Estar próximo à cama ou deitado em uma cadeira reclinável é recomendado, para evitar quedas que possam gerar barulho ou desconforto.

- Sonolência

Uma das respostas do cérebro à falta de oxigênio é diminuir sua atividade e se desligar. Isso causará sonolência. Esse é um bom indicador de que a perda de consciência está muito próxima. Essa é uma forma de observar que está realmente funcionando.

- Perda de consciência

Isso pode levar até 20 minutos para acontecer, a partir do momento em que você tomou o drink. O desmaio pode acontecer antes. Aqueles que já sofrem de pressão baixa irão sucumbir mais rapidamente. Apesar da potenciação do SN com propranolol não ser essencial, ela faz com que a consciência seja perdida mais rapidamente.

- Morte

Entre 40 minutos e 4 horas, dependendo da sua saúde e metabolismo natural. Não há forma de prever o tempo pessoal que levará para um indivíduo. SN potenciado com Propranolol produz uma morte mais rápida, como veremos abaixo.

Quando descoberto, sua pele estará com uma descoloração cinza-azul devido à cianose. Por conta da ampla linha do tempo na qual a morte será alcançada, é vital que você leve esse fator em conta no seu planejamento, para evitar que seja encontrado precocemente.

Não ser encontrado precocemente é um dos principais fatores que devem ser levados em consideração ao plenejar um suicídio usando SN. Você precisa ter certeza de que estará sozinho por um período de pelo menos 4 horas.

O SN possui um antídoto, chamado Azul de Metileno, que pode ser administrado por uma equipe de emergência caso eles suspeitem que houve uma ingestão de nitrito. Isso pode ser qualquer caso no qual a cianose (descoloração azul ou roxa da pele) não seja corrigida pela administração de oxigênio.

.

QUANTO TEMPO LEVA PARA O SN SURTIR EFEITO?

Uma linha do tempo típica de um envenenamento com SN potenciado se dá assim:

@ 3 minutos: Tontura, fraqueza.

@ 5 minutos: Sonolento, responsivo.

@ 12 minutos: Inconsciente.

@ 15 minutos: Sono profundo, não-despertável.

@ 25 minutos: Cianose aumentada (lábios e extremidades adquirem uma descoloração cinza-azul ou roxa).

@ 30 minutos: Respiração irregular e superficial.

@ 40 minutos: Morto.

.

INTERAÇÕES MEDICAMENTOSAS:

Para alguém que está fazendo uso contínuo de alguma medicação de uso contínuo, é essencial que você saiba se alguma dessas interage de forma negativa com qualquer uma das drogas.

Para isso, abra um buscador da internet e procure por ""checador de interações medicamentosas"", ou clique aqui para abrir um. Estando na página do checador, digite o nome das drogas que você usa, e em seguida adicione as recomendadas por esse guia.

Só recomendamos adicionar usar alguma medicação citada aqui se você tiver certeza de que ela não irá interagir perigosamente com alguma das medicações que você já faça uso.

.

BENZODIAZEPÍNICOS: O ""ANTÍDOTO"" PARA O INSTINTO DE SOBREVIVÊNCIA

É natural se sentir extremamente ansioso durante esse tipo de evento. Alguns podem desejar tornar o processo mais fácil e confortável utilizando calmantes.

Beber álcool no dia da tentativa NÃO É recomendado, pois o corpo ""enxerga"" o álcool como uma toxina, e adicionar uma outra toxina além do próprio SN pode aumentar as chances de vômito.

Calmantes farmacêuticos (conhecidos como benzodiazepínicos) podem ser uma forma de reduzir a ansiedade e embotar o instinto de sobrevivência (SI).

De todas as medicações sugeridas nesse guia, os benzodiazepínicos são os únicos que necessitam de receita para a compra. Entretanto, seu uso é totalmente facultativo (opcional), já que eles não interferem em nada no funcionamento do SN. O propósito do uso de calmantes é apenas tornar o processo mais confortável.

Segue abaixo uma lista de benzodiazepínicos em seus nomes genéricos (com nomes de marca entre parênteses):
Spoiler: Benzodiazepínicos

QUAL O MECANISMO DETALHADO DE AÇÃO DO SN?

O nitrito de sódio gera metahemoglobinemia, que é uma causa incomum de cianose, que ocorre devido a presença significativa de metahemoglobina sérica.

A hemoglobina tem parte do ferro heme oxidado de ferroso para férrico.

A forma férrica tem menor afinidade pelo oxigênio, mas isto leva a aumento da afinidade da forma ferrosa, reduzindo a capacidade da hemoglobina de liberar oxigênio para os tecidos.

A principal manifestação clínica é a cianose central não responsiva à administração de oxigênio suplementar.

A molécula de hemoglobina é um tetrâmero formado por 4 tipos de cadeia: alfa, beta, gama ou delta.

Cada cadeia é constituída de um polipeptídio denominado globina, a qual é ligado a um grupo heme, um anel de protoporfirina IX com um único átomo de ferro no estado ferroso (Fe2+).

Cada átomo de ferro no estado ferroso pode se ligar de maneira reversível a uma molécula de oxigênio, resultando em um total de quatro moléculas de O2 transportadas por cada molécula de hemoglobina.

A metahemoglobina, assim como a carboxiemoglobina e a sulfemoglobina, corresponde a um grupo de desordens da hemoglobina denominado disemoglobina, ou seja, uma espécie de hemoglobina que não se liga ao O2.

A metahemoglobina forma-se quando ocorre um desbalanço entre as reações de oxidação e redução e o ferro passa do estado ferroso (Fe 2+) para o estado férrico (Fe 3+).

Além de não se ligar a novas moléculas de oxigênio, a metahemoglobina possui uma curva de dissociação deslocada para esquerda, em relação à curva da hemoglobina. Sendo assim, as moléculas parcialmente saturadas de oxigênio têm uma afinidade maior pelo gás, dificultando a liberação de oxigênio para os tecidos. Esse fenômeno gera leituras superestimadas de saturação de oxigênio, tanto pela oximetria quanto quanto pela gasometria.

A diminuição da oferta de oxigênio para os tecidos decorre em acidose metabólica e o sangue adquire coloração marrom-chocolate.

Casos de metahemoglobinemia em adultos ainda são raros e geralmente induzidos por ingestão de agentes químicos que oxidam o ferro dos grupamentos heme além da capacidade dos mecanismos regulatórios do organismo, como o nitrito de sódio.

A formação de metahemoglobina já ocorre naturalmente, porém enzimas como NADH e NADPH são responsáveis por reduzir as moléculas de metahemoglobina e manter níveis séricos abaixo de 0,2%. Esse processo ocorre principalmente por duas vias enzimáticas: redutase de metahemoglobina dependente de NADH e redutase de metahemoglobina dependente de NADPH, sendo que essa última tem o azul de metileno como cofator que é transformado em leucoazul de metileno, metabólito responsável pela redução da metahemoglobina a hemoglobina e restituído a azul de metileno novamente.

Agentes fortemente oxidantes como o nitrito de sódio têm a capacidade de acelerar o processo de oxidação da hemoglobina, sobrepujando a capacidade dos sistemas redutores e levando a um aumento dramático de metahemoglobina sérica.

Dependendo da quantidade de nitrito de sódio ingerida, níveis alarmantes de hipóxia tecidual ocorrem, com elevado grau de morbidade.

.

EXECUÇÃO DO MÉTODO

- Adquirir nitrito de sódio (NaNO2).

Observações:

O SN pode ser adquirido em mercados online famosos (a forma mais comum de comprar), em lojas de reagentes, lojas de artigos industriais, produtos alimentícios ou lojas de química.

Deve ser que nitrito de sódio puro e com o teor de pureza de no mínimo 95%.

Não confunda nitrito com nitrato, nem com sais de cura.

.

- Adquira um (somente um) destes: Metoclopramida [Plasil] 10mg, OU Domperidona 10mg

A Metoclopramida deve ser a escolha preferida.

A Domperidona somente deve ser escolhida caso você tenha alguma sensibilidade aos efeitos colaterais da Metoclopramida.

Essas medicações são comercializadas sem receita, em qualquer farmácia.

.

- Adquira Propranolol, 40mg, em sua apresentação comum (""de liberação rápida"").

Observações:

Se certifique de que o Propranolol está de fato em sua apresentação comum (""de liberação rápida""), em vez de estar na apresentação de liberação prolongada.

Essa medicação é comercializada sem receita, em qualquer farmácia.

.

Adquira Ondansetrona (Vonau), de 4 ou 8mg, de preferência em sua apresentação orodispersível.

Observações:

Essa medicação é comercializada sem receita, em qualquer farmácia.

.

- Adquira um (somente um) destes: Cimetidina 400mg, OU Omeprazol 40mg, OU Esomeprazol 40mg

Observações:

Essas medicações são comercializadas sem receita, em qualquer farmácia.

.

- Adquira somente um destes: um copo graduado de cozinha, OU uma seringa descartável de 20ml sem agulha. Se não houver de 20ml, pode ser de 15 ou 10 ml.

Observações:

Nenhum dos medicamentos sugeridos até aqui precisa de receita ou de prescrição médica.

Se você somente achar a medicação em uma apresentação de dose menor, não tem problema, porém tenha em mente que quanto menor for a dose, maior será o número de comprimidos que você precisará tomar no dia da tentativa.

.

- Escolher uma localidade na qual você estará garantidamente sozinho por algumas horas (pelo menos 2 horas sozinho, mas idealmente mais que isso).

.

- Planejar que sua última refeição seja leve, de fácil digestão e com pouca fibra alimentar.

.

Planejar de fazer um jejum de pelo menos 6 horas após sua última refeição.

Observações:

A duração do jejum ideal é de 8 a 12 horas.

Você pode beber água à vontade durante o jejum, sem exageros.

Caso você tenha diabetes tipo 1 ou outra condição que o impeça de fazer jejum, pule essa parte ou consuma só alimentos muito leves nesse período (fáceis de serem digeridos).

.

- Planejar de ficar 2 horas sem beber água no período anterior ao horário marcado para tomar o copo de SN (mas você pode beber água para engolir os comprimidos das medicações).

.

Tendo feito o jejum de 6-12 horas e ficado as últimas 2 horas sem beber água, agora chegou a hora de fazer uso das medicações, como descrito abaixo. Use pouca água para engolir os comprimidos.

- Tome somente UM desses dois: Metoclopramida (3 comprimidos de 10mg, totalizando 30mg), OU Domperidona (2 comprimidos de 10mg, totalizando 20mg).

Observações:

A Metoclopramida é mais eficiente que a Domperidona, portanto esta última só deve ser escolhida como opção caso você tenha alguma sensibilidade conhecida a Metoclopramida.

.

- Acione um temporizador de 40 minutos a partir do momento em que você tomou a Metoclopramida*

*ou 60 minutos, caso tenha escolhido a Domperidona como seu anti-emético.

Observações:

No final do temporizador, você beberá o copo com a bebida de SN.

.

- Tome somente um destes: Cimetidina (2 x 400mg ou 4 x 200mg, totalizando 800mg), OU Omeprazol (2x40mg, 4x20mg ou 8x10mg, totalizando 80mg), OU Esomeprazol (2x40mg, 4x20mg ou 8x10mg, totalizando 80mg), logo após ter disparado o cronômetro.

.

- Faltando 30 minutos para o momento de beber o drink, tome Ondansetrona em sua apresentação orodispersível (8mg)

Observações:

Por se tratar de apresentação orodispersível, você não precisa de água para tomar Ondansetrona, já que esta se dissolve na boca e pode ser engolidor com saliva.

Caso você esteja sob efeito de antidepressivos (como sertralina, fluoxetina etc), não use Ondansetrona.

.

- Enquanto o tempo passa após ter tomado as medicações, vá preparando os copos que contém as bebidas de SN.

.

- Em um copo, acrescente de 50 a 100 mililítros (ml) de água.

Observações:

O objetivo é usar o mínimo de água possível que ainda permita dissolver o SN completamente.

Se o SN não dissolver, acrescente um pouco mais de água e agite com a colher.

Uma maneira barata de ter um medidor de água é usando um copo agraduado ou uma seringa descartável de 20ml sem agulha para medir a quantidade de água. outra forma é preenchendo de 1/4 até pouco mais de 1/3 do copo de água. A maioria dos copos genéricos cabe 200ml de água, então de 1/4 a 1/3 será o equivalemente a aproximadamente 50-70ml de água.

.

- Esmague 10 comprimidos de propranolol (10 x 40mg, totalizando 400mg) e os acrescente à bebida.

Agite para misturar e dissolvê-los parcialmente.

Observações:

O propranolol não precisa ser dissolvido completamente (isso significa que ele não precisa desaparecer - algumas partes dele ainda podem ser vistas na bebida).

.

- Abra o pote de SN.

.

- Acrescente ao copo, de 25 a 35 gramas de nitrito de sódio.

Observações:

Colheres de sopa podem ser usadas para fazer a medição. Recomendamos usar a seguinte medida: 1 colher de sopa cheia, e mais 1 colher de sopa rasa-média. isso alcança uma quantidade aproximada de 25-35g.

Caso tenha mais de 100kg (220 libras), utilize uma dose próximo a 35g, que pode ser tanto quanto 3 colheres de sopa intermediárias de rasas a cheias, dependendo do tamanho da colher (há variação entre as próprias colheres de sopa, dependendo do fabricante da colher).

Não confunda colheres de sopa com outros tipos de colheres (colher de sobremesa/chá/café).

Balanças de precisão podem ser utilizadas, mas não são necessárias. A dose de SN recomendada aqui é calculada para ser muito acima da quantidade letal, portanto ter precisão aqui não é necessário.

A dose letal de SN é 0,1g pra cada quilo de peso corporal da pessoa (5g para alguém de 50kg, 10g para alguém de 100kg etc...

É assim que uma colher cheia se parece:


.

- Agite para dissolver completamente o SN.

Caso o SN não esteja dissolvendo, acrescente um pouco mais de água e ele dissolverá.


Caso este tenha vindo empedrado, quebre as pedras de SN com a colher para poder dissolver. Caso não se dissolva, acrescete um pouco mais de água e agite mais.

Imagem de um copo com a mistura SN + água (repare que o SN está completamente dissolvido, a água mudou de cor mas o SN ""desapareceu"")


.

- Prepare pelo menos 3 copos, de forma semelhante a essa que você acabou de fazer com o primeiro copo.

Observações:

Você só tomará 1 copo. Os demais ficarão de reserva para serem tomados em caso de vômito.

Caso prefira, você pode acrescentar Propranolol somente no copo principal, já que dessa forma o preparo dos copos reservas será mais rápido.

.

- Quando o temporizador acabar, beba o drink de SN.

- Caso seja necessário, beba um copo reserva.

Boa morte viagem!

Perguntas & Respostas:

P: O SN é um método pacífico?

R: Relativamente pacífico. Há desconforto mas este é mínimo.

Os sintomas mais comuns após tomar SN são: náusea (vontade de vomitar), cefaleia (dor de cabeça), hipotensão (pressão baixa), tontura, letargia, sonolência, fraqueza, etc

.

P: O SN possui antídoto?

R: Sim. O nome do antídoto é ""Azul de Metileno"", que pode ser administrado por uma equipe de emergência, embora os hospitais não tenham costume de estocar esta substância, devido ao fato de que envenenamentos por nitrito de sódio ainda são ocorrência raras.

.

P: O SN é eficiente? Mata mesmo?

R: Ele é extremamente eficiente. As únicas falhas das quais a equipe do The Peaceful Pill eHandbook está ciente são casos nos quais houve intervenção médica.
.

P: Se eu for levado ao hospital e por conta disso sobreviver a uma tentativa com SN, ficarei com sequelas permanentes?

R: Não. O SN é seguro em caso de falha. Todos os sintomas que você sentirá após sobreviver serão temporários.

Essa é uma das melhores qualidades do SN e nisso ele se destaca de muitos outros métodos, como Monóxido de Carbono (CO) e enforcamento por exemplo.

.

P: Devo adquirir SN de grau alimentício ou grau laboratorial?

R: Ambos são válidos para o nosso propósito.

O importante é se assegurar de que o teor de pureza é maior do que 95%, e de não confundir SN com nitrato ou com sais de cura.

.

P: Esses remédios precisam de receita pra comprar?

R: Não. Todos eles são de venda-livre para o público, em qualquer farmácia.

.

P: Esse método funciona se eu tomar só o SN?

Depende. Caso você o vomite, não funcionará. Para o SN funcionar, é necessário que ele permaneça em seu estômago por tempo suficiente para descer até o intestino delgado e ser absorvido. Por conta disso, o uso de anti-emético (como o Plasil) é considerado essencial.

O SN é o componente letal, então ele pode funcionar por si só, caso você não o vomite, mas tomá-lo sem anti-eméticos aumentará as chances de vômito.

.

P: Esse método é caro?

Atualmente o SN custa em torno de 30 a 70 reais, dependendo de qual loja você comprar.

As medicações mais importantes são baratas, que são o Plasil e o Propranolol.

O Vonau é caro, mas não é essencial. para o método.

.

P: O gosto da bebida de SN é ruim?

R: Sim. O gosto de substâncias letais, em geral, é ruim. Por comparação, ogosto do Nembutal é muito pior do que o gosto do SN.

.

P: Posso usar suco, refrigerante ou outro líquido qualquer para fazer a bebida de SN?

R: Não! Use apenas água pura!

.

P: Se o SN é o componente letal e é o SN que mata, então por que usar Propranolol?

R: O Propranolol é um potenciador, mas não é essencial.

O Propranolol aumenta a hipóxia indiretamente por bloquear a resposta cardíaca compensatória que ocorre durante a hipóxia. Em outras palavras, quando o cérebro percebe que há pouco oxigênio disponível, ele manda uma mensagem ao coração para que esse bata mais rápido, gerando maior circulação sanguínea, para que chegue mais oxigênio aos tecidos e órgãos. porém com o propranolol presente, essa mensagem é bloqueada. Portanto o Propranolol potencia o SN, aumentando sua toxicidade, mas isso não significa que o SN não é letal sem Propranolol.

.

P: O Stan disse que o Propranolol serve somente para reduzir o incômodo que a taquicardia causa, ou seja, tornar a tentativa mais confortável. Isso é verdade?

R: Não. O Propranolol é, de acordo com o PPH, a forma mais eficaz que existe de potenciar o SN. potenciar significa tornar ele mais letal, mais eficiente como veneno. Nós usamos o PPH como base para recomendar o Propranolol. O PPH está mais atualizado do que o guia do Stan.

.

P: Por que é recomendado fazer jejum e ficar 2 horas sem beber água (com excessão da água usada pras engolir medicações)?

R: Para que a absorção do SN ocorra de forma mais rápida possível.

O SN se oxida facilmente, como já foi informado aqui. Essa oxidação é algo que nós queremos minimizar, visto que nitrato não é nem de perto tão venenoso quanto nitrito de sódio.

A metoclopramida acelera o esvaziamento gástrico, o que, somado ao jejum, também contribui para que o SN seja absorvido rapidamente.

.

P: Por que usar anti-ácidos no método SN?

R: Para diminuir a perda de SN que acontece quando ele se encontra e reage com o ácido estomacal (HCl).

Para os nerds, a reação entre SN e ácido clorídrico (ácido estomacal) é a seguinte:
3NaNO2 + 2HCl -> 2NaCL + NaNO3 + 2NO + H2O

Não há ácido suficiente no nosso estômago para converter a dose total de SN que tomamos, portanto o uso de anti-ácidos é totalmente opcional.

.

P: Por que a dose de SN recomendada nesse guia é muito acima da dose letal para humanos?

R: Para garantir maior rapidez, eficiência e confiabilidade no método, de forma que a pessoa não sofra mais que o necessário.

.

P: Qual a função da Ondansetrona?

R: Reduzir as chances de vômito. Ela ""bloqueia"" (antagoniza) o receptor 5-HT3, prevenindo vômito.

Algumas medicações de uso contínuo fazem a mesma coisa (antagonizam o 5-HT3). Se você estiver fazendo tratamento contínuo com, por exemplo, Haloperidol ou Mirtazapina, você não precisa de Ondansetrona.

.

P: Há riscos de efeitos colaterais com a Ondansetrona?

R: Sim, como todo medicamento.

Não se deve usar Ondansetrona caso você esteja fazendo uso de antidepressivos, pois há risco de causar ""síndrome serotoninérgica""; se for esse o seu caso, planeje sua tentativa sem ondansetrona.

.

P: Domperidona ou Metoclopramida apresentam risco de efeitos colaterais?

Q: A Domperidona geralmente é muito bem tolerada. seu risco de efeitos colaterais é mínimo.

A Metoclopramida tem maior potencial de causar efeitos adversos, porém é uma medicação mais eficiente em termos de reduzir as chances de vômito.

Qual delas escolher, é uma questão de análise de custo:benefício. Nós recomendamos Metoclopramida pra maioria das pessoas, a não ser que você possua alguma sensibilidade a ela.

.

P: Por que somente devemos abrir o pote de SN no dia que formos utilizá-lo?

R: Porque após o pote ser aberto, o ar leva água para o SN e este passa se oxidar lentamente, transformando-se em nitrato (que não é venenoso). Seu teor de pureza será lentamente e progressivamente reduzido.

.

P: Se eu abrir o pote mas fechá-lo imediatamente, selá-lo com algum tipo de fita, é a mesma coisa que manter o lacre inviolado?

R: Não, não é a mesma coisa.

.

P: Se eu abrir o pote, fechá-lo e usá-lo somente depois de 30 dias, ele ainda funcionará?

R: Sim. A oxidação é um processo lento.

.

P: É normal o SN estar empedrado e levemente amarelado?

R: Sim. Essas são características normais do nitrito de sódio.

.

P: O Stan citou que o ""protocolo de 48 horas"" também é uma opção no caso da Metoclopramida, além da ""stat dose"".

R: Sim. Você também pode seguir o protocolo de 48 horas se quiser. a vantagem disso seria que a pessoa teria mais tempo para saber se seu corpo tolera bem o Plasil.

Já a ""stat dose"" (30mg, 40 minutos antes de beber o drink de SN) tem a vantagem de ser mais simples e de ter menos riscos de efeitos colaterais.

Pra quem for fazer em regime de 48 horas, basta tomar 1 comprimido de Plasil (10mg) a cada 8 horas durante as últimas 48 horas que antecedem a tentativa (ou seja, 3 comprimidos por dia nos últimos dois dias).

.

P: Faço uso de diário de inúmeras medicações (""polifarmácia""). Como faço para saber se uma das medicações que uso não interferirá nos medicamentos sugeridos pelo guia do SN?

R: Uma opção é utilizar um checador de interações medicamentosas, como um dos seguintes (clique na opção para abrir o link):

Opção 1 (em português): Greghi (clique para abrir)

Opção 2 (em inglês): reference.medscape

Opção 3 (em inglês): WebMD

Outros checadores podem ser encontrados na internet utilizando os termos ""drug interaction checker"".

Estando na página do checador, basta adicionar as drogas que você faz uso continuamente, e e em seguida, adicionar as drogas que você pretende usar durante sua tentativa de CTB.

O checador informará sobre qualquer interação em potencial.

Outra opção seria manter o protocolo de SN o mais minimalista possível.

Nesse caso, as primeiras medicações a serem retiradas do protocolo deveriam ser a Ondansetrona (Vonau) e o anti-ácido (Cimetidina, Omeprazol etc). A Metoclopramida (Plasil), por ser essencial ao método, deve ser a última a ser removida, ou então substituída por Domperidona.

Já os efeitos colaterais do Propranolol não importam tanto quanto o das outras medicações, pois o Propranolol é dissolvido na própria bebida do SN, o que significa que a pessoa só sentirá os colaterais por poucos minutos antes de perder a consciência.

.

P: Posso fazer uso de álcool no dia da tentativa para que isso me ajude a vencer o instinto de sobrevivência (SI)?

R: A resposta curta é Não.

O álcool é uma toxina, e o SN também. Ter duas toxinas circulando ao mesmo tempo só aumenta ainda mais suas chances de vomitar.

Para vencer o SI, utilize algum benzodiazepínico, caso você tem acesso a um.

Ao contrário das outras medicações recomendadas nesse guia, os benzos precisam sim de receita médica, então não são todos que terão acesso, mas sua utilidade é muito grande no que tange a vencer o SI.

A dose pode ser a maior dose possível, desde que não faça você dormir nem prejudique suas habilidades de preparar o método corretamente.

.

P: Eu tenho úlcera no estômago, isso seria um problema nesse método?

R: Sim. O SN é um sal e pode causar ardor na sua úlcera estomacal.

.

P: Estou fazendo tratamento de esquizofrenia ou outro transtorno psicótico. Faço uso de anti-psicóticos, que também bloqueiam dopamina, assim como a Metoclopramida. Eu preciso mesmo usar Plasil?

R: Não, você não precisa.

Anti-psicóticos como os listados abaixo já funcionam como anti-emético.

Exemplos: droperidol, benperidol, trifluperidol, espiperona, haloperidol, broperidol, lurasidona, sertindol, paliperidona, risperidona, olanzapina, clozapina, quetiapina etc.

Obs.: Muitas drogas dessa lista só agem como anti-psicóticos a partir de determinadas dosagens. Por exemplo: quetiapina em dose baixa (usada para tratar insônia) não é um anti-psicótico.

.

P: Pretendo CTB somente daqui a algumas décadas e tenho receio de que o SN possa ser proibido até lá. Fale mais sobre o armazenamento e a vida-útil do SN.

R: Em questão de armazenamento, o SN se destaca. Quando armazenado corretamente, ele tem uma vida-útil quase infinita.

A data de validade que o fabricante estipulou não importa, aquela data serve somente como um período no qual o fabricante garante que o produto manterá suas propriedades, e não significa que o SN ""estraga"" depois de 3 anos.

Você precisa lacre original (o lacre de fábrica) intacto - essa é uma das mais importantes medidas para garantir uma vida-útil longa para a sua amostra de SN.

Como foi dito, romper o lacre faria com que o nitrito de sódio (NaNO2) lentamente se oxidasse em nitrato de sódio (NaNO3), tornando-o ineficiente como agente de suicídio.

Com relação a temperaturas, não há preocupações especiais. O SN não necessita de refrigeração. Ele é muito estável. A temperatura ambiente é adequada, mesmo em dias muito quentes ou muito frios.

.

P: Posso usar ibuprofeno para aliviar uma possível dor de cabeça que apareça após tomar SN?

R: Sim.

.

P: Se o gosto do SN e vômito pode ser um problema, que tal colocar o SN em cápsulas?

R: Não considere a opção de colocar o SN em cápsulas para não sentir o gosto salgado na boca, pois isso além de não ajudar, pode atrapalhar. O corpo humano ainda irá reagir ao envenenamento de qualquer forma, independentemente se foi em água ou em cápsulas. Há também o potencial de fazer com que o SN seja lentamente absorvido no seu sistema, o que poderia extender o tempo da morte significamente.

P: E injeções intravenosas? Enemas (administração pelo reto)?

R: Administrar SN usando injeções não é recomendado. O SN é um sal. Injeções de SN fariam você sentir muita dor e você precisaria de equipamento hospitalar para conseguir fazer isso.

Enemas não são ideais e também não são recomendados.

.

P: Ouvi dizer que há a opção de fazer o ""teste do aquário"" ou o ""teste do sangue"" para testar a pureza do SN. Devo testar o meu SN?

R: Isso não é necessário. O produto vem com laudo técnico atestando o teor de pureza, e foi comprado em um mercado legítimo (e não no mercado-negro). Por se tratar de produto legal, barato e comum, simplesmente não há incentivos para falsificação, adulteração ou golpes, como haveria em um mercado sem regras e sem a possibilidade de utilizar o sistema legal, como é o caso do mercado-negro.

.

P: Eu não moro no Brasil, moro no exterior. Aqui não é possível comprar anti-eméticos sem receita. Há alguma outra alternativa de anti-emético de mais fácil acesso?

R: Como o vômito pode ser um problema no método SN, anti-emético é considerado essencial. Portanto, faça o que for preciso para conseguir um, de preferência a Metoclopramida.

Dito isso, caso o acesso não seja possível adquirí-la, você pode optar por anti-eméticos de segunda linha, como por exemplo Dimenidrinato (Dramin. que é tomado na dose de 100mg, 30 minutos antes de beber o drink de SN) ou Cannabis (Maconha, que é fumada poucos minutos antes de se tomar a bebida de SN). Estes anti-eméticos são menos eficientes que a Metoclopramida, mas são opções de segunda-linha para caso você não tenha acesso a ela.

P: Tem alguma megathread na SS para brasileiros?

R: Tem sim. Clique aqui para abrí-la.

,1759352,gcso,"Oct 24, 2022 at 3:11 PM","Ei.

Eu abri meu nitrito e fechei rapidamente. Sabe me informar se tem algum problema? Obviamente, tirei o lacre para abrir, mas fachei com toda minha força.",,,,,,,,
,1759370,Ethereal Knight,"Oct 24, 2022 at 3:47 PM","acredito que sim. uma vez aberto, o SN passa a se oxidar lentamente, se transformando em nitrato, de acordo com PPH.

mas esse processo demora muito tempo até transformar a amostra toda de nitrito em nitrato. não sei informar o tempo que levaria, pois o PPH não especifica e eu não tenho essa informação.

inclusive, se alguém souber, pode postar aqui em baixo com alguma fonte confiável principalmente de artigos científicos: a que taxa o SN se oxida em nitrato após ter seu lacre rompido e ter sido exposto ao ar?
não sei se essa questão já foi estudado alguma vez, mas temos o PPH, escrito por médicos, que afirma que, uma vez que o lacre for rompido, a oxidação passará a acontecer lentamente e silenciosamente até tornar uma amostra inútil para propósitos de CTB (ele se transforma de nitrito - NaNO2, em nitrato - NaNO3).

se você for usar ele nos próximos meses, provavelmente ele vai vai estar bom ainda, já que muita gente utilizou potes que haviam sido abertos e tiveram sucesso - apesar disso ser evidência anedótica, mas omo dissemos, o processo de oxidação é muito lento.

evidência de deteriorização pode ser difícil de se inspecionar visualmente.

se você for usar ele daqui muitos anos, recomendo comprar um pote novo lacrado, pois a pureza do pote lacrado será maior do que aquele que foi aberto, SN é barato, e é bom aproveitar enquanto ele ainda é fácil de obter.

hipoteticamente, se sua única opção fosse usar um SN que foi aberto previamente, o que não é ideal, você fazer o teste do sangue colocando um pouco de SN em contato com um pouco de sangue e verificar se o sangue se torna cor marrom-chocolate. outra opção nesse caso, seria usar uma dose maior, algo como 35g, que é uma dose 5x maior do que o necessário pra matar um adulto de 70kg. mas não recomendamos usar um pote que foi aberto há muitos anos, especialmente quando se tem opção de ter um lacrado.

uma dúvida comum é, como muitos reparam que já tem ar dentro do pote de SN - ele não é selado à vácuo - então eles perguntam: ""como pode o SN não poder ser exposto ao ar, se já tem ar dentro do pote?"" porém as condições nas quais o SN foi fabricado são todas controladas, de modo a ter um desfecho (teor de pureza, de umidade, porcentagem de nitratos) relativamente previsível e padronizado, que é mais tarde atestado por laudo.

.

edit: não tem a ver com a sua pergunta, mas gostaria de aproveitar o espaço pra postar uma nova pergunta que não foi postada no post original e que é muito recorrente:

(de vez em quando vou acrescentar P&R aqui)

P: Posso usar uma mini-dose de SN, como 1g apenas, para testar os efeitos do mesmo?

R: Não! O SN, em sua forma pura como a que você tem em mãos, é tóxico em praticamente todas as doses, e essa seria uma experiência extremamente desagradável. Além disso, surpreendentemente, doses pequenas também podem causar morte, como já causaram no passado. Esse é o mesmo motivo pelo qual o SN é inadequado para tentativas teatrais. Não teste o SN nem mesmo em dose de 1g. Não se deve usar SN a não ser que tenha intenção total (100℅) de morrer.

.

P: Em vez de esmagar os comprimidos de Propranolol e dissolvê-los na bebida, posso simplesmente tomá-los nornalmente?

R: Sim. Eles também podem ser tomados junto com os anti-eméticos, de forma normal - ou seja, sem esmagar, sem dissolver, igual se toma qualquer medicação. Seu efeito persiste por algumas horas. Nesse caso, entretanto, pode haver colaterais como fraqueza, pressão baixa etc., que não seriam sentidos por tanto tempo se houvessem sido dissolvidos, até porque alguns dos efeitos do SN são similares aos do Propranolol.

Caso queira dissolver os comprimidos na bebida mas não saiba como fazer isso, você pode tirar um comprimido da cartela e usá-lo como teste: coloque-o na água e agite, observe se ele se dissolve sozinho - dependendo do fabricante, pode ser necessário esmagá-lo primeiro. Repita o teste com um segundo comprimido esmagando-o antes de dissolver. Isso aumentará sua confiança em sua própria destreza com o método.

.

P: Como saber se eu tolero bem o Plasil? Ou se devo substituí-lo por Domperidona. Irei ter reação extrapiramidal se eu usar Plasil?

R: Muitas pessoas não toleram a Metoclopramida (Plasil), por conta de seus colaterais, como as ""reações extrapiramidais"". Mas infelizmente uma das poucas formas de saber é testando, ou se recordando se você já teve reação desse tipo com medicamentos similares (bloqueadores de dopamina). Caso você não saiba, recomendamos tomar uma dose teste (10mg) de Metoclopramida em um dia qualquer, no período da manhã. Anote os colaterais. Mas fique tranquilo, a maioria das pessoas tolera bem.

Caso houver reação extrapiramidal, ter Dramin por perto pode ajudar, pois o Dramin é usado para tratar esse tipo de reação, na dose de 100mg, até um máximo de 200mg.

Já a Domperidona, é bem-tolerada e não costuma dar esse tipo de reação ou sequer ter qualquer efeitos colateral significativo.",1759352,,,,,,,
,1767151,Ethereal Knight,"Nov 4, 2022 at 4:57 PM","Pessoal, tem gente que acha que esmagar propranolol demora ou é difícil.

Vim aqui dizer que não é. em 2 minutos você esmaga os comprimidos rapidinho e com muita facilidade.

A forma mais simples é usando um utensílio de cozinha comum que temos em casa, chamado pilão com socador, como esse da imagem:


Basta colocar os comprimidos de propranolol dentro do pilão e ficar socando com o socador pra que ele seja esmagado. Depois é só passar o resultado pro copo com água.

Como eu disse, também dá pra tomar o propranolol junto com as outras medicações, em vez de colocá-lo no drink, e também dá pra fazer o método sem propranolol - todas essas 3 opções são válidas.",,,,,,,,

O problema disso é que o SN delas pode perder a qualidade e tornar o CTB mais árduo e propenso a falhas. O meu não veio com esse problema. Mas a primeira coisa que vc deve fazer quando ele chegar, é apertar um pouco o frasco pra ver se sai ar.

,2561633,FuneralCry,"Jun 15, 2024 at 7:34 AM","Actually wanting to exist truly would be absurd to me, I'd personally never be able to understand why anyone would wish for existence, having the ability to exist really is so incredibly undesirable and causes nothing but meaningless suffering.

To exist is so dreadful especially as there is literally no limit as to how much one can suffer, I don't understand those who act all confused as to why people would choose to end their own existence as wishing to not exist is all that makes sense to me. For me suicide is all that feels rational to escape from this hellish reality where chance so senselessly determines everything, there is no point or benefit to existence and I'd always prefer to not exist no matter what especially as after all nobody can be harmed by the absence of everything.

I'd never be able to get why anyone would want to suffer for decades just to deteriorate and die in agony from very old age which is all that existing leads to, it's so hopeless to exist and what disgusts me is when these people use their delusions to harm others. It's just so hellish how many procreate and wish to make existence into a prison where one cannot painlessly escape on their own terms, to me existence itself will always be the true problem and I'd never wish to exist under any circumstances, human existence to me is the most futile and torturous burden.",,,,,,,,

,2193749,Izzo 5617,"Oct 12, 2023 at 5:11 PM","I want to share why I am finding myself cornered into leaving this dimension sooner than later despite having been a successful photographer, relatively young (just turned 41), mother to a beautiful 11 year old... This story is stranger than science fiction and I need to tell it.

On October 18, 2022, I was poisoned/neurologically injured by a steroid called Kenalog-40 (four intermuscular injections in my back for minor pain) which destroyed my central nervous system, my sleep, my digestion, and my ability to be a mother/partner or work, leaving me alone to sit in a room basically 24/7, nearly unable to function. There are no words to describe the unbearable nightmare to which my existence has been reduced. From the day of the injections, I have had extreme other-worldly anxiety, debilitating insomnia (needed hospitalization), extreme panic attacks, depression, despair, pressure inside my brain, muscle twitches, muscle wasting, memory loss, paranoia, blood sugar issues, seizures in my sleep, excessive bleeding that lasted 6 weeks, leading to my having a belly full of blood and needing to have a fallopian tube removed (they said it was an ectopic pregnancy but so many others have had this same bleeding from Kenalog). I lost 26 lbs in 6 weeks and am still unable to regain it, I developed small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (can't eat anything besides chicken without pain), have lost at least 30% of my hair, daily crushing fatigue, compromised immune system and chronic infections, a sense of a decline in cognitive function, depersonalization/derealization, facial and body hair growth, and abnormal (giant) clotted periods. I had to go on Ativan for the anxiety and still can't sleep or function during the day without it a year later. I also have Lyme disease, a parasite called Babesia Microti, and now oral thrush, none of which will go away with antibiotics/anti fungals, which I can't tolerate.

Prior to these injections, I was back in school, studying psychology, double major with a 4.0, with only 9 courses left. Now my world has shrunken to something unrecognizable. I have visited every kind of doctor imaginable and all bloodwork comes up normal -an MRI and EEG also revealed nothing. My son was my everything, but now he stays with his dad, because staying here with me in a bed is too depressing and unhealthy for him. Other than this, I have no real support. My father is dead, my mother is very sick, my partner left because I couldn't stop begging him to help me go (most likely also agony from the benzo-induced akathisia). So now I sit here in this room, terrified, looking online for the best ways to end it… daily. It is unbearable, but I also feel that I deserve to die with dignity, not shot like an animal in a field, or poisoned with pills that may cause brain damage but not actually allow me to pass. Ultimately I landed on the Amiltryptaline/metoclopramide/benzo method from the PPHandbook... ordered those a couple of weeks ago but even as I am typing this, I realize how heartbreaking this sounds... and yet, I have missed every single holiday because of being trapped in a bed and spent 90% of the past year trapped in a bed in anguish. I can barely take care of myself anymore and as the days pass, I feel I am losing more and more of myself and my mind. My body burns from inside, feeling like I am sunburned below my skin. I have autoimmune issues (a positive ANA), extreme muscle wasting (Kenalog eats muscle), and it still burns where they removed my fallopian tube. I actually desperately do not want to die, but I already feel dead. I am already not living, and sadly, the memory of the person I was has slowly been overwritten for everyone who loved me.

This is not a rash decision. I have been extensively researching this for about 6 months now. I had hoped that my symptoms would improve but it feels as though with each day, the world is becoming more and more ""tilted."" It's like attempting to view the world through a movie screen or having a glass ball around your head. It is nearly impossible to put into words. I wish that I could get some help from doctors but they have tried every possible medication (even anti-psychotics) but they only made the terror and depersonalization worse. Prior to this, I was not on any psych meds. Sadly, no doctor has been able to give a meaningful diagnosis. I have been to a neurologist, 3 endocrinologists, 2 psychiatrists, 2 gastroenterologists, a kidney doctor, an allergist, 2 gynecologists, not one doctor has even heard of this drug causing this kind of systemic reaction. It is more like a vaccine injury - a reaction to the toxic excipients in the steroid injections vs. the steroid itself (benzyl alcohol is known to cause brain damage), or a reactivation of dormant viruses. Prior to this I never thought twice about my health. Now I have such bad fatigue/ringing ears it is difficult to even leave the house. I can barely grocery shop for myself. And the latest discovery after I finally began walking again outside was that I can't walk without crippling pain because of something called AVN of the femoral head (avascular necrosis of the hip bone) which is yet another known side effect of these steroids (it started 4 weeks after the injections last October but had gone away for a bit, now it's back and has put me back in this bed).

The bottom line is, every single day is AGONY, like being lit on fire... AGONY. And yet I don't want to leave my son (who I have already all but lost)... My poor son has even told me before ""you're not the same person... when are you coming back?"" which is just soul crushing to me because I know what he means. All too well. Even when he comes to visit that one day a week, it's like I'm not here with him. I'm just not. We could not be any more disconnected and previously, we truly did have a beautiful life. But it was stolen ... by Kenalog and the benzo Ativan, which I can't live with and also can't live without (headaches, seizures, more terror, panic, insomnia).

I don't even fully know why I'm writing all this, I guess I just wanted my story told. Big Pharma and my own stupidity in not researching Kenalog injections cost me my life... and will most likely ultimately cost my son a mother (already has) and I am heartbroken over this and am crying even as I type these words. I want to stay, I am just so weary and broken and my light has all but gone out.

""Killing oneself is, anyway, a misnomer. We don't kill ourselves. We are simply defeated by the long, hard struggle to stay alive. When somebody dies after a long illness, people are apt to say, with a note of approval, 'He fought so hard.' And they are inclined to think, about a suicide, that no fight was involved, that somebody simply gave up. This is quite wrong."" -Sally Brampton",,,,,,,,

I've been spiraling and looking for answers. Not knowing what the truth is and not believing the lies I tell myself.

My dad was homeless for 12+ years and died of an overdose 2 years ago. He was a good man but extremely abusive aswell and beat every partner he was with. He beat my mom, fought cops, killed animals. Said he has ptsd but I think he was just a psychopath that used his diagnosis as an excuse. But part of him had a good heart and he helped me alot financially when he entered my life again.

-Now I think I am much WORSE. Got married with a girl who is also bat shit crazy. Cheated on her probably 15+ times. Never hit her, but manipulated, lied, and exploited her over and over again. We are still friends. We still hang out. We slept on an air mattress.

-I constantly lie and play the victim to get what I want. I blew through my dads money in excess of 100K traveling, partying, just being a piece of shit in general. Not thinking of anyone else. Thats been me my whole life.

But it seems more likely that it's like cutting a power cord, if your consciousness comes from your brain and all the signals in your body (in simple terms), then how would you even begin to be conscious of an afterlife?

my brain is inexorably tied to my body. any extreme pain in any part of my body will be suffered by my brain only . that's a horrible abomination a brain that can suffer unending unbearable constant pain. the only good thing is after my brain dies i can never suffer pain again or see through my eyes or have a thought ever again. that's what i want anyway .but i still have to avoid torture while i'm alive . only the living can suffer excruciating pain.

,2587218,bitofftoomuch,"Jul 6, 2024 at 12:28 PM","Background: I'm 28. I grew up in white suburbia and catholic school with conservative parents and as a trans woman it was a neverending nightmare. the boys locker rooms alone was harrowing enough but the general sense that nobody valued me destroyed my psyche.

My life stopped being pure misery after I left, but I could never secure myself. I've bounced around 12 different apartments in 10 years. I struggle with ADHD, which has made it gargantuan to deal with work/school and other essentials. This plus my insecurities has made forging close friendships or entering relationships near impossible.

Transition was a reprieve. I started in 2021 and found a renewed energy. I entered grad school and quickly made friends. I got into a couple of romantic relationships. They ultimately did not stick but felt like progress. My living situations were precarious. My six-month lease that I'd hoped to extend could not extend as the landlord was moving on with their life and no longer renting the place out. The next place I went, I also signed 6mo and hated it enough to not extend.

My 11th living situation was probably the only chance I got at a happy life. I moved in with another tgirl who was having a rough time. At first I felt it overwhelming. She's very open with her emotions and I didn't know how to react. But over time I found she did not expect anything from me, and that I could electively provide support when I found it possible. She also supported me.

Last year she got laid off, and I tried to be cool about it but the more time went on the more I found myself panicking. I had just finished grad school and was applying for jobs of my own. We renewed our lease and I felt quite depressed. I was supposed to be moving on with my life in a bigger city, was what I'd thought. But I sucked it up and kept applying. We'd bring other friends over and watch her old movies on the shared TV. One day we all watched Legally Blonde together. My roomie told me I'm like Elle -- basically her way of saying I'm blonde, girly, beautiful, and smart. It breathed life into my job hunt. I started interviewing more charismatically. My dream job turned me down, but a very solid option said yes.

Re-entering the workforce was of course exhausting for me. And I was already tired from everything else that had happened to me -- my parents' rejection, watching many of my other friends simultaneously leave the city when I graduated, the years of unstable housing, the acquring of massive college debts. I felt things should be ""better"". And I didn't like the stress of wondering what would happen to my still-unemployed roommate who didn't seem to have much of a plan beyond clicking on a few linkedIn Posts once a week. This is where my mistakes began. I started emotionally closing myself off from her. I would be brief, rude even when we interacted. I kept thinking I just need to leave this goddamn city and I'm letting myself be held down by someone I can be better than. What a fucking asshole I am! This woman was there for me at my lowest, and I thought little of her because job loss depressed her and I missed some of my other friends. There are other complexities to her, of course, and mentally I used the memory of rare outbursts from her at other people to justify my way of thinking, but it was self-deception. I was looking at her abrasive self-defense against harmful people and convincing myself it was a red flag, because I didn't want to confront my own insecurities.

It culminated in me finally leaving the place last February. I immediately regretted it. I sobbed on the couch before leaving. I went to therapy, talked through my feelings. We started mending our friendship, and made plans for me to return. After everything, a happy ending was still on the table for me.

But I was already too damaged. I got to questioning my return and froze up when it came time to actually sign. I felt I did not have mental capacity to accept OR reject the offer. I ghosted. Understandably, she took steps of her own and signed elsewhere. When she broke the news, I felt relief for about 1 minute, followed by crushing sadness, debilitating regret, and ultimately my 13th reason.

This was my once in a lifetime shot to be around someone who actually made me feel good even at my weakest, and how did I repay her and the universe? I spat in her face, apologized, promised I would be better, and then spat a second time.

There's no hope anymore. Work drains me and I no longer have the recovery time I once had with my bestie. On days off I mostly sleep and thinking about ending myself. I have massive tasks I need to do to keep my life on track and they feel far too overwhelming. The idea of tacking a recovery on in addition to that is laughable.

People will say it's dumb, that I shouldn't end myself for blowing one relationship, but it isn't just one relationship. I've failed to get close to anyone in my 28 years on this planet. I feel like there's such horseshit in saying ""you're fine on your own"" because everyone who says that has people they're close to to fall back on. I do not. I have a handful of friends -- most of them living several hours away -- who don't know me nearly as well as this woman did. I am functionally alone most of the time. What life demands from me has once again outpaced my ability to recover and I'm all out of tricks up my sleeve to buy more time.

I'm bitter, mostly. Bitter I was dealt a pretty bad hand but also full of self-loathing for blowing the only shot I had.

My shrink told me it's not about ""what I deserve"" but that it's ""just the situation"" and honestly? i don't fucking care. that distinction does not transport me back to the only place I could ever call a home. that distinction does not make my friend forgive me and consider giving me a third chance. that distinction does not convince my boss to take it easy on me or lower the price of rent or make my debt disappear or bring love back into my life. the simple fact is I had a chance to feel like life was worth living, I blew it, and I may never get one again.

This time around, I just don't feel like finding out if another chance is coming. My life is intolerable -- I get overworked and made to feel like shit for how my disability slows me down. I go home to a void of nothing. the few friends in my area who spend time with me have little in common with me. I will likely burn out soon and I have zero finanical preparedness for that. It seems far more likely that my life will get worse than that it will get better. Why slog through it, why stick around and most likely just feel worse and worse about myself?

I have a big surgery coming up and it's basically the only reason I haven't CTB'd. I feel so fucking dumb, because if I'd just stayed put I'd know where I was recovering after the procedure, but instead I'm juggling an apartment search and dreading moving to place #13. my life is not only bad, but fucking embarassing and an alienating topic. I don't feel like I can talk about myself to friends because anything I say about ""what's going on with me"" will just look bad and bum us all out.

I want to stick it out til my procedure next month, because it too is special. But I can't even conceptualize my return ""home"" afterwards and I'm not sure I even want to. So that puts me in a weird and frustrating place in terms of my plans to ctb. part of my motivation is not wanting to go through the stress of another relocation. but to see through this procedure means figuring out the relocation. Perhaps I will just have to suck it up one last time and revisit all this in a few months. I don't want to go through another Thanksgiving, that's for sure.",,,,,,,,

I could improve myself in the ways I'm supposed to. Take a million pills, tuck away my strange, ugly thoughts, work hard till I die, fit in better, have more intimate relationships, keep trying to fill the time before I die with a rapidly shrinking supply of things I find interesting and stimulating- maybe I could seriously pursue a dream, find success, etc.

I don't want to live like my 25 year old friend or my father or any man I know. I don't want to live like any woman I know, either. I don't want to be anyone.

I think this is a very individual and philosophical question. I think everyone has the right to make their own decisions about ctb. Personally for myself do I think I need to have a solid reason? Yes I do, but that is a requirement I have for myself, and I think everyone needs to come to their own conclusions about this. For me personally there r also very specific reasons why I want to ctb, but for many that isn't the case, for many it is much harder to pinpoint something specific.

Personally having some good reasons was important for my ctb note yes, I felt the need to explain to the people that I would hurt the most, and do everything I can to lessen their pain and impact on their lives. A large section of my ctb note is devoted to absolving everyone's guilt, even though I personally privately think some of them are somewhat guilty and my ctb is very much due to neglect and betrayal by those that I trusted the most. However again that is a very personal choice, many also choose not to leave a note or leave a very simple note.

,2575022,Forever Sleep,"Jun 26, 2024 at 1:34 AM","In terms of a note, I've read articles on people who simply said that they didn't feel built for this world anymore. I think that's a good way of summing it up for a lot of people really. The reasons can be different but I imagine, we're all basically at this point because we practically can't, or can't see a way of making life tolerable for ourselves. I don't see why talking about feelings isn't enough. If you've been through therapy and drugs, that's surely enough to show people you were struggling and did try to pull yourself through for a time.

Honestly, I doubt many reasons would feel sufficient enough for a lot of people anyway. Asides from untreatable, chronic illness, I think some people view all other problems as solvable. So, maybe few of us will be able to leave an explanation that others will find justifies it.

Personally, I would still want to leave a note. Not so much to explain or justify it. I don't really think I should need to. I believe we own our own lives and have the right to do this. Still- more to say that no one could have helped. That I didn't tell them because I didn't want them to worry and ultimately try but fail to prevent me doing it. So- to try and prevent any possible guilt.

Also, to apologise. To say that I didn't want to cause anyone else pain. That I purposefully hung on for as long as I could for the sake of not upsetting others. (I've had ideation to varying degrees for 34 years.) But ultimately to try and put to them that it isn't exactly fair to expect someone to live a life they find intolerable purely for the sake of other people. (Unless they have dependents- in my view.) I'm probably going to ask them to try to feel relieved for me- if I pulled it off.",,,,,,,,

I've had difficulty with articulating my reasons myself, though I think I'm much better at it now than I was. I have similar thoughts, it was hard to describe ""I just don't want to deal with things anymore"" in a way that didn't sound lazy or silly.

You said you have been trying for a long time without results and are tired of struggling, and I think that is a good enough reason on its own. You could also generalize and just say there are a lot of other things that have all added up. Perhaps you can point to some broader categories like society or health and such.

On another note, like many people above said, once you are dead it's pretty much just oblivion which is something that the conscious human mind can't even imagine.

,2593861,subconscious,"Jul 12, 2024 at 9:40 AM","I've not had any luck CTBing with Argon etc; I think they've added a chemical which mimics CO2 for safety.

So a new approach: this question is about how to remove oxygen from air. I'm thinking, ideally some sort of chemical solution that reacts with any oxygen in air bubbled through it. I've been searching and searching on openlibrary.org but not getting anywhere, plus chatGPT, gemini and perplexity.ai are refusing to help.

Does anyone know of some chemical solutions that will readily react with any oxygen bubbled through them? The easier to obtain, and the safer/less toxic it is, the better, since I probably won't be attempting for a long time and want to just be prepared for the time when I want to go ahead.

What I'm thinking of doing is making a system with a hood that filters oxygen using the above method, and filters CO2 by passing it through a solution of NaOH. Hopefully that'll basically leave me with mostly just nitrogen and argon, and I shouldn't feel like I'm suffocating

Thanks!",,,,,,,,
,2593892,Kapsyl,"Jul 12, 2024 at 10:19 AM","Interesting, what you're essentially want to construct is a gas mask. But instead of purifying the air, you want to opposite by removing the oxygen.

I would suggest using a full face gas mask make instead of a hood, since the hood is constructed to be supplied with pressurized air so the inlet hose is severely under dimensioned for atmospheric pressure.",2593861,,,,,,,
,2593897,Not A Fan,"Jul 12, 2024 at 10:25 AM","Some argon is sold as a mixture (75% argon/25% CO2). Are you saying that you purchased 100% argon, and you believe they deliberately gave you the wrong product?

This is 2nd person I've read saying something like this and it doesn't make any sense. This isn't helium for balloons. These gases are used in the welding industry and have to meet very exact specifications in order to work.

You can't just put random extra chemicals in there and expect it to still work properly (unlike adding oxygen to balloons, for example, which doesn't affect anything.) Can you please give some more detail as to what made you come to this conclusion?

People sometimes underestimate SI (survival instinct) when trying to CTB with inert gas. There are some crazy stories on here. It's not the gas, it's your brain. (At least, that's my guess... because there's no way they're cutting 100% Argon for industry with random chemicals.)

One last point... Argon is probably one of the least-used methods for peaceful suicide. It surely hasn't gotten the kind of attention compared to SN, nembutal, helium. Unless there's something I missed, no media outlets have been sounding the alarm about ""dangerous argon gas child suicide"" quite yet. Even if this does eventually happen, it will more likely result in the same thing that has happened with nitrogen: you can no longer buy smaller-sized full tanks on the internet. But you can still buy large $400 nitrogen tanks. And you can still buy the smaller ones if you go into a supplier and purchase it in person.

I really don't think they are cutting anything into the argon. If I'm wrong on any of this someone please correct me because I'm still trying to figure all this out myself.",2593861,,,,,,,

Huh? A vacuum?? I don't think your understanding of physics is .... all that great lol. It would be nothing short of slow torture, not to mention hard to achieve anyway.

I had absolutely no fears when using Argon, so it's absolutely not SI. I was completely calm, and completely determined. But I experienced intolerable feelings of suffocation and had to rip off the hood each time I tried. I literally ended up buying 3 cannisters from different suppliers, assuming I'd encountered an unusual problem, but the result was the same every time. To try and establish what was going on, I did a few experiments:

Experiment 1: Firstly, instead of using a hood, which relies on sufficient flow of gas, and to eliminate possible psychological effects or SI, I did an experiment which absolutely had no chance of being fatal: I filled up a bag with argon. I breathed in gas from the bag, breathed out into the room, and repeated as long as I could. After about 3 or 4 breaths I felt like I was suffocating and had to stop breathing in argon from the bag. So this made me assume that unlike the product description, ""100% argon"" (or thereabouts, it was at least 99% iirc), it must have had some carbon dioxide that was making me feel like I was suffocating. So...

Experiment 2: I tried testing all the argon canisters for carbon dioxide. I can't remember what substance I used, but it was cheap and easy to get, if I remember correctly it was a blue colour. I tried bubbling my exhaled breath through it, and sure enough it changed colour, but bubbling fresh air through it did not - indicating/confirming the reaction was with CO2, so that confirmed that the chemical test was effective. So I prepared another test tube with the indicator liquid for each of the tanks, and bubbled the argon through it. For all three tanks, it was negative. So, most likely, none of the canisters had any CO2.

Yes, I'm fully aware that pure argon is required for many industrial processes, specifically not containing oxygen or carbon dioxide. That's why I said that while I doubt it is carbon dioxide in the canisters that's making me feel like I'm suffocating, that doesn't mean that scientists haven't found a gas they can add in small amounts to the argon that does not interfere with uses of pure argon, but is added for safety reasons to prevent not only accidental deaths, but also suicide attempts. I have absolutely no doubt that this is plausible. For example, with many recreational drugs, for example cannabis/THC, there are many different chemicals that all bind with cannabinoid receptors in the brain, yet their other properties can be very different. There are some synthetic cannabis chemicals that are literally THOUSANDS of times better at binding with those receptors than THC, so I really think this explains what I experienced. There must be some additive that has the same effect on suffocating feelings as CO2 but either given its other chemical properties, does not affect industrial use of argon (at least in the majority of uses, no doubt some scientific/industrial activities do require unadulterated argon, and I can imagine they'd want to make that hard to get, given we're living in a dystopian nanny-state world).",2594286,2593959,2593897,,,,,

,2596446,locked*n*loaded,"Jul 14, 2024 at 6:16 PM","I think my understanding of physics is quite remarkable frankly. You don't think you could construct a strong enough vessel, get in it, and then evacuate it (enough) whereby there wouldn't be enough air/O2 in the vessel to breathe? I could. Of course you wouldn't be able to achieve total vacuum, but, then again, that really wouldn't be necessary, would it? And torture considerations didn't enter into the ""equation"", so to speak. The OP opined about a method of removing O2 ftom air. Evacuation of a vessel leads to the same end. And yes, I do have an engineering degree.",2596433,,,,,,,
,2596451,subconscious,"Jul 14, 2024 at 6:18 PM","So it seems like the cheapest options are probably chemical absorption or combustion. The problem with combustion is typically when anything is burned in low concentrations of oxygen, carbon monoxide is made of carbon dioxide. and I was exploring this method of removing oxygen because I was interested in avoiding the unpleasant symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning such as headache, confusion and nausea. By removing the oxygen from air, in theory one could die completely peacefully.

So anyone got any ideas what oxygen-sorbent chemicals are readily available that aren't hard to get or scarily toxic or corrosive etc? I know sodium and potassium metal readily react with oxygen in air, but because they're so reactive they're very hard to get - every place I've ever looked at that sell them only sell to verifiable companies or educational institutions. Not only that, but they're expensive. If I wanted to evacuate oxygen from say a small shed, it would take at least a kilogram of sodium or potassium. Also, given they're very soft metals, I doubt you'd be able to get them in powder form to maximise surface area, in order to react with the oxygen and remove it in at most a couple of passes of air through the powdered metals. Ideally, the sorbent would be a solution that I can bubble the air through, without requiring heating or any other awkward precautions?
Not a chance. Atmospheric pressure is about 15PSI. That means if you create a vessel to withstand the pressure differential, the force of the air on each square meter of the vessel would be 40*40*15/2000 = 12 TONNES. Creating such a vessel would cost tens of thousands of dollars, and would require significant metal working skills and equipment. Sure, you don't need a total vacuum to die. But at the very least, you'd need to remove half the air. So the force per square meter would b 6 tonnes, but that's still an extremely huge amount. Basically, I'm just thinking about how people at high altitude can die - like when an airplane loses pressure at high altitude, people can die quite quickly. Thinking about it, I haven't heard reports of people suffering when dying from high altitude, so I guess it might not involve much or even any suffering at a non-total-vacuum - but yeah, it's definitely not the most practical method. Not by a million miles. Yes, being in a total vacuum would make you suffer, I guess that level of vacuum isn't necessary. But to create a vessel that is sufficiently strong, and has a door with a completely air-tight seal, requires significant money, and specific engineering skills which despite my knowledge of physics is just beyond my capability. Unless you have a ridiculously powerful vacuum pump, you basically need a completely airtight seal. Most vacuum pumps don't even come close to one litre per second, so that would take about half a day to evacuate something large enough to be comfortable to sit in. Any pump more powerful would be incredibly expensive given it wouldn't be anything close to mass produced. And given atmospheric pressure, just the smallest of cracks, flaws, porosity or whatever, would negate your efforts.",2596446,,,,,,,

I read about Carbon Dioxide poisoning which is very rare and it is probably one of the only methods I could do. I tried partial hanging but can't find my carotid arteries.

My plan is to take around 8 tbsp citric acid and 5 tbsp baking soda, put them in cup. And water in another closed bottle. Then I am not sure what I would do next. place both of them in plastic bag, (not sure how) and tie it tightly with rope and rubber band. Then pour the water in.

How long would it take to reach concentrations of over 30% and lose consciousness? I am not very good at suppressing the need to breathe.

is this strategy possible or am I getting something wrong?

Someone please help",,,,,,,,

The big problem with that is that it is a very harmful, oppressive — and even gaslighting! — ideology. There is no point in explaining this, however, because either people will get it or they won't. And the majority of people won't.

I'm not an advocate for FuneralCry's worldviews (for instance, I'm not pro-mortalist) or her attitudes, but she understood this point clearly and sharply. I trust this site's moderators are fair and competent and have certainly made a good decision.

In my opinion, you are biasedly and annoyingly preaching about the supposed virtues of life and of mankind. However, as disgusting as your opinions may be from my point of view, you are entitled to have and to express them.

The real problem is that you are being glaringly disrespectful towards @MatrixPrisoner. He never offended anyone directly in his response and has only expressed his own opinions.

You, on the other hand, are directly calling him a hateful and useless person because you disagree with him. Was that called for? I don't think so.

Suicidal pro-lifers complain that the forum is too ""negative,"" that people here are too ""hateful,"" that there's too much ""gloom and doom,"" etc., etc. They complain about the ""aggressiveness"" of FuneralCry without realizing that they are aggressively bashing, offending, invalidating and depressing people on a regular basis as well.

•What to do in the final hours?

Day 5 - Spend time with my mother helping around the house.

Day 4 - Get rid of things/throw away things that she won't need and tidy up my room.

Day 3 - Write my suicide note and schedule it to be emailed months after I CTB.

SN is not a substance that guarantees a good night's sleep for everyone.

CTB is the art of compromise.

SN does not usually cause (probably) very much pain, but everyone must expect at least some discomfort.

In some cases, SN is more unpleasant than in others.

It is difficult to answer clearly.

I chose SN because it probably won't be very painful and in my case it's easier to drink the ""poison"" than, for example, hang yourself.
Of course, other people may consider hanging themselves a better option.

Everyone must also decide what their pain limit is.

For example, I don't consider headaches, nausea, tachycardia, etc. to be a big problem.
If this is a problem for someone, they should think about whether they really want CTB using SN.

,2590778,KuriGohan&Kamehameha,"Jul 9, 2024 at 2:54 PM","This development solidifies what I need to do now. I know I can't live like this the rest of my life.

Several months ago I had a scan done at a private clinic (because the NHS continued to not do anything) which showed I had scoliosis, a lot of damage to my spine, and a brain abnormality. I got shamed by the NHS GP for using private by the way when they refuse to do anything for me, and essentially accused of playing doctor for going to ""unnecessary scans"" that weren't indicated when these useless clowns have ignored me for years.

For whatever reason, the competency of the private clinic was called into question and the hospital I was referred to decided they want their radiologist to consult the scans first before they will accept the referrals. Even though the private radiologist is someone with a lot of qualifications, experience, and even research publications, and I highly doubt the NHS one even looked at the scan for more than 2 minutes.

Well the NHS GP got back to me and said the hospital decided they are going to cancel all my referrals, because their radiologist decided that I don't have inflammation in my spine, and rheumatology will not accept any consults unless that box is ticked. That doesn't change the fact that my back is in shambles and something is causing deterioration. I also had a positive ANA bloods result before and the doctor said it is a meaningless test. Then, pray tell, why are you still performing this meaningless test???

The cherry on top is the neurosurgeon has decided that it is completely and totally normal to have a 5 millimeter, visible deformation of your brain, and that I am not a candidate for the only treatment to resolve this (surgery) because it is normal to have a chiari malformation and now won't even call it by that clinical term. Some people don't have symptoms, yes, but I very obviously do. So they basically shut the door forever to the prospect of getting the one thing that had any sort of potential to alleviate anything, and I won't know if it gets worse or I develop a synrix because I will not receive any follow up care.

Now, my official diagnosis is going to get changed back to Chronic Fatigue syndrome which means I won't ever receive shit. The next step apparently is getting referred to the useless chronic fatigue service which is literally just a conversation with an occupational therapist to discuss ""pacing yourself"" and accepting your permanently disabled life. No thanks.

I'm sick of this bullshit. If I were a cat or a dog, at the first sign of this I would've been given the needle, the cruelty of dragging out the process would've been palpable. Instead, I am expected to live a permanently impaired life where I never fully understand what's causing anything and am offered no help, except being told to deal with it mentally.

I expressed how frustrating it is to struggle with symptoms for years, to try many things, and constantly not improve or be fobbed off and I just got the canned, fake active listening responses from the doctor where they don't really acknowledge what you're saying except an, ""oh yes I understand"" and quickly jump to another topic to avoid having to address what you just told them.

There is nothing else I can do except kill myself unless I'm willing to accept a permanently impaired life forever. I have lost all hope a long time ago but this confirms everything I already suspected. I am expected to raw dog multiple illnesses the rest of my life and treated like a crazy person. This is so shameful and makes me lose all dignity.",,,,,,,,

The autism stuff is just ring a round the poses as well. It's been over a year and 8/9 months of it was wasted because the GP had no idea what to do apart from some ""support groups"" for autism. Cunt. Listen. I'm asking for diagnosis not talk with people. Even a moron could decipher that most people with autism don't like groups and people.

,2595034,KuriGohan&Kamehameha,"Jul 13, 2024 at 1:08 PM","Don't apologise, it's okay. I do have copies of them, but going abroad would probably cost tens of thousands of pounds that aren't available, unfortunately. I've looked into several places, and it seems like this field is full of scammers, with quack science like chiropractors regularly being promoted, and experimental surgeries that aren't actually studied in depth. Then there's some doctors that do the gold standard surgery for hundreds of thousands of USD.

The most commonly done surgery is extremely risky, invasive and not performed in many places unless you have an extreme case which is one reason why the NHS avoids it I suppose. I guess it speaks volumes about how niche and under investigated something is when half the patient advocacy groups are full of scammers promoting sham doctors abroad that do quack procedures like chiropractic adjustments.

I pretty much gave up when I realized that the main method that exists is solely an extremely crude surgery that they won't perform until you develop a life threatening complication. But I've just accepted that at this point, I'm gonna be in zombie mode the rest of my life and no one really cares.

Do you want the ASD diagnosis to feel like things are sorted and in order for you, or to access something else you need like benefits? Pretty much everyone I know whose tried to get diagnosed as adults had to ditch the NHS and shell out for private, but some of them got help with it, because they were trying to pursue higher education. Some universities or colleges that take adults will help people sort out a private diagnosis and sometimes even provide some financial assistance for it since they need the ""medical evidence"" to get disability accommodations. Maybe there is some low-key part time animal related education course/qualification you could get on that would facilitate that.

Unfortunately it's easier for them to fob you off and tell you to do mindfulness and go to groups or whatever than push the diagnosis forward. The same thing happened to me whenever I tried to access any sort of PTSD service and get it put on paper again, since they refuse to document my old diagnosis for some reason. They pretend like I didn't mention that and keep bringing up irrelevant conversation about joining ""women's social groups"" before quietly adding that there is not really any PTSD help anymore. It's all one generic CBT service that everyone gets referred to, Talkworks. They even got rid of the local support group for survivors of sexual abuse for no reason, so I never even got to go to that either, if I had wanted to.


People like that neurologist shouldn't even have a job, in my opinion, if they can't even have a pittance of empathy for two seconds or brush aside their bulging ego to admit that there is something they don't understand, rather than surmising that it's nothing.

Yeah I've been getting blamed for years by my partner for ""not trying enough."" It never seems to end. I will have all the tests done, they'll be inconclusive, doctors won't do anything, and then it's always my fault because I'm not continuing to fumble in the dark more with the medical system after I get told they don't know. I am not joking when I say I've probably had over 20 phone calls with the GP this year and they have no clue, they'll refer somewhere, the referral gets denied because I am missing one specific marker in a blood test or scan and the consultant decides I'm not sick enough for any diagnosis or treatment, then it's back to the drawing board of nothingness again.

From doing extensive research of my own too, it doesn't seem like there's anything I can do. But people tell me just don't give up, just keep trying, I don't know exactly what I'm supposed to try when all options have been exhausted. It's this weird limbo where I'm absolutely not allowed under any circumstances to kill myself, but because doctors don't know what to do and I don't know what else can be done I'm expected to just deal cause, ""it could be worse/fatal.""

I think the average doctor is just too stupid to understand that just because they can't find a specific pathology that correlates with tickboxes of x criteria means you have y disease, doesn't mean the symptoms and impact on quality of life suddenly stop existing. They act like this should be thrilling news to someone who is still experiencing deleterious, harmful symptoms. When it clearly isn't.

The other day I got recommended a video by a former surgeon (trained at an extremely prestigious US hospital) who quit his job doing spinal surgery because in his own words, ""the people who recovered from having back pain ate right exercised and socialized, but the ones who didn't don't make good lifestyle choices. Therefore doing spinal surgery is often a financial scam and I don't want to participate in unnecessary scams anymore."" And people in the comments ate that right up. A person with clear spinal pathology is not going to be cured because of their social life or diet, sure it might slow things down or help aid in healing an injury, but I couldn't believe a supposedly top surgeon now believes all spinal surgery is useless because a number of patients he consulted with one or two time no longer needed it. What even is going on in the healthcare industry anymore.

I hope you are doing any better now, it's a complete disgrace. I went through the same thing, though fortunately the final cost of my procedure wasn't as expensive as anticipated. The NHS definitely wouldn't have performed my surgery in the way I got it in the end, because it requires a high level of skill, and they had let my tumor grow to a size bigger than a grapefruit at that point.

So I completely understand how dazed and angry you must feel about having to shell out so much money for a private procedure and tests, when the NHS really should just do their jobs in the first place.

Looked back through my posts and remember you commented on my thread about 青木ヶ原 forest, I know you lived in Japan for awhile and the doctors there must have made you livid with their kampo, gaman tsuyoi mentality, and other bs. I hope your health is doing a bit better since your treatments in the private hospital.

I lived in Japan for a good few years but the critical health condition hit when I was in the UK. I had to leave everything behind since I was bedbound and had return to my homeland with family.
The worst part of having a ""rare"" illness is that the people around you don't really understand. I can't blame them but feels very isolating.

Empathy erosion is a serious problem and as far as I understand all environments that doctors work in starting back in medical school foster that process.

Validating symptoms is something a lot of doctors really have a lot of problems with and clearly isn't something that is emphasized in their education.

Now who do I turn to to make the suggestion that that change?

But people just don't care in general. They just don't care. Maybe that's justifiable because people's capacity to care is limited necessarily but then that also limits the demands that they are entitled to make of you.

Unfortunately I do not know much in this field so unlike other first posts in a megathread, I cannot give you the information you are coming here for but I trust in a matter of time this will be a place of great information

Without speculation, if you know thr Dowling for a FACT, please comment below:

.best rope (thickness, material type)

.best knots for noose and to secure

.best place to put it around your neck

.any other important information you think will help

Please make this into something supportive . If people are here it is becuase they think this is the best method, please do not list all the bad things about this method. Every method has its flaws

Thank you.",,,,,,,,
,1807965,NHLTradeRumor,"Dec 14, 2022 at 6:29 PM","Full suspension hanging relies on using your body weight to compress your carotid arteries, therefore cutting off circulation to your brain, and rendering you unconscious within 20 seconds if done right, and death within a max of 15 minutes after that. You will need a rope of good thickness that doesn't stretch, and can support a couple times your weight, because the human body will thrash around as it dies. The knot should be placed behind your neck for a full suspension hanging, and a simple slipknot may be better than the hangman's noose based on what I've heard on ASH. The thing you tie the other end of the rope to will need to be strong, and at least a foot higher than your height. A rolling hitch or two will be used to tie the other end to the support. You'll need 2 or 3 feet more rope than your height, at least with 1 inch thick rope. It will be painful, but not like you'd think, and passing out will come quick anyways, assuming you do it correctly. From my testing, it's not that painful, even calming in a way, but SI is still a bitch, and I don't have much advice for that. A good rope to use is 1 inch thick manila rope, as that's what I've used during my testing, and it works perfectly. You will want the rope above your adams apple, as close to your jaw as you can get it, as that's there the carotid arteries are most 'vulnerable'. Having a small bit of padding may help with the rope cutting into your neck and pain related to that, but only light padding, like a washcloth. Most of my information comes from a year of browsing alt.suicide.holiday, and anecdotes from the internet, as well as my own testing.",,,,,,,,

,1842862,Damnation,"Jan 19, 2023 at 10:14 PM","For full-suspension with a short drop (like stepping off a stool), because it's the only one I've researched and tested myself:

A slipknot is better than hangman's noose because it's easier to tie and adjust, for anyone wondering.

Polypropylene rope is also frequently recommended, it's strong, resistant to stretching, and smooth.

You can find some jump-ropes that are the right size and material if you want something discrete.

A lot of people use pull-up bars, over-the-door hangers, closet rods, and clothing racks as anchor points.

You can also tie one end of the rope to a doorknob and drape the noose-end over the door to use the doorknob as an anchor point.
-- I don't recommend doing this unless you're fairly light and have a round doorknob. Not every doorknob (or door and hinges, for that matter) can support a person's weight.

Always test the hell out of your rope and anchor point.

Shoelaces and belts pretty much do not work for full suspension. I don't recommend them at all.

Some people overcome SI (the fear of stepping off the stool) by hyperventilating to induce syncope, which can cause you to blackout and fall.
-- I've heard that huffing compressed air can do this too, but I don't know much about that.

You can also try alcohol, sleeping pills, or sedatives to overcome SI, but for me personally, the dizziness and nausea make it worse. You might want to experiment first, especially if you can't afford to ""miss your deadline""

I don't recommend intentionally depriving yourself of sleep to try to ""sedate"" yourself. Sleep deprivation makes a lot of people anxious and paranoid.

This is NOT a silent method. Hanging causes convulsions and sometimes noises from strangled breathing (even if you're unconscious), so make sure you're going to be alone for a good while.",,,,,,,,

,2114478,CW36,"Aug 10, 2023 at 4:04 AM","Good to see a megathread about a serious approach to hanging. A few things to add which might be of use.

1. Grease the noose and your neck with petroleum jelly (preferably) or soap, to help reduce any friction and make both as cinchable as possible.

2. Go into the noose hard and fast to constrict the carotids as quick as possible. This cuts off the carotids quickly, speeding up unconsciousness and leaving a much more placid pale appearance post-mortem.

3. Consider wearing gloves, a mouthguard and a blindfold. Gloves will help prevent any clawing at the neck and further increase the futility of escape. A mouthguard will help reduce the chances of biting your tongue. A blindfold will help reduce the fear induced by the changes with the eyes I.e. from bright lights to total darkness. It'll also take away something from the horror for whoever finds you.

That's all for now. If I think of anything else I'll add another post.",,,,,,,,

,2116122,inmyhead,"Aug 11, 2023 at 8:45 AM","Thought I would add to this with my experience. I got BDSM rope off Amazon as it's softer and it worked well. I opted for a full suspension hanging using a cupboard rail as an anchor point but I can't remember the name of the knot I used there. Then a slip knot for the actual noose.

I pulled the noose over the cupboard door. It's important to note this is a built in cupboard in my room so the door was as sturdy as a room door. There was no chance of the wardrobe moving, if that makes sense. It's an old sturdy rail too.

I stepped off a chair and immediately started to feel dizzy as my carotid artery was compressed. SI kicked in INSTANTLY and I was trying to pull at the knot to loosen it. Naturally it didn't. The slip knot was foolproof.

Unsure how long I was hanging for. But when I had used the knot on the rail the rope had initially been too long. So I had looped it back around again and tied it less securely. That knot gave way and my feet landed on the ground. My body was spasming as I landed and it took a moment to come back to reality.

If it hadn't been for that looser knot at the anchor point I would very much be dead right now. That was enough for me to realise I didn't want to die and I haven't attempted since. I think the main reason for that is that I know if I do that again I am 100% going to die. So I need to be really sure about it and right now I'm not.

But it is a fairly foolproof method you just need to ride out the initial SI once you drop.",,,,,,,,

,2130962,CW36,"Aug 21, 2023 at 6:08 AM","Just to clarify a point of confusion I've seen on other hanging threads. Both of these particular knots are actually the same thing, although the method of tieing is different. The 'slip knot' here has been labelled incorrectly, and is actually also the 'noose knot'.

A slip knot is tightened at the tail end, which is of little value here. A noose knot is tightened at the working end, meaning it'll cinch tight under load, and can't be undone from the tail end, making it the perfect choice for complete or incomplete hanging.

Despite the drawing being labelled inaccurately, I still recommend using it over the video as your template, as it provides a double wrap and is easier to follow in any case.

I hope this helps!

,2131119,Worndown,"Aug 21, 2023 at 9:16 AM","You need to plan full hanging. It is simple but the rope, tie-off (anchor)point and height all need to be correct.
Take a little time to review your plan. Test knots and anchors. Under tension, the rope may stretch more than anticipated. Give yourself enough height to ensure your feet are nowhere near the floor.
You need a good slip knot. An Overhand Loop Knot eill tie a small loop in the end of a rope. Put the other end through it and make sure it slides easily. This is key to a fast pass-out and that is key to success.
When you gently step off, you will hang and the ""noose"" will tighten. This compresses arteries and you pass out.
Six minutes later you are no longer a viable human. Thirty minutes later you are guaranteed dead beyond all hope of being ""saved"".
Make sure you have the alone time needed. The stories of people that did it all right and passed out, only to wake up in the arms of their ""savior"" are crushing.
None of them complained about pain or hanging there forever. There are too many of these posts out there. Research, ask questions and be successful.",,,,,,,,

I was dreading this, because it's too much work, and the biggest issue is the anchor point, but I have finally found a good anchor point, and I'll share it with you and would appreciate it if you guys give me some feedbacks.
Let me walk you through it.
I am anchoring to a ladder, and the rope will be fed through a window which I'll show later, I am weighting the ladder down with some weight, equivalent to my weight, so it wouldn't move much, and I'm securing the weights down with a rope and two half hitch knots, which is a secure knot in my opinion, that's the only part I'm worried about a little bit, I'd like to know if there is a better knot for this situation?
If this part of the setup is okay, then I'll be moving on to the second phase, which would be setting up the rope.
It's kinda tricky to get it right as I have to stand on stairs, but I have figured it out.
I'll be sharing pictures of the rope/second part soon.

And what noose are you going with? I'm using the noose knot, cause it won't come loose at either end.",,,,,,,,
,2135557,DaysOfTomorrow,"Aug 24, 2023 at 5:00 PM","Thank you very much.
I think it does bring creativity, because before this, I thought it'd be impossible to do a full, since I couldn't see any anchor points, but after thinking it through, I came up with this...
I weight 60kg, and the weights themselves are exactly 60 kg, the ladder would weight about 10-15kg, so 75kg in total, more than my weight.
And as for the noose, I am going with the noose knot/slip knot, I have put my whole weight on it and it works just fine.
Also I would like to thank you for pointing out the blindfold, I never wanted to do this at home, because of the trauma that it brings, however, blindfold could reduce that trauma significantly, because it's always about the eyes...

You gotta breath in as much air as you can breath out all of it as fast as you can to the point of exhaustion.
Then stand up and hold you nose tight and try to not let any out of your mouth while exhaling.
You will feel your heart beat In your head you will feel your stomach cramping but don't give in keep trying to exhale after about counting to 9 in your head the body gives in and you feel like your slipping and fall down.
The unconsciousness lasts for about 5 to 10 seconds it's not long per say but if you do it with a rope around you it's pretty much game over as the rope will push down your neck at full force and get you back to being unconsciousness.
It's all about keeping the exhaling going during standing thats the hardest part you gotta push your self not to stop.
As to how it feels I had a massive headach and weak muscles.

The interesting part is why some people manage to do this and not hang them self I think it's context.
Most people even those who wish to CTB still fear death it could be very difficult to force your stay still on a rope.

I myself am not sure what method I want to use, I still have a long(ish) time before i will ctb so in the mean time I go over as many methods as I get my hands on and read about them and experiment with them.

,2583725,JenX,"Jul 3, 2024 at 9:23 AM","Thx 4ever. You are so sweet! So here's what's been going on. I'll try to be concise. I made up an excuse for not paying rent & said Id pay on Friday. I've learned why so many people prefer to poison themselves rather than hang. Lol. It's really hard, I think especially if you don't really want to go…

But I don't like hanging partially from high. You flop around a lot. It's seems pretty violent. And testing it out I don't see how you really make it pain-free with the knot in the back. I've done all the tips and tricks and, it effing hurts.

Niw what I'm going to try out today in a couple of hours is the door knob. There isn't good information out there on how you go about doing it. But I found a picture that I had missed the first time around in the hanging thread. It shows how it can be done. Although this guy did it from his bed, it would definitely work for my door knob.

This would take out the flopping around in the air when in convulsions. Also I like that the slipknot is in the center front of the neck. It better simulates in my view the blood chokehold. No need for padding. The trachea and windpipe won't be crushed because there's less pressure where the knot is…

And I can do the hyperventilation and Valsalva maneuver and just lean into it when I start to black out. We'll see.

Its surreal planning all of this out and knowing it really really needs to end soon. Tick tock. A dark cloud is over me. And I'm literally having flashbacks of things I haven't thought of in years. Interactions with various people. It's like I'm saying goodbye.

And if this doesn't work, I'm going have to go with the 3 tablespoons of table salt. You do pass out at some point because of the loss of water in the brain, but I don't know how long it takes. Hopefully it would just be maybe 30-60 minutes or so but who knows. It does sound excruciating. I don't recommend this.

I don't recommend any of this to anybody. If you are healthy and you have money, for god sake there's so much beauty in the world. Look at some nature channels, go out in nature , get sun on your face, get curious about stuff, find out how electricity works. Get out of your own head. Help your neighbor do some thing… I digress. Lol

This just really sucks.

Here's the picture that showed me how to do it from a door knob even though it's not on a door knob. They may not allow this, but unfortunately I didn't save the link. You can find the link to the picture somewhere in the last third of the hanging thread I think. The man is laying down, on his side, beside his bed hanging from the headboard.",2583219,,,,,,,

I've been depressed for some time, I just can't talk about it… as much as I really want to tell someone and get into detail about it… I can't. I hold so much inside about my personal life. I'm just going to say it… I don't even know you but for whatever reason, I don't want you to take your life. I know this is probably not what you want to hear. I just can't shake the feeling. I don't even know what country you live in, your age, I know nothing about you other than you're suicidal due to unpaid rent. I can't stop thinking about your situation and to be completely honest, I have this need to encourage you to live. Why? I have no clue. I don't want you to suffer, but I also just as badly want you to live. I don't understand myself and why my brain thinks the way it does and why I care so much about people I don't know. I don't believe in God, heaven, hell or an afterlife. I just feel too much for myself and others and it hurts so much. This world is so full of human and animal suffering it absolutely breaks my heart. It seems like the people who suffer the most are some of the most realistic and the most caring and empathetic people on this planet. Maybe that's why it hurts so much to witness someone leaving this site, forever. I strongly believe the most beautiful people in this world are suicidal because they feel so much of everything… particularly pain and suffering. I want so badly to fix this world and stop everybody's suffering and it hurts so much that I can't snap my fingers and make it happen. I know this probably sounds corny, but I love the song, ""Imagine"", by John Lennon. I wish the world could live by every lyric in that song. The biggest problem in human suffering is that we don't help each other enough. I wish the world was more like that song.

I'dneed nothing short of a miracle. In the next 24 hours. I've been waiting for one, I've extended as long as I can… Must be my time though and I have to come to terms with that.

I have to confess I was so excited about passing out by breathing into my clenched nose I didn't watch the first video you posted and that's what that guy did. But he was much quicker than me. That was fairly incredible. How did he do that… Was it because he just had a cigarette. It's too bad we can't hear what he said or understand if we knew the language.",2584197,2584197,,,,,,
,2584263,4everHeartBroken,"Jul 3, 2024 at 6:37 PM","I was thinking the same thing with that video… and what was in that cigarette?! lol I'd REALLY like to know what he was saying (and thinking) and if he'd known he'd go that easily, perhaps by practicing? He didn't look like he suffered at all once he lost consciousness (you can see close to when he loses consciousness as his arm falls).
If I can find a way to allow myself to just pass out alone, I think partial hanging would be fairly easy to do. Perhaps that's my fear. Once I realize that I can induce unconsciousness upon myself, then I know it would be way too easy for me to just tie a rope off and go peacefully. Maybe my very own mind terrifies me. I know if I could just get myself to pass out, then that's my gateway to the real deal. I'm sooooo envious of people who can make themselves pass out so easily! I've become somewhat obsessed with partial hanging due to this. I keep thinking, ""If so many people can leave so peacefully, then why can't I do the same?""

I'm becoming slightly interested in SN… but that just seems like a LOT to learn and understand and I have no clue how to obtain it. I would love to get some just to have it in my vault so I can leave whenever I wish. Just the idea of simply having it stored away securely in my house sounds so comforting. I don't understand how SN isn't available to every adult over 25 with a fully developed brain. I don't think I'm any exception. I believe there's a LOT more of me who simply just want SN just to have it close to them for comfort to leave peacefully, when we want to and how we want to. I think a time will come when most developed countries will have this right, I just can't believe it's taken this long for some countries to even CONSIDER making it legal.
Sorry for going on too much. I just hope something changes for you this week where you can find financial peace. This sounds like an extremely common problem. I don't know why every human being isn't housed properly. I'm sure the reasons are different in different countries, but it's definitely a HUGE problem that NEEDS to be addressed.

I didn't want to be like some here and woken up hours later with bloodshot eyes and broken capillaries… I've been trying for two days now to pass out from the noose alone or at least close to passing out, which would mean it could kill me and can't do it. I suck at hanging. Lol. Damn. I wish they would tell us how all of these people are hanging from door knobs but there's literally been a cover up. For good reason I suppose but it sucks.

So onto the sure thing, just a bit of suffering on my end. I don't know how much or how long, but death is certain. No chance of being a vegetable…Good old table salt. Murder by Morton. 3 tablespoons. It's dissolved now in water waiting for me to hold my nose and swallow it down. I live alone so I won't be interrupted. From Wikipedia I am to expect jitterness nausea and confusion. I've also read diarrhea and lots of peeing. Lethargy which is good. Then loss of consciousness, seizures, coma, death. I'll finally find out how long it takes to become unconscious from acute salt poisoning.

I don't think I'll be sharing my experience unless it's super bad, there's just too many young people on here. And salt, well everybody has salt. It isn't challenging to get like SN. Plus hospitals aren't very good at saving people when there are interventions. They've saved only one salt poisoning that I know of, a college guy who downed a bunch of soy sauce as a fraternity pledge. Nobody else was so lucky.

The confusion goes beyond porn, but it is a major contributing factor in my confusion over whether I am straight or not. Am I sexually attracted to women or are these feelings a byproduct of my views on women being screwed by the constant objectification and sexualization of the female body? I still remember the first pornstar I saw back when I was in grade 5. I was searching up some stuff on this Japanese idol group and that eventually led to her popping up on my screen. I was completely infatuated by her and I wanted to click on the videos of her but was too scared. I would look her up and stare obsessively at the video thumbnails but the idea of seeing her have sex made me feel bad and I didn't want to watch her have sex with a man. I would look at naked images of her but I would always end up using my hand to cover her body up because seeing her naked made me feel dirty.

Sometimes, I also think that it's screwed with my perception of myself and my own body and has caused me to further view my body in a sexualized manner.

the mere fact that you have to work to be able to receive necessities in order to sustain survival or comfort. but I cannot accept living
in a reality or society that essentially coerces us to do so. Especially a society that condemns
suicide even while more humane methods are more readily accessible to grant those who are not willing to partake in such an event.
One they did not ask or couldn't have asked for. Who would willingly choose to live on a earth that requires you to give up most of your day to something you would
never do willingly wouldn't you rather not be apart of a world that forces you into such a dilemma were the only other option
in life is shame, starvation, homelessness

this system is being used to coerce and gain control over people
if you don't pay your income tax the government uses threats of imprisonment or taking your possessions away
to persuade an unwilling person to pay up obtaining money from you by using force and threats.
the government is robbing you of 20 percent of what you earn at work then they tax you further on everything you buy by a value-added tax rate of 20 percent
the system is designed in such a way that you are under constant threat of becoming homeless or going hungry if you don't keep going to work every week to earn money to pay your bills, it's a form of enslavement like going into debt it's a form of bondage
this system is a slave system because there is no opting out of paying taxes that are used for all kinds of things that are beneficial but also not beneficial like wars

It could be argued that pre-historic ""primitive communist"" society was the closest to non-oppressive we've ever been, but it was a time with low technology and thus full of natural suffering rather than political suffering. And marxists argue that there will be a golden age after state communism (socialist states) has transitioned into ""full communism"" which is a ""stateless, moneyless and classless"" world but with all the technology that was invented under capitalism and state socialist states. But I also think this is a pipe-dream. And I think these marxists would even admit that there will still be laws enforced violently under such a system. So things like police and prisons and oppression would still exist then.

I believe the ideal system would be an anarcho-pacifist commonist world (by commonism I mean beyond communism where BOTH bourgeois property AND even personal property should be shared by all). It's important that this is anarchist AND pacifist, which I think are mutually exclusive (because if violence is allowed then someone will always be oppressed and someone will always be the oppressor and thus cannot be anarchist at all; anarchist militias are an oxymoron). I think such a system has all the answers...

BUT... even my above ideal system I am pessimistic about myself, because I don't think humans, the way we are now, will ever be loving enough to allow each other to live in such a peaceful non-violent cooperative world, which is why I am very sympathetic to your post and argument.",,,,,,,,

,2348696,RainAndSadness,"Feb 8, 2024 at 12:26 PM","Hi everyone. Just out of curiousity, a while ago there was a report about this forum where the CEO of the Canadian Mental Health Association said that ""[...]there is no value to this site, it doesn't benefit anyone - in fact it does quite the opposite[...]"", defending the position that this forum shouldn't exist and it made me curious, is that true? Like, that person is obviously talking down to us, over us, pretending they know what we want, when they claim this forum doesn't benefit anyone despite there being clearly a demand for website like this one, right. And it seems to me people are making an account and participating here voluntarily, so I'd assume there must be some value to this website for the people who are using it. It's also important to fact-check these claims given this person seems to speak for the CMHA and it would be interesting to know if these people even remotely understand what goes on in the minds of suicidal people, if they understand what our needs and desires are and how we want society to treat us.

It seems to me these people think want to be treated like children and have other people decide what we're allowed to see and research online and what decisions we're allowed to make while I do think that people who use this forum want some degree of autonomy and a right to make their decisions regarding their own welfare and decide for themselves how they want to live this life and when they want to leave. That's how I want society to treat me, I found this forum in 2018 when I was in need for information to make my own decisions and a supportive community and I didn't agree with these experts that other people should have a right to tell me, as an autonomous adult, what I'm supposed to see online and which decisions I make for my own life, concerning my own welfare, are valid and appropiate and which aren't. I think these are deeply personal decisions and essentially nobody's business but mine. And I have a feeling that's echoed by a majority of people in this community.

So let's solve this dilemma. What do you think? I'd be curious to hear your opinion, feel free to explain your position in the comments below.",,,,,,,,

Like 'findingquiet' just said though- I suspect it's very prolonged and painful. I think with these sorts of things- slow deaths, you have to consider how long you think you could put up with pain, not knowing 100% you will actually die from it and, not be tempted to call for help. I suspect it also depends on your own health. Someone with poor health already is going to be more likely to be affected. Like always with DIY methods, it's all the unknowns that trouble me.

Sorry for my bad English. This thread is the result of 5 months of research, practicing partial hanging and figuring out how to reduce the pain. Just because it works for me, doesn't mean it'll work for you.

This is exactly how I'm going to CTB, so I'd like to hear your thoughts about this.

I recommend reading the Hanging article on Suicide Wiki first.

Equipment
Required items for the method.

Rope
You'll need a rope strong enough to hold your body with low stretchability and high flexiibility. Materials that cause more friction will be better for this method. Enlarge the picture below and look at the texture. Ideally that's what you want. A hemp rope should also be fine. I don't recommend using anything else, such as belts, cables, sheets etc. Their differences in texture, surface area, flexibility, stretchability and strength will only make it harder for you to succeed. Partial hanging is already a risky method, there's no need to introduce even more potential points of failure when ropes are cheap and easy to buy.

If you can't order a rope without someone else knowing, order it to a PO box (or a similar service in your country). If your parents don't respect your privacy, you can hide your rope inside your PC if you have a non-transparent case.

I'll use 2 meters of 12mm braided polyester rope. Its advertised breaking strength is 2,590 kg (5,709.98 lbs) and the stretchability is about 7% at 50% load. The rope is soft and nice to touch.



Anchor point
A round object that's strong enough to hold your weight. Can be a pull up bar, tree branch etc.

I'll use a telescope pull up bar, which can hold around 100 kg (220 lbs).

Padding
Since pain won't be an issue here, you don't need any padding. If you're really afraid of having marks after failure, you can use a soft plastic bag, and that's exactly what I'll do. Anything else will only make it harder for you to succeed.


Constricting the carotids properly
It's very helpful to be able to tell whether your carotids are property constricted in just 3 seconds. You won't have to wait 30 seconds hoping to pass out, only to end up with a headache and bloody eyes.

I've seen a lot of people on this forum having problems with fully constricting their carotids. There is a way to make it much easier by moving your head back, as shown in the video below.


What does it feel like?
Your vision gets darker and you experience a very pleasant and addictive feeling, especially after the blood flow is resumed. No tingling, hearing voices or pain.

The only way to know how close you are to passing out is by counting seconds since the pressure had been applied. Loss of consciousness happens suddenly and without any warnings signs (other than what I described above).

Test run
Before proceeding, make sure you're in a safe position where you won't hurt yourself after passing out. I recommend laying down on your stomach in a bed.

Move your head back, position your thumbs on your carotids in the middle of your neck and push. If done properly, you will experience what I described above. In about 8 seconds you will pass out and will regain consciousness after about half a second. If you feel pain or don't feel anything, move your thumbs down a bit and try again.

I recommend maintaining the pressure until you pass out, just so you can be 100% sure you constricted the carotids properly. If you involuntarily stopped maintaining the pressure, you just passed out. You probably won't remember the exact moment you did that though. You may also feel that it was survival instinct, but it wasn't. Record a video of yourself doing it if you don't believe me.

You will have a mild headache after doing this.

Survival instinct
Compressing the carotids for about 6 seconds may temporarily affect your brain's ability to think, which might be helpful for overcoming the survival instinct. This is only a theory and hasn't been proven.

Knots
Anchor point
Snuggle hitch - Wikipedia
en.wikipedia.org

If you feel like the hitch is not safe enough, repeat steps 3 and 4 one or more times.

Noose
How to Tie a Slip Knot? Tips, Uses, Steps & Video Instructions
What is a slip knot, how to do a slip knot- step by step diagram with instructions, tying tips, what is it used for, how do you make a slip knot video guide, images
www.101knots.com
During step 3 wrap the end 3-4 times more
During step 4 pull as hard as possible
The resulting knot must be hard to tighten and loosen, otherwise you won't succeed with this method. It shouldn't loosen itself at any point. If it does, wrap the end even more times or consider using a different rope.




Positioning the rope on the neck
The noose needs to be positioned correctly on your neck, so that it can easily compress your carotids without any pain, while also not sliding up.

In this part you'll need your rope to be attached to your anchor point. For testing purposes it doesn't have to be very strong. Be very careful when practicing - you definitely don't want to pass out accidentally.

The knot (the part marked as red) goes in the back. Make sure it's in the center even after tightening, otherwise your carotids won't be constricted properly.
Put the noose as low on your neck as possible, hold it in the front (marked as yellow) with one hand, push it down so it doesn't move up, and tighten the knot by holding the red part with your other hand and pushing your body forward. If you feel pressure in your head, you tightened it too much. Loosen it a little.


Grab your skin above the rope and pull it up. The knot shouldn't loosen. Do it for the front, left, front left, front right and right of your neck while pushing the rope down below where you're grabbing the skin. Your skin should be now stretched and folded up above the rope, which will prevent it from sliding up. It's the same mechanism that makes removing a tight ring from your finger difficult.

Hold and push down down the front again and tighten the knot as much as possible. You should begin feeling pressure in your head. This is the most dangerous part, as the pressure on the carotids may be enough to make you pass out, and the knot is difficult to release without adding even more pressure in a state of panic. Move your head forward to reduce the pressure if you need to.

Your rope should end up approximately in the middle of your neck. Take your hand off the rope. If you now move your head back without tilting it, your carotids should be completely constricted. If not, tighten the knot even harder or start over. The knot shouldn't loosen.


Body position
There are three different painless positions you can choose from.

The red circle is where you should tie up your legs. This will prevent you from moving one leg and lifting yourself up on it. Instead, you'll have to move two at the same time, which is much harder. I don't think you can do this while unconscious, but it's better to be safe than sorry.

There's very little room for movement in these positions, so they're much more reliable than for example normal kneeling.

Kneeling with knees off the ground
In order to end up in this position after passing out:
Hold onto a door frame (first picture) or something else (second picture)
Stand on your toes
Bend your knees as much as you can before the rope stops you. If they touch the ground or are close to doing so, adjust your snuggle hitch.
Move your feet back as far as you can




Sitting in air with straight legs
You'll need a chair or something similar for this one. Put the chair behind you, put your hands on it and lift yourself up. Lower yourself to the point where the rope stops you. If your butt touches the ground or is close to doing so, adjust your snuggle hitch.




Standing
I don't recommend this one, as it may be easy to accidentally stand up during convulsions. If you do end up choosing this position, you should bend your knees as low as you can before the rope stops you. It'll take more force to stand up. If your butt touches the ground or your feet or is close to doing so, adjust your snuggle hitch.




Reliability
Partial hanging is a very complicated method if you want to do it painlessly and there's a lot of room for mistakes. I believe I thought about and prevented the most common points of failure.
The positions are much safer, there's less room for movement and accidentally saving yourself during convulsions.
The slip knot has no way of loosing itself, assuming you tied it correctly.
The rope won't slide up the neck easily.
During my first month of attempting partial I also had unreliable setups that had no possibility of ever working. For example, attempting to hang myself with a cable in the kneeling position. Fortunately, I never succeeded due to not being able to close my arteries. Now I see a few problems with that setup:
The cable could slide up the neck.
The cable could snap.
The slip knot was not tight. The moment I stopped pulling it down with my body, it would loosen immediately.
All I had to do to release the pressure was to lift my butt up. Doesn't seem that hard to do accidentally when your entire body is convulsing.

For example, what might seem a trivial and impulsive reason to one person, may have been the final straw to another. They weigh up the pros and cons but it's just too much, which shows rational thinking.
Or in other cases people say someone's reasoning is illogical and irrational. But if that person can weigh up the reasons, consequences, pros and cons and have evidence for this. Yet others still don't understand their logic, who are they to decide it's not rational ?

,2590990,escape_from_hell,"Jul 9, 2024 at 6:19 PM","The living being is the only one that can assess the pros and cons of their own living state.

The criticisms of others are considerations.

Those others are not the being in question, and will seldom if ever have a full picture of the suicidal being's state. They can only relate as a fellow being. For example, a pro-life apologist may have lost all four limbs and went on to become a cyborg superhuman billionaire with a beautiful loving family and circle of friends. So, they might tell a suicidal person: ""your pain's not that bad. So what, you only lost your fingers on one hand, I lost all my limbs! Yet look at me now, never been better or happier! Therefore it is not logical for you to do this!"" But that survivorship bias may blind them, aside from the lack of direct experience of course, to the suicidal person's other grievances. Perhaps they practices hobbies like guitar or painting or something where the dexterity of those fingers was crucial, and additionally is unloved and uncharismatic with pathetic social skills, in stark contrast to the survivorship bias cyborg.

Also, each person is different. One person may quite literally get trapped in a deep dark dungeon that fortunately has a stash of water and palettes of peanut butter, enabling them to survive for months. Another person may have a peanut allergy and die from simply being in the room as it gets warm and peanut fumes escape some questionable jars.

So, for one person to say another's state of suffering is invalid, because the pro-lifer lost all their family, lived alone and homeless for 50 years, prospered in the peanut butter dungeon, had cancer 300 times, was attacked by a gang of scorpions, bullet ants, and murder hornets on dozens of occasions, mauled by a bear, parents hated them and beat them from day 0 until their death then came back as zombies to torture them more, so on and so forth, but overcame all those things easily thanks to some source of resilience genetic or otherwise developed and is now living high so hey, there's light at the end of the tunnel for everyone. It still doesn't add up. Another human is a different human. Built different.

A different person might stub their toe and it flood their brain with incredible trauma and fuck them up permanently. Sounds extreme, because it's not common. But you do not know until you are that person. And when you are that person, on top of all your suffering, you will be constantly gaslit about how ""it's not that bad, you crybaby whiner pussy loser. David Goggins will show you the way! No excuses be tough or else we'll send you to the psych ward to scare you straight!""
Irrational death might be a decision made in extraordinary circumstances such as intense inebriation. If you are able to understand that you are in an altered or temporary state, then it really does make sense to wait it out a bit. Of course, you can always wait it out as long as you feel able. Not everyone will be able to wait it out like the cyborg survivor, so self-analysis is in my opinion one of the most rational forces one can employ.

,2591250,Forever Sleep,"Jul 10, 2024 at 12:32 AM","I think that judgement in part is made on someone's circumstances. Which I agree- is unfair. What one person may seem to be ok to tolerate in life may feel excruciatingly bad for another person. Ultimately, it's that person who has to live that life. Pain is so hard to guage too. How do we actually know how much pain and suffering someone is going through?

Plus, I think very importantly, choice comes into it. Maybe there is a possible cure to whatever ails them- be it bad circumstances, poor physical or mental health. Just how effective will that 'cure' be though? Will it really 'cure' their problems? What will they have to endure for it to work? How long for? Surely, it's also up to them as to whethet they want to put themselves through that.

Where I think we all find ourselves on thin ice is when pro-lifers pull out their trump card- mental health and mental stability. Many will insist that most if not all people with ideation are suffering from a mental illness which severly affects their ability to think rationally.

Maybe there is something to this- if we have depression and anhedonia, we are bound to have an excessively negative perspective on life. Possibly a distorted perspective. Ultimately though- I think it still has to be up to the individual. Plenty of people here know and freely admit they have depression or other mental illnesses. Plenty have had or are undergoing extensive treatment. How's that going for them? I wouldn't say entirely successfully if they are on here! In which case- I think people should view it the same as physical illness- if it's treatment resistant- likelihood is, all that person is going to do now is suffer. Why expect a person to want to live like that?

In your case though, you have posted certain statements and ideas that some of us will find it difficult to perceive as rational thoughts. Eg. that you have and can feel a computer chip in your foot controlling you, that you need to decipher messages and act on them- otherwise your family members will get hurt, that you need to hurt other people in order to protect them. That you receive these messages/voices?

I suppose because the majority of people don't live with these experiences and some of them do resemble the symptoms of delusional thinking- I imagine that's why people say your reasoning sounds irrational. Sorry- I don't mean to offend you. I'm not qualified to say either.

Still- the most concerning part of your posts for me is perhaps trying to rationalise hurting other people because you think that will protect your family. I imagine mostly people here will struggle with that and they will likely question the thought process that leads you to that conclusion.",,,,,,,,
,2591268,Ash,"Jul 10, 2024 at 12:59 AM","I don't know much about the ""sound mind"" definition in UK medical, psychological or legal terms but I do know that when I'm experiencing intense PTSD symptoms, I lose the ability to differentiate between what's real and what's happening now and what's a memory. One of my triggers is the sound of a motorbike, especially one speeding. So if I hear one and I can't manage the trigger and see a man or group of young men, especially if he/they are being bolshy or cocky, I might simultaneously see them on the other side of the street and believe that he/they are violently and sexually attacking me, to the point that I can hear it and feel it. Now, I'm ""fortunate"" in that my most common trauma responses are to freeze or fawn but I have been known to go on the attack. Were that to happen, and for example I ""defended"" myself against a man who happened to be walking too close at the wrong time when a motorbike went past too fast and also too close and things got screwed up in my head, I'd have to hope my Legal Aid defense lawyer knew more than me about the whole thing as I'd be fucked.

That's just one example of a rational decision (self defense against an attacker) versus irrational (the attacks actually happened years ago but recent events triggered them and now full on flashbacks mean I lose the ability to differentiate between past attacks and a hypothetical man innocently walking down the street not actually attacking me).

Does that help at all?",,,,,,,,
,2591324,rozeske,"Jul 10, 2024 at 2:39 AM","I generally tend to steer clear of judging people's reasons for ctb and labeling them as rational or irrational. The fact is whatever reason is given by the person or insinuated by others, it is usually only the surface level of what that person actually went through. You know, like it is the very tip of the iceberg. Someone could go through so many years of troubles that accumulate over time until some event happens to push them over the edge or make them say fuck it. Looking at that one last event might be tempting to say oh that is a silly thing to kill yourself over. But there might be a shit ton of things going on below the seeming silly situation. The fact is no one really knows what's been going on a persons life and a persons head. Only that person knows fully how rational their decision is or how long they have thought of it.

We all have moments of rushed actions we would regrate once we've calmed down. Actions that may end up putting us in danger. Sometimes a situation may seem like rushed or impulsive and I'm only human and i will of course point that out but also gently remind myself that that person didn't randomly open page 300 of their life's metaphoric book and that they have lived through each and every page of it, if that makes sense . So I trust that they can decide if and when their life is worth living. If this decision feels rational enough for them.

There is an exception that make me stop in my track though. That is when someone feels like they have to kill themselves outside of their will. When someone is cornered or pressured by others to kill themselves. When someone comes to this decision and take their life to fulfill other's wishes. I believe we all have the right to make decision over our lives but it should only be about us and our lifes. When others play a role, that is when it stops being a choice. That is when it crosses the line for me.",,,,,,,,

Definitely irrational is when someone thinks only their death can rescue others and this by involving innocents (I know some of your past post history that sounded very like psychotic episodes - but that's not the topic here). With a suicide we cannot save someone else bc suicide always is and can only be a personal decision that should not make use of others to achieve it. That is clearly irrational.",,,,,,,,
,2591424,timetodie24,"Jul 10, 2024 at 5:15 AM","Thank you everyone for your view, it is really interesting to hear different perspectives.
Everyone raises good points and I agree - only the individual knows what's 'rational' to them and something seeming irrational to others shouldn't deny them of their right to die. I guess many people outside of here would try tell you most or if not all suicide is irrational. What matters I think is that the individual understand the consequences of their decision, has considered their other options (even if chooses not to try them) and knows that they can back out if they wish.

I don't necessarily believe impulsive = irrational. I would always discourage impulsive attempts as such a final decision shouldn't be rushed and also increases change of something going wrong . But I do think you can have impulsive attempt for rational reasons. I guess impulsive means more likely to be using emotion > logic . But we all reason with emotion to some extent and that shouldn't be barrier.

As others have said there would be exceptions such as only doing it because of something like drugs or delusions but they don't want to die snd when thinking clearly they wouldn't do it. I couldn't and wouldn't stop someone but would want to help them consider all options to make informed choice.",,,,,,,,
,2591436,pthnrdnojvsc,"Jul 10, 2024 at 5:42 AM","to me it's irrational to want to be a consciousness that grew in a 3 pound brain that can suffer unending constant unbearable pain

to be trapped in an animal body that has so many constant needs of thirst, hunger , sleep , and more.

I throw away bags of food and food packaging every day. probably eat tons of food per year enough to fill a building. all the work groceries a job to get and prepare and eat this food . then clean everything dishes trash etc after gorging like a pig . 100,000 years ago i'd have to kill and accidentally torture how many animals to death to eat 3 times a day ? back then it wasn't easier you had to walk miles every day on bare feet find a rock and bash an animal's head to death so you could eat so that's what i mean by accidentally torturing an animal to death. all this cause i'm hungry as fuck all the time . all this for no purpose no reason. i don't get it how everyone sees this as ok.

to have to work constantly to fullfill those needs , solve problems , chores , work a job etc

to be a fragile small animal under constant threats of excruciating pain, accidents, diseases, old age, kidnapping, ettreme torture, parasites

to be a slave to a mind to not be bored for example, to have unfullfilled needs and bad memories . a mind full of fears of difficult problems, uncertaintity, threats and risks, to live in a state of fear of all the risks and dangers of evil life and an oppressive evil world.

to be a decaying mass of 30 trillion cells that are prone to cancer, that will age and die anyway ( to me Death is best thing but to most they fear Death)

To be a host to 30 trillion other parasites bacteria and monstrous microorganisms in addiction to the 30 trillion human eukaryotic cells each one the same as in a fly , mouse . a neuron in fly mouse human is exactly the same a neuron is a nerve cell is a brain cell is a neuron in any species. of course all this is hidden and then a human is portrayed as some kind of ethereal god like being instead of the small aging fragile primate , just that first cell, just a zygote a sperm",,,,,,,,
,2591440,mythofsisyphus,"Jul 10, 2024 at 5:53 AM","I think it's a really tough question. Completely agree that it can't be judged from an outside perspective - that one's suffering is individual to them and what we see on the surface cannot be used to gauge someone's experience or pain.

But at the same time, I do think our pain can cloud our judgement. There's been previous times in life where I thought my world was over, where the pain felt unbearable. Where I made decisions based on that pain that felt totally rational and justified. But now looking back, the pain did pass, I'm glad I didn't do extreme things and I can see that my thoughts/decisions weren't rational.

This is not to dismiss the validity of our pain, but as best as possible to ensure we view it from wider lens. What are the chances things could change or improve? Although it feels like there's no hope, from a more objective viewpoint are there things that I could at least try before making a final decision, be that giving it more time to see how things pan out, seeking support etc.

I also think we can easily get caught up in irrational lines of thinking to justify our actions. For example, dismissing or minimising the impact our death could have on our loved ones, if we're lucky enough to have them. Pain and suffering can so easily distort our perspective - ""they'll move on over time"", ""they'll be better off without me"" etc. etc. But sadly I don't think these things are rational - there's so much evidence attesting to the long-lasting devastation suicide can cause.

I think if we can say, with our whole hearts, that we've assessed our options and it truly feels it's unlikely there's much we can to do improve things and the pain is so intense that we can face the repercussions of our actions fully without deceiving ourselves, but nonetheless still feel we need to end things, then I don't see any irrationality in this.",,,,,,,,

Impulsive is basically 'I've always been happy but suffered one adverse event like a breakup and have not fully thought things through.' while not common on this site, a large portion of actual attempts fall into this category, which I discourage and would consider irrational.

For non -impulsive attempts, the thinking is basically this:

1. My life is more bad than good or otherwise not worth living by my personal evaluation (from a quality standpoint).
2. I see no viable path to that changing, or have at least heavily weighed the odds and find suicide to be my personal best decision.

Something along those lines, right? Our clarity on predicting the future is limited by our experiences and what we learn from others. Generally, it is my thought that if you have a major change at your disposal which you've never experienced - eg, leaving home/school and having independence for the first time - you should probably dip your toe in before deciding, but I couldn't call it strictly irrational to ignore that advice.

So, of non-impulsive suicides, what would be irrational?
Ctb when you personally don't believe it's the best choice for your happiness/contentedness. [Minus, I suppose, criminals who ctb because they can't control their impulses and want to protect others. I guess better wording is if you don't think your ctb will benefit anyone in a way you can actually justify]
Ctb when you know your circumstances could change in a way with a high chance to change your evaluation of your life.
Related, but ctb due to irrational fear. Look, feelings are valid, but not always rational. My fear of bees is not rational. If I ctb because there's a hornets nest on my porch that is not rational. If you are afraid of change, people, independence, etc. and ctb rather than trying it could be considered irrational, even if valid.
CTB for something beyond logic: 'my religion/beliefs demand I do', 'my ctb is a form of rebellion against the machine!' (no it isn't - this could be called the ""13 reasons why fallacy"". Also, once your dead it doesn't matter), 'humans are evil so rather than trying to fix things I must just ctb even though I'm happy!'

Just some thoughts.",,,,,,,,
,2596120,Edpal247,"Jul 14, 2024 at 1:26 PM","My rationality and that of other will always be at odd - they are not me. I can live or I can ctb with that, Family and frineds, and suicide help lines will ALWAYS tell you it is not rational. That's their job and place in your circle, however small that is.",,,,,,,,

Fiz uma pesquisa rápida no próprio google utilizando o termo "" suicídio nitrito de sódio"" e logo na primeira página encontrei dois relatórios de caso (LINK RELATÓRIO DF,LINK RELATORIO CAMPINAS) um em Campinas e outro no DF, e cada relatório detalhava 4 casos diferentes, todos acompanhados de fotos, algumas do próprio cadáver e outras dos fracos dos medicamentos encontrados no local. Confesso que a cor azulada que o corpo adiquire após a execução desse método me deixou um pouco aterrorizado. Outro ponto interessante é que pelo visto a maioria dos casos parecem ter sido de usuários desse fórum, sendo que uma das mulheres que cometeu CTB estava logada em sua conta do SS segundo a perícia, além do mais os demais medicamentos presentes no local são aqueles indicados pelos principais guias do método SN presentes no fórum, uma tradução do método acompanhado por uma tabela bem resumida foi postada por um dos usuários brasileiros mais ativos e prestativos da comunidade, que também tirou sua vida empregando esse método.

Pretendo realizar a travessia para o outro lado em um quarto de hotel, evitando que minha família me encontre antes do fim do processo ou que vejam meu cadáver azulado, que pelas fotos presentes nos relatórios, é algo bem grotesco.

Uma duvida que tenho é se consigo por meio de uma carta, e disponibilizando os fundos de minha conta bancária, pedir para as autoridades cremarem meu corpo e entregar apenas as cinzas para minha família. Não quero velório ou ser enterrado, acho que só tornaria a situação mais traumática para eles. Um outro sonho meu seria utilizar minhas cinzas como adubo de alguma planta, seria como se você pudesse ser útil para algum ser vivo após sua morte, e de certa forma viver através dele.

i'm over eighteen and still in fucking high school because i failed a year once due to health being awful and constant moving made the system try push me back cause of different curriculums. my grades have always sucked because i never fully understood the language i was learning in and this year i changed curriculums and i'm learning in english now, which was supposed to be good cause i'm fluent in it. no matter how fucking good i think i'm doing on tests or assignments my grades still end up being either the BARE MINIMUM to pass or a straight up fail. i'm so fucking exhausted

this on top of everything i'm enduring this past year is enough to make me wanna die even more. i know i said in the last post i had things i wanted to wait out on but it doesnt even matter anymore. i'm gonna end up a high school dropout no matter how hard i try and i'm gonna keep living my days in fear of my fucking sa'er being in this house.

,2595910,bFre3,"Jul 14, 2024 at 9:18 AM","I'm not entirely sure if this is the right thing to say, I'll be careful with my words.

I'm a bit hypocritical for saying this, since I'm going through somewhat similar things. But, if this is something you've decided only within a few weeks or so, then please do wait it out. CTB from impulse is not good.

The despair from trying and things not working out are real. I personally believe it's entirely acceptable to just... give up as well. That's a valid option in my book, and it drives me nuts whenever people tell me 'things will get better soon'. What I'm trying to emphasise is that your reasons are valid (I don't think there are any reasons out there that are not valid), but your conclusion from it might be a bit hasty, at least from what you've written.

I'd personally say to think about it a bit more, and ensure it's a choice you're content with, not a blind desire.

Of course, this is just some words coming from an internet stranger. In the end, you should do what you think is right for you.

I wish i just could do partial like so many and just pass. But i guess that's everyones problem here.. overthinking doubting and researching

Full suspension is so fck'd and traumatizing to be found like that. The person hanging looks way worse too instead when going partial i believe. Partial is not that bad looking at all imo.

In the case of hanging I was thinking of maybe consuming a lethal cocktail of medicine. The cocktail should kill fast. I do not take into account pain as I should be unconscious if the hanging failed. This way if the hanging fails, the medicine takes care of you.

I am currently looking for AE for SN but did not find a source yet. If I can't find any I considered some more extreme options:

Long drop hanging is fast and painless but it is quite gruesome. It can also decapitate you.

Electric shock can be fast and painless if you know what you are doing.

Seriously. I would like to read about it.
Because there is brain damage, because of which a person cannot speak, thinks very poorly, and learns to move again. In general, he returns to the age of a baby.

And there is a disability, after which the body is immobilized, but consciousness is preserved. The brain thinks well and is still able to transmit pain signals, despite the fact that a person can no longer move his body at all.",2566349,,,,,,,

Because you're correct in what you said (your second paragraph describes the locked-in syndrome) , but a severely brain injured person will, if they survive the initial incident, start off in a coma, and if they survive that, possibly go into a vegetative state, and if they survive THAT, *maybe* move on into minimally conscious state and then into full consciousness.

But the thing is is that many people who are that severely brain injured either die or remain stuck at one stage before they die after a few years at most. So what I'm saying is that it's possible for you to be aware, conscious, and suffering after something like a hanging, but there are a whole lotta hurdles you gotta jump first and that most people die before then, ether naturally or through life support being removed.

When looking at rankings of the most successful suicide methods (95% and above in lethality) the vast majority are usually violent, with the exception of cyanide poisoning.

Also, I don't get the point I mentioned the brain not being able to live without oxygen. The point I'm making is that claiming that killing yourself is easy and that people only struggle due to mental/emotional barriers is dumb when you literally have to fight against your own biology to die. Even with the methods you mentioned, depending on their execution, there is a chance that you'll just end up giving yourself severe brain damage instead of actually succeeding.

Once you do give birth to someone, assuming you aren't a super rich individual (else I doubt you'd even be on SS), they are guaranteed to be slaves unless if they die before their first job (i.e. at a super young age).
sigh, this is a common belief that most normies have in life which is absolutely delusional. The only way to be at the top is via generational wealth. Society and the elites have somehow managed to convince everybody that the normies can be at the top if they try hard enough. Yet that isn't true. Most of us will have to slave away from adulthood (or even before adulthood) to death/retirement age.

The best way to deal with the system is to not participate in it to begin with. There are two ways for those who are alive to not participate in the system. The two ways are to be a neet or to be dead. The former isn't possible for everybody due to financial issues and the latter is extremely difficult to do since euthanasia isn't wildly available. Therefore, it'd be better to prevent somebody from being alive as they wouldn't have to deal with this at all. Prevention (i.e. not giving birth to a kid) is better than cure (i.e. the aforementioned two ways to not participate in the system)

Without it, one would have a hard time keeping the hood on and it would let the gas flow out very quickly. Most cylinders with compressed gas are made to have a regulator attached to them. I'm not sure if the balloon tanks in the brochure do or not....it might be specialized for filling balloons.

Helium cylinders typically use the same sort of regulator as any other inert gas (nitrogen, argon, etc).
PPH shows that In the UK, it appears that the 'BS341-No3' is the connection type. (See page 133/134 in the PPH 2023 edition for the setup & parts)

It's so easy that even in medical settings there always has to be narcan nearby when a patient is receiving opiates just in case they OD on accident. Everyone's tolerance is different. Finding pure opioids is the big problem. Anything you buy off the streets has a very high chance of being impure. Benzos aren't as easy as opiates, but still can and do kill people very frequently, either accident or suicide, as they are a central nervous system depressant and thus can stop you from breathing. Again, everyone's tolerance is different and it's also hard to find enough pure benzos under the table.
There is no such thing as a 100% peaceful and reliable method. Every method will have some people say it was painful or highly unpleasant. It doesn't matter what method you look at, there will be stories of pain and panic. Pain and peace and subjective.",2535893,,,,,,,

My mom always tells me to finish my vegetables when I come up from the basement but I just tell her that she is a normie wageslave that would eat shit tasting food just to prolong her meaningless lifespan. Upon thinking on the matter for an extended period of time, I have concluded that the most optimal diet consists of drinking monster energy for breakfast, lunch and supper, along with burger king double whopper for breakfast, mcdonalds mcfeast for lunch, and to top it all off with something really delightful before bedtime, I do a shot of fent before I go to sleep.

Living this way makes me feel so good and comfortable, and I don't mind if it kills me earlier because I wanna die anyway - no point living just to get a job to serve some mega corporation or starting a family that will just condemn my children to the same fate as me

The fact that I feel so good living this way just goes to show that the body was designed to want to die. So many good things are bad for your health. Alcohol, drugs, delicious food, unprotected sex, masturbating 5 times a day....

The whole thing is a bit more complex if you think of it from an evolutionary POV.

Fastfood isn't healthy but it contains fat and other nutrients that are important to build up storage (=we become fat) for times when we find less food to survive. Nowadays there are no food shortages and we don't have to do anything to get food, we don't burn any calories anymore but stuff a lot into us and we may become overweight.

It's a shame our bodies are so clueless when we live somewhere where food is abundant or very processed. I wish I could tell my body to just get rid of all the crap rather than storing it as fat.

Also, humans tend to eat a lot of unhealthy foods because unhealthy foods contain a lot things like sugar, fats, and large amounts of calories, which we naturally crave. Our man-made world has evolved faster than our bodies are able to keep up with. Traits that would have aided in our survival in the past, such as our cravings and love for foods that are high in sugar, such as fruits, now are detrimental to us as sugary high-calorie foods have become more abundant and are higher in calories than what exists in nature. In the past, these craving would likely have helped us since sugary and fatty foods were hard to come by in the past and would have provided us what a lot of energy. Now, large fast-food chains go out of their way to specifically use things, like lots of sugars and fats, in their foods to make them addictive.

,2590210,Scattered-Soul,"Jul 9, 2024 at 1:02 AM","It feels a bit silly to do something akin to an update post since I'm just a nobody and it's not like I posted much even when I was active but I just need to vent, to put this out there somewhere.

The main reason I ended up here was because of psych drug-induced damage and progressive neurocognitive disorder, it's a long story and more than half of my posts here were about that. I was worsening and I wanted to ensure that I had a way out before I completely lost the ability (both physical and mental) to create and execute a plan. I had multiple (pretty torturous) unsuccessful hanging attempts that solidified that that method simply wouldn't work for me so I moved on to SN instead. Reading through the protocol and comprehending it, let alone purchasing it, was pretty challenging but I somehow did it.

I officially got my SN at the beginning of January and I felt like I'd CTB soon right after but at the same time since it made me feel secure that I had a way out at any given moment, I didn't want to go without having tried something to see if it'd make a change for my condition. It's irreversible but I still wanted to see if something, anything, could give me even 5% improvement for a single day and in my head I thought that I should live for as long as possible despite rapidly worsening, that some level of existence was still better than nothing since I didn't want to (and still don't wanna) die.

I also wanted to test the SN to ensure that it was pure and to get the rest of the stuff like antiemetics, and a scale. But I procrastinated because of my debilitating fatigue, my lack of financial savings since I spent everything on the SN and because I didn't want anything to ""expire"" in case I took too long to go through with it. Now I'm screwed though, I don't have neither the money nor the function to get anything else, to test the SN, to potentially get new SN if this one were not to be pure (or not be SN at all, I hate that I couldn't even do the blood taste since I'm just incompetent and couldn't get blood out of myself). My source seemed reliable since it was just some guy selling chemicals and vitamins but you never know and it's also been 6 months, I've kept my SN in their original plastic bottles in plastic bags but it's still possible to have oxidized.

That aside, I got damaged again

I've still been worsening over the past 6 months, the main reasons I've managed to persevere were because I decided to give the ""try anything to make an impact on your condition"" route a try before CTB, previously I tried meds for dementia with no effect and then the next route was my psychiatrist prescribing me Concerta which didn't do anything either but I was holding onto the hope of her upping the dosage. That took months but I tried my best to be patient and survive. It helped that my hostile home situation improved a lot, it didn't stop my condition from progressing but it kept me saner and stress-free, I also miraculously managed to make numerous friends online while waiting for the months to pass. In my attempt to just pass time and live a little longer by trying to make a positive impact on other people's lives, I became attached to them, I became attached to the work we did together (trying to be vague) and I wanted to finish my duties in relation to that before I were to CTB.

What I didn't anticipate was becoming so much worse from a medication, again. After months of waiting, the Concerta didn't do anything, my psychiatrist refused to up the dosage more than she already had and she switched me to Modafinil as her (and mine) last alternative. It's used for narcolepsy, excessive daytime sleepiness, ADHD, cognitive impairment even in dementia patients and I'm all of those. I didn't expect it to work since after my injury no stimulant has affected me and the bad side effects are more along the lines of high anxiety, depression, paranoia etc I was concerned for those. I didn't get any of the conventional side effects, instead I got hit with even worse fatigue, worse feeling of drunkness and worse cognition which was subtle at first but then sped up. Apparently some people greatly benefit from it and others paradoxical effects like that instead, I even saw some people saying that they felt lobotomized while taking it which is exactly how I feel. Only that for others it resolved after stopping but for me, since my organism is an anomaly, it has continued getting worse even after cessation. And I know that no doctor can help me, I can only get worse.

Because of that, I feel like it's my time to go

This post, while long, doesn't cover even a speck of the symptoms I deal with but the way I'd describe it especially after the recent worsening is that I'm stuck between life and death. My level of consciousness has been decreased severely, I feel like my brain might turn off any second now, my whole body is hard to move and I feel like it'll paralyze on its own, I feel like I need to sleep but the thing is that I know my brain won't just die and sleeping doesn't fix it, sooner or later I wake up and I need to get up and just move around aimlessly while feeling like a total corpse just to get some brain activity going on just so I can type something like this. But it's so hard and torturous, there aren't words to describe it. Feeling like you're 80% dead especially in your head and like you're about to black out but still being alive and aware of that, wanting to be able to do things, wanting to just get your brain to wake up and think and to get over that blocked feeling but being completely unable to do so and being aware that you'll most likely lose your abilities completely soon is torturous and terrifying.

Sadly the human brain can suffer a lot and take a lot of damage, you can quite literally be gone as a person, stuck in a vegetative state and your body would still breathe, still exist and you can be stuck like that for years or decades, being at the mercy of others. You can end up in that state because of medical intervention and no one would be sued for that and no doctor would come to save you. I don't want that and no one else around me would be able to release me from my pain since it's a crime. So I know I have to do it myself and I have to do it while having some consciousness left, I feel like my personality, my soul, me as a person is gone but there's visibly still some level of self awareness and I'd like to go while I still have that.

It's so fucking hard to accept and go through with though

When I got my SN I told myself that before death, I'll give a try to anything that could impact my condition just in case a miracle happens. And if that I were to get worse, all I needed to remember was just to drink that SN and I would just CTB. Well, I'm here now... but it's just so hard to go through. When you don't have a solid method that you know will guarantee your death, you feel this sense of urgency and panic, it's easier to attempt, at least that's been my experience. But when you have something that you feel like is going to end it all for sure, almost as if it's a button that will kill you instantly, it's hard to let go. Because you know once it's done, it's done, it's over and that was it so you cling onto life for a little while longer.

It's also a challenge to be able to suppress and beat your survival instinct for the entire duration of following the SN protocol. Pressing a button (or a trigger) would be way easier to do in a moment when you feel extra suicidal and just want to escape immediately. But if you're someone like me who doesn't want to let go of life, 12 hours (for example) are a lot of time to go ""I wish I could live for one more day"", to want to eat your favorite food again and be unable to resist, to feel fear. I admire everyone who's been able to go through with it just because I know that it takes a lot of strength and resistance.

For me, when it comes to my own life, CTB feels like a tragedy. Ironically enough, I used to be really depressed and miserable throughout my entire life pre-psych drug injury which was 17 years (and this was years ago, I'm an adult now, don't ban me lol). I felt this deep indescribable level of loneliness, I was bullied a lot by my peers, I got sexually assaulted by them and even almost murdered just on the basis that they found me ""weird"" and offputting, they'd tell me that they just had the urge to hurt me but didn't understand why (later on I learned that I'm autistic and they probably got the uncanny valley feeling). I was abused at home and lived in a hostile and very stressful home environment for pretty much my entire life, my relatives treated me like shit too, I grew up having a pretty severe case of OCD and new issues would just pile up as I grew up which is what led me to a psychiatrist's office where I feel like I met my true end. It was only after I acquired the rare and unlucky psych drug induced damage and progressive disease that those other factors got better, like graduating school and not having to deal with that anymore, my home situation getting better, finding amazing friends I could be myself with. And I guess the memory loss also helped with the bad memories, I don't feel that depression and suicidality anymore.

So now I want to live but I can't, I wish I could go back to the past, before the psych drug injury, I wish I could tell my old self all the coping mechanisms that could've helped me, that it could get better and that nothing from the past could've compared to the suffering of living with this progressive damage. I wish I could wake up and for all of this to have been just a nightmare and to have my emotions, intelligence, soul and life back. I wish I could've lived, learned skills like drawing, singing, playing an instrument, roller skating (I actually got a pair while waiting for the SN to arrive but I could never get better with them because of my balance issues and weak muscles), I wanted to be able to learn, I've always loved obtaining knowledge and I loved philosophy, I wanted to help people as well and maybe make a positive change for the world or even just individual people.

There are so many movies I haven't watched, things I haven't learned, video games I haven't gotten into, music I haven't listened to and food I haven't tried, I haven't really had much life experiences either like I've never gone bowling, I've barely travelled even in my country. I don't want to leave my mother who loves me dearly and has sacrificed so much for me, my cat, my friends who also love me deeply (even though I'm sure they'll be fine way more quickly), the world and existence in general. I selfishly feel sad that life will just continue on as it always has even when I'm gone, all the people I know will just continue existing like that, without me.

My best friend's grandma passed away recently and I went to the funeral, seeing her get buried and the graveyard in general filled me with dread, it's irrational because I'll literally be dead, nonexistent, but I got a sense of such profound sadness that I'd just be left there, all alone. I don't want to leave my room and things behind, I don't want to be forgotten or replaced, I'm scared of who's going to take care of my mother afterwards, I wish I could grow old and healthy with my friends, I wish to see what would happen to the world in general. It feels painful that this has been my only chance to exist.

What provides me comfort is the fact that everyone dies sooner or later, so none of this really matters in the grand scheme of things. It's just so damn hard to get over those feelings, that fear and clinging onto life even when you're losing yourself and are suffering. Also the only way I can accept death is by rationalizing it but that requires me to be able to think which is very hard nowadays, being stuck in this between life and death state with reduced level of consciousness as if I'm about to disappear any second now has also given me a glimpse of what true death and nothingness feels like and that has just made me feel even more scared of it.

This is all, thank you for acknowledging me for anyone who read the entire thing. The writing skills here are not a true representation of my current brain capacity and capabilities, I simply refuse to post gibberish and this alone took me 2 days without me doing anything else. I can only hope to be brave enough when the time comes in... no idea how much time and that I won't be stuck suffering. First step is to try to test my SN with my current limitations.",,,,,,,,
,2590350,mythofsisyphus,"Jul 9, 2024 at 5:51 AM","I've read your entire post, and honestly it sounds like something I could have written to a tee, I relate to pretty much every single thing you have said. I'm so, so sorry that you are experiencing this. I'm also experiencing medication induced injury that is likely permanent and understand so much of what you describe - feeling like your soul and emotions have been brutally ripped out. Not recognising your own mind and relationship to the people you love and world around you. It's an indescribable form of torcher that I don't think anyone can even begin to comprehend unless they have gone through it.

I also relate so much to your conflicted feelings around ending things. Desperately not wanting to die, knowing I loved life and wanted to experience so much - my career, love, travel, good food, movies, wine, music, video games - the list is endless. Whilst the thought of suicide is at times immensely freeing, as you said once it's it's done. Yes, the suffering will be gone, but so will all my dreams, hopes and aspirations. Any possibility for goodness will be gone - I won't be able to hear birds sing, pet my dog, or speak with my family. It's a final, irreversible decision. I also feel sad that life would just continue without me - that I wouldn't get to grow old and experience life like everyone else, which I so desperately want to do. The thought of all of this is crushing.

But facing my daily life is equally crushing. Because in many ways I'm not getting to experience these things anyway, I feel like an observer to life. Everyone around me is moving forward, doing the things they want, but no matter what I do I am trapped in my mind, unable to experience joy, love, happiness. Unable to think clearly, or make sense of my muted feelings and distant convoluted thoughts. It's almost as if time has frozen and I'm watching my life, and everything I'd hoped for, fall apart, and I'm powerless to do anything about it. No matter where I am, no matter what I do, my mind is broken.

The grief of what life should have been vs. what it currently is in indescribable. I feel jealous and angry that other people can continue their life. It's destroyed my empathy for more minor life struggles. It's turned me into someone I barely recognise, someone I don't like. The regret over ever going on medication, knowing that what I was going through in the first place was completely insignificant in comparison to where I now find myself to be, plagues my mind. The things I could be doing, the life I could be living, if I had not made this decision.

Not being able to think clearly also makes making any decision so much harder. I'm terrified of doing something that the 'real' me would not want - is it just the damage causing me to think this way? What do I actually think? Loosing your sense of self and ability to trust your thoughts and feelings is terrifying. In one moment, I can feel certain I need to end things. But the next I feel a sense of injustice - I won't let this destroy me completely. I'll fight for my life and anything that I'm still capable of extracting from it. But then I try to watch TV, I try to talk to people, I try to do some work... and the reality of the nature of my numbed, foggy and bewildering mind slaps me in the face, and I once again begin to question if this is something I can endure.

I wish there were some words of advice I could give you, but I do want you to know that you're not alone. I understand how isolating this experience can be, but if it means anything at all, it sounds like we're going through pretty much exactly the same thing - I'm with you.

Obviously I don't know your full situation, but the one thing I'm reminding myself is there's no rush to make any decision. Whilst life might be horrendous and full of suffering and grief, at least I still have the option to make a decision one way or another whilst I'm still alive. If I rush into ending things, I won't have this privilege. But at the same time, I question how long I should continue thinking like this - at some point is enough enough? I'm afraid I haven't figured that out yet.

Why don't we both try to have some time where we just try not to think about it all. Where we just embrace the horrible, numbed, confusing fogginess exactly for what it is and do what we can to make the most of our day. Maybe we can't endure the rest of our lives like this, I don't know. But I think we both deserve at least a day, an hour or even a minute, free from trying to work out what we do next. The decisions we need to make aren't going anywhere. Please know that you're in my thoughts, and you're not alone.",,,,,,,,

What I've examined during my stay and heard universally is:
-You usually get prescribed a psych med during your stay
-There is little privacy
-Lots of eyes on you
-There will probably be other patients much crazier than you

,2543341,dragonofenvy,"May 31, 2024 at 3:50 PM","@nightlygem has a pretty good universal guideline of what it's like that's not as long-winded as my experience. I can go into further detail but I have a problem of writing for ages so I'm trying to keep it short.

I went to one when I was a lot younger, and I feel like because I went to one for minors I was treated a lot better than one for adults. When I was in the ER about to go I overheard a nurse outside my door saying ""They can't just come to the hospital like this just because they're depressed."" Now bear in mind this is an ER nurse but I think I can use her as an example of people not necessarily being caring and understanding.

It was alright overall, but not something I'd want to go back to. They're just there to make your suicidal ""impulse"" go away after a few days (I was there for a month). The other patients there were all people you'd never think were suicidal. They were perfectly normal, friendly, and pretty cool, though it was a little awkward for me to be one of two males while the others at the time were women. I also was 17 at the time, and the next youngest was 14. So that was a little awkward too, but they put all teenagers in the same place.

There was one girl who was very withdrawn and wouldn't speak much, but there wasn't anything like how it's portrayed in media as a place where everyone is crazy clawing at the walls and screaming. Some places are actually like that though from what I've heard. For me everyone seemed like normal kids. Sometimes there'd be an angry tantrum but it was never more than a fist on a table and raised voice. We pretty much were able to control and police ourselves, but it helps when the group is only a half-dozen to ten patients. The other patients I was with were 10/10. They were great people who lived terrible lives.

I got prescribed medication about a week in since I couldn't sleep and was having PTSD episodes. It helped with the sleep. I just took it without question, and they never made sure I did either. They just gave the pill bottle.

You were always accompanied by an adult no matter where you went and had to follow a schedule which would change each day. Ie: Mondays would be art at 10am and Tuesdays would be yoga at 10am for an example. Regarding the art and yoga stuff, they tried to teach us ""coping strategies"" with the idea that if we use the coping strategies we won't kill ourselves. Yeah, it isn't effective. I even asked one of the staffers and they said that they have a 20% success rate with patients feeling better 1 month after they leave.

Some staff members were happy cheerful and energetic, while others were a little more distant and indifferent. Sometimes it depended on the day. There was also only one doctor whom I'd talk to for about 5 minutes every other day. He gave me the prescription. I guess he's just so good that he only needs 5 minutes to know what you need /s.

I'm lucky that I went to a small one that was heavily segregated by age brackets. It was only for minors except for the drug-addict ward so that probably helped. Though I got really depressed near the end when they lifted the segregation to do a little event and I saw kids as young as 5 years old telling me the horrible things their mothers and/or fathers did to them. They really shouldn't have done that. The temporary lift of the segregation was positive in other ways though since some of the young kids were cool to be around, but I still wish they hadn't done their ""fun event"". They're gonna make mistakes, but it still troubles me knowing that my psych ward experience is probably one of the best ones out there that I've seen.",,,,,,,,

They won't allow you basic grooming items like deodorant or mouthwash or things like that. They may give you their crappy versions of these things that contain no alcohol or what they deem harmful ingredients. You can't properly shower. And you're of course locked in.

,2543372,ferrie,"May 31, 2024 at 4:17 PM","Your experience in a psych ward will vary WIDELY even between hospitals in the same city. In my experience, the richer the hospital the better your stay. I was in two different wards within a month, and my experiences at each was crazily different. The first psych ward was a very nice hospital in one of the most affluent cities in my state. Visual checks were done every 15 minutes, but staff would knock before entering your room, you chose your own meals every day, showers were in separate bathrooms with locks, you had a lot of say in whether you were put on meds & what type, and you met with a psychiatrist, a social worker, and an occupational therapist daily. The second psych ward was in my childhood hometown in a very poor area, and I witnessed and experienced multiple literal human rights violations while I was there on top of patients having forcible injections, patients physically attacking each other, and having my belongings stolen. Whether you're forced to take meds or not really depends on how the facility is run, but if you are prescribed them, you will be released faster if you are taking them. I would also recommend never going to a psych ward that isn't also connected to a medical hospital, those are usually the nicer wards where staff actually works with you",,,,,,,,
,2543565,Onelegman,"May 31, 2024 at 7:17 PM","I am in Spain and I was only in the psychiatric ward once for 13 days if I remember correctly. What is said may or may not be very similar to what happens in the USA.

It was in a fairly new hospital and there were no walls except in the rooms and the bathroom, everything was diaphanous, so that the nurses and orderlies could see where you were. There were several tables in front of the room where they were and chairs, all made of semi-hard plastic. I go with crutches, they took them away from me for fear that I or someone would use them as a weapon and they gave me a walker, something strange because it was something much more forceful.

There was breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner, an hour of group therapy in the mornings, where normally some activity was done with clay, painting, filling out forms, a circle for each person to talk, very similar to AA.

You had to take the pills no matter what, otherwise they would take you to your room and lecture you. I have always been docile with medication and I know it is for my own good, but there were cases. If they continued with that plan, they tied him up and injected him. I had a very nice classmate who was anorexic and had a feeding tube, she forced herself to eat and the nurses never did, but on 2 occasions she tore out the tube, what courage!

There was also an almost teenager who chose to go there instead of the police station after taking drugs and accidentally hurting his grandmother. 3 suicides, including me, the other 2 were women, one of them took pills, very young, the other was a mature nursing home director, she stabbed herself with a large kitchen knife 3 times in her heart, brutal.

There are no mirrors, but sheets of some reflective material, covered in plastic, you cannot sleep with the door closed and you cannot use the bathroom in your room, you must go out to the common bathroom in the common room. If you have to cut your nails, it must be supervised by the nurse.

The staff looks at you with distrust, even if you are a suicidal person who wants to harm yourself, you cannot get too close or they start to look at you as if you were a paranoid schizophrenic with the intention of harming them. Little kindness. Once a week the psychologist or psychiatrist sees you, he does not seek to help you, just medicate you until he notices that you are no longer you and he can kick you out of there with a medical discharge. On a previous occasion when I tried to admit myself, the ward was full, they gave me anafranil (antidepressant) under my tongue and sent me home. A poor woman who talked a lot (a lot of dissociation) and walked non-stop was tied to a wheelchair with a straitjacket included, she got her period and they didn't want to change her clothes, give her a compress or even clean her.

You can choose the food from 3 options but it is quite disgusting. After dinner they let you watch TV for half an hour, everyone in a tiny, hot room, no one chooses the channel, it's just news or tabloids, almost no one pays attention and they talk to each other.

I got them to let me bring a book but they only let me take it for one hour in the afternoon. Luckily you could ask them to print drawings for you and color them with crayons. My salvation if I'm honest. In the morning they let you call a family member for 5 minutes and in the afternoons a single person from your family could visit you for an hour, not many were that lucky. And always an armed guard watched the entry and exit of those people. Almost at the end of my stay I was able to go out at that time to the hospital cafeteria and take the opportunity to smoke like crazy.

As soon as one left, another patient came in, sometimes it was immediate, people who had real problems were expelled to put in a criminal who chose to stay there rather than the police station, something that didn't seem fair to me. When I left the atmosphere was almost like a prison, except for 3 or 4 people that you already knew and who for whatever reason were not discharged, the rest, about 15, were people who had chosen to stay there for a while, the majority were not. They suffered from some illness, a judge visited them to give them the court's report and only 2 or 3 were taken to provisional prison.

Not to dwell any longer, it was a horrible experience, every time a psychologist or family member suggests admitting me again, it all comes at once and makes me nauseous. Not only because of previous experience, but also because of knowing how badly they treat anyone who is there, regardless of their illness.

Any privacy is stripped from you, I felt suffocated in my own room. Nurses would do hourly checkups, even of a night (they would flash red torches at me) so any desire for solitude was quickly forgotten. I had to go to school there too which was such a drag.

I did attempt there, it was a spare of the moment thing and not thought out (I tried to suffocate myself) and was restrained (basically choked) and put under heavy observation for about a week which made everything worse. The food was so bad that I starved and was forced into eating to avoid getting put on a drip.

Not to mention the other patients!!!! I am in no room to judge because I too am mentally fucked but there was an older boy there who was about eighteen that basically groomed me. This relationship was practically ignored by the nurses when I asked for help 'He's just being himself, he can't help it!'. It was just so tiring

If the hospital has therapy groups run by psychologists, try and attend, and ask them about outpatient day programs to go to after you're discharged. That's important so you're less likely to relapse.

If you're allowed outside, find a spot in a relaxing and natural setting within walking distance of the hospital. It will give you a break from its institutional atmosphere.

It really depends on the reason you are there, if you are there on your own term or forcefully was send there at least from my experience.
I wasn't forced to take any meds although every doctor told me to do so but i have a strong no meds policy in any circumstances so it was a no for me.

When you work with them and accept the help they can give you you are treated better.
Though a problem can be the other sick people there, there will be definite people in worse mental states than you and that was quite terrifying to me. I was on high alert most of the time. In the end nothing happened. The thing i disliked the most was being locked away, i literally felt like i was in prison, i had my yard time, food, therapy and other activities. My mind was suffering from that but after a couple of days i was moved to a more ""open"" mental health wing which was better.

In the end it really depends on how the professionals are handling the ward, how much therapy you get, how much assistance they give you and if you for example think about taking meds if they can explain the side effects and what they do to you well and take the time for it.

My first stay was a decent experience, my second stay was personally pure nightmare but it also was during covid which made the thing itself really bad.",,,,,,,,

It was like a pause in responsibilities, I bet it depends a lot on the ward and the group of people that happen to find themselves there. It's not a high success rate by talking to everyone there, most people come back because it becomes a refuge, rarely do people actually get better.

But in my country such sessions happen relatively rarely and the only source of entertainment is talking to your fellow cell mates.

Like most people said, your experience will really vary depending on the facility. I was traumatized by my time there, even at a relatively ""nice"" private hospital. It's shocking and terrifying how quickly you lose all rights and freedoms, plus the ability to maintain your own simple dignities. (Want tampons? Too bad, they have strings. You'll have to use a pad. The idea one could hang themselves with a series of tampon strings is patently ridiculous to me, but whatever).

Pretty much no facility will allow you to have a cellphone. On the whole, I really support that. I would have felt so stressed seeing work emails. That being said, I think internet access is a human right. When you're put on a new med, you don't have the right to Google side effects, or gather information to make an educated decision.

I was told by other patients that you weren't meant to have deodorant, but I did, and it was in plain sight and no one did anything.

Nurses would walk in when you were in the bathroom, for example (there were no doors, nothing movable apart from the main door, the mattress, a rather heavy chair, and the lower part of the toilet seat).

The patients were nice enough; it was the staff that was the issue. Most just didn't care or didn't follow instructions that were on your record. Overall, that ward was a negative experience for me due to my conditions, but it could really help a lot of people. You also need to keep in mind that you have observations, which range from ""are you safe"" once to four times hourly to 1:1 where someone knows what you are doing 24/7 to 1 or many to 1 within arm's reach (imagine being on 4:1) and using the bathroom, although that extreme level is rare.

It is worth noting, from my experience anyway, that there are three types of patients on acute wards: those who are not of sound mind, schizophrenics; those that are psychotic or have cognitive issues; and those with depressive disorders. Finally, there are those who are of sound mind but suffer from various conditions (such as anxiety). Depending on the severity, some in the first category are not capable of interacting with you, although it can be fun to watch them or listen to the incredible delusions they have. The second and third groups, however, are generally normal people; you can interact with them and make friends.

As for boredom, there were some activities, but not many. For me at least, I was always either zoned out (a coping strategy of mine), engaging in OCD compulsions, having extended panic moments, or depressed to the point I wanted to cut myself. I was on edge most of the time, so I never had the opportunity to be bored. There were TVs though, a collection of DVDs, games (with almost all the pieces missing), and artsy stuff to do.

As for the medication, it depends on how you got there and your capacity. In my country at least, if you are there on your own free will, they cannot force any treatment on you. If you are forcibly there for an assessment, it's the same. If, however, you are there forcibly for treatment and if your objections to the medication are not valid or you lack awareness, then they can and will force treatment. It is worth noting that they can still intervene and force things on you regardless of how you got there; for example, if you ODed on something, you can also easily be moved from one category to another.

But honestly, if you have the opportunity to go to a ""nice"" ward under your own free will, then go; you have the right to self-discharge at any time.

The second ward I was in wasn't an acute ward; there you didn't have the first category of patients. You did have a fourth category though: the addicts. This ward was better and worse; you didn't have the clinical nature. It sort of felt more like a hotel; it wasn't an environment where you could relax with respect to your condition. It was noisy, with no activities; you were just in your room or in therapy sessions. The food was decent though, and you actually had real plates with metal cutlery that you could take to your room. There were little restrictions and more privacy. I had a TV in my room and took electronics (that could easily be used for a fatal electrocution). I even asked for some scissors on one occasion, forgot to give them back, had them in my room for like two weeks, during which I stated I was going to kill myself and attempted to leave the hospital, and they never increased my observation level, introduced restrictions, or even checked my room, which was quite funny. But still, for me, it wasn't a positive experience, but that is due to my conditions. If you have the opportunity to go to a treatment hospital, definitely go.

But I've been lucky; other acute wards, especially in other countries, aren't great. But still, if you do end up there, make the most of it; you'll be there for your own good, that is if the so-called ""professionals"" are competent, which is sadly not always the case.",,,,,,,,

open ones tend to be fairly nice, in my opinion. they offer a bit of distraction, feed you a bit of fake hope that feels temporarily good and you possibly meet likeminded people, or at least people who also have issues, and can talk to them a bit. depending on how intensive the therapy is, it gets pretty boring sometimes, but there is usually always a way to fill the time. the one i went to actually did feel like it was focused on recovery, unfortunate that it didnt help me.

closed wards are something else. they just feel like hell. your privacy is stripped away from you, youre not allowed to go outside or even open your window and youre completely shut off from any outside contact as you wont get your phone. the staff is usually overwhelmed and is rude as a consequence.",,,,,,,,

That said - if one were to go by this method, an actual weapon isn't necessary. One could be holding a sandwich wrapped in tinfoil and raise it up only to be sprayed with bullets (thinking of a particular scene in the movie 'Casino'). You're in Sweden though - I imagine the police there aren't looking to unload on civilians for the fun of it.



Police Firearm Use by Country

I was talking about the police the other day with my partner, regarding a woman who was killed by the police recently (US) - they shot her after she threw a candlestick at them.

A fucking candlestick.

Smh.

Police are armed with military grade pepper spray to control crowds, they have taser guns, sticks for beating, and guns. Most of the time, they go for the gun first.

Anyhow, partner and I were once again agreeing, the police are the absolute worst people to call in a mental health crisis, if the person in crisis wants to live.

I don't know if I'd call the police for anything.

In 2015, 2 friends tricked me into getting in the car with them to talk, feigning concern for my mental health which was definitely spiraling downwards however I was no ""danger"" to anyone other than myself. They took me to a general hospital, not a psych hospital (as if those are much better) AND called the police.

When we got there, I bolted from the car and started running. So-called friends were screaming, it was a scene. 3 officers who probably wanted to unload their clips on me instead tackled me, dragged me inside the hospital, and talk about a pig pile - they smashed me on the floor and one officer stuck one of his thumbs in my mouth. It was disgusting, degrading…if they don't kill you, they'll make you wish they did.

I'd traumatize others eitherway no matter what method I'd use, my only quick options are public.

It seems getting the right dosage dialled in is vital.
If dosed to heavy, it literally works in the opposite way. Like for example it can be an oxidiser but also an anti-oxidant depending on dose. It also acts as an anti depressant.
There is rarely any cases off fatality, however there was one published & the fatality was caused through serotonin syndrome & users can't have it, whilst on ssri's/snri's. Serotonin syndrome if led to death seems very slow and painful.
The only thing I could find in regards to fatality is, at approx 265mg/per kg body weight is can be fatal stating- 'coma' or cardiac arrest.

My understanding this far is- it can reverse the effects of sn not binding oxygen with our blood, but dosed at an extremely higher rate would be the reverse and actually prevent our blood from binding oxygen. Would that be what causes a coma? Cardiac arrest seems painful. Maybe that would come after the coma?

This isn't education or advice as I've only spent around 4 hours looking into this.
im hoping for someone who is well versed in this type of thing to help me draw a conclusion or shoot me down lol.
I'm sure I can't be the only one who's been fascinated by this…
It is readily available & legal, the only drawback could be the price for a lethal dosage or maybe the quantity actually needed to ingest could be to much.",,,,,,,,

and male puberty really messed up my body, i couldn't do anything to stop it, my dad even searched my room to see if i had hormones… and i just became a girly looking boy. i started hormones when i was 18, and it's been 7 years, but i think it was too late and my body is really really messed up, mostly my face. i can't ever afford surgery. if i had more body fat it would help but it's really difficult for me to eat and i don't think it would help enough. i don't want to date because i'd be too ashamed to try dating a guy while looking like i do.

i can't look in the mirror without panicking or shaking. whenever i think about my childhood i break. my body like twitches on its own when i do, and i can't react fast enough to prevent that. i'm 25 now and i have no ability to function, and my parents still hate me",2583320,,,,,,,

I guess at least we live in a time where even if your parents aren't accepting, the (first) world at large is about the best it has ever been for trans people or girly looking / acting guys if you want to stop there.

You say you don't want to date a guy looking the way you do...as in, I assume, not female enough. But might you not be a good fit for a gay guy who likes feminine men in the meantime? At least for stuff as casual as dating? Apologies if I'm naive about some of this.",2583334,,,,,,,

i also think i wouldn't make a very convincing guy, even a feminine one. i can't even act like a guy, especially now that i stopped trying to for so long. people would always be able to tell i'm trans, one way or the other.

I am new here, though I have been lurking in the background for a long time. But now I think it's time to be serious and share with other people with similar feelings

My preferred method is hanging or partial suspension. I did make a serious attempt not that long ago, but because I was clumsy, I didn't tie the anchor well enough. I did lose consciousness but I woke up with a bloody nose and blood on the floor. I had to pull myself up from the floor with a bad headache, and bruises around my neck that I had to hide for a week or so.

But it did confirm my feelings that I intend to cancel my future, and it's the right thing for me to do.

Now it's just getting up the courage to do it again with a better knot.

I wish I had some story that explains these feelings, but I don't. I have had a relatively okay existence but there is just this nagging feeling that CTB is the way to go.

Propanolol is still a question mark for me. Like I have experienced 180+bpm when I do intense cardio and it doesn't feel like I'm getting a panic attack or something.

I don't know if it's a benzo, whenever I have a crisis I put one under my tongue and after it dissolves I feel better.

I also have lorazepam 1 mg, which I do know is a benzo, and also zolpidem 10 mg, a hypnotic.

My question is, how much benzo should I take? If I also take 2 zolpidem it shouldn't affect anything, right? If I take a pill 2 hours before it helps me sleep well, and with 2 I have already found that it leaves me groggy. That would help me fall asleep quickly after taking the NS and maybe not vomit.

,2581305,escape_from_hell,"Jul 1, 2024 at 10:33 AM","Instead of begging our own governments to do the correct and adult thing, maybe we should be looking to our alleged enemies for euthanasia help?

There are many countries at war at almost all times throughout all human history. Scores are killed in single actions within minutes or even seconds in pointless battles over mere centimeters of blood, shit, piss, and guts-covered bombed-out terrain. Nobody cares, actually, because it's just so common and seems far removed from the daily life of many citizens. Occasionally, humans go to movie theaters to cry watching rich famous people pretend to suffer like us peons that have participated in such ludicrous conflicts have.

But there's a better way. For example., Russia and the United States (and most of Europe) are in conflict by proxy in Ukraine right now.
What if Russian citizens could send requests to US Diplomats for highly effective suicide kits, and vice versa, EU and USA citizens could ask Russian government officials for such kits?

That way, warring countries can get official ""kills"" without having to sacrifice their prime neurotypical workhouse youths in pointless battles. It's a win-win.

Some points to address very foreseeable questions:
If the kits turned out to be torturous poisons that maim or very slowly and excruciatingly kill, this will be widely known soon and thus is counterproductive for the government trying to score the higher kill count.
Many will say this makes no sense, that war is all about controlling territories and battling for supremacy through military force. However, that military force is not purely represented by a prime fighter on the battlefield. Entire industries and economies must support the war effort. That includes the back-of-house munitions factories, food production, and all that. What about depressed suicidal people being less productive? Many here WISH they could be neets, but few are. Economic conditions are such that many people are forced into a competitive labor market to PAY TAXES. Even neets pay countless taxes: sales tax, vehicle registration, credit card fees that go to big corporations that in turn are paid in at a lower tax rate, property taxes, tolls, fees, so on and so forth. The tax system is not one-size fits all fair flat tax or something, it hits the citizen at every conceivable juncture of activity. Future taxes may be levied, such as breathing and pooping taxes, and normalized thru culture. Thus EVERY citizen is a valid enemy target, or else we would not need militaries for ""defense"" in the first place, and enemy infrastructure would never be damaged due to humanitarian concerns.
It will likely be exponentially cheaper to get 1 kill per unit of currency. Versus putting armor, artillery, troops, drones, and ammunition expended on the battlefield.
Remember, war is ultimately about killing the enemy. Violence is considered a last resort when diplomacy fails. Militaries exist for ""defense"" in the modern era. While some cultures in the past only targeted men and appropriated the women and children as spoils, it is easy to imagine that complete annihilation was just as common, though frowned upon in modern days for public relations purposes. Modern governments have turned the people into highly efficient work and tax-harvestable livestock, investing in things like schools that enculturate children to be workers. Thus every kill counts and your life IS valuable like the pro-lifers say, at least symbolically.
As an added bonus, making such a request could be considered treason, which is punishable by death. Our own governments may start their own mass euthanasia programs to punish, disincentivize (laughable, I know), or even out-compete the enemy suicide kit efforts. How glorious would it be to just have a drone come wipe your ass out because you are a ""terrorist"" without much more effort than shooting an email to the enemy government. Plus, the gestapo/stasi/""homeland security"" can pat themselves on the back, so you are making fellow citizens happy, productive achievers.
We could spare the world the barbaric and destructive practice of conventional warfare. No more infrastructure and pristine ecosystems pointlessly ruined.
The high quality fighting force can be spared to go back to productive economic pursuits, being net-positive taxpayers, and sexual reproduction to produce the next and healthier generation of serfs for their governments. As it stands now many of us veterans are broken citizens after the fact, soaking up space and resources and annoyingly demanding help at veterans hospitals and benefits claims. The depressed and dysgenic suicidal population that never even went to war to begin with is often spared, and their existence inspires those backward and creative tax schemes discussed above to get more out of them when they are inherently not as productive.
Civil conflicts can be transformed into productive, positive diplomatic events. WORLD PEACE is possible! The countries with the highest suicide rates are the official losers and make concessions, due to the fact that their country has proven to have a culture that is more miserable and inhumane than the other country! Thus, more humane and superior cultural practices can be adopted. Also, the weak and pathetic suicidal caste are discarded without horrific eugenics programs, resulting in a robust, healthy population.

Let's end war and bring peace to the planet, a better tomorrow, through offering ourselves!",,,,,,,,
,2581385,waterworks,"Jul 1, 2024 at 11:48 AM","Interesting take, but the point of war is not the kill count. At least, not in modern warfare that is not inspired by religious vendettas or racism.

As you mentioned, there's more to military force than boots on the ground. But the value of a citizen in this scenario is only in as far as they are capable of directly influencing the effort. In that case, not every citizen is a valid target, only those necessary for the military effort. The problem with viewing the value of a citizen through their tax contributions, is that the money they give to the government, was taken from the government in the first place. If the government were one unanimous centralized body, they don't need the average citizen for anything because they have the authority to take money directly from the average citizen with or without their consent. The private industry only thrives in so long as it makes valuable contributions to the central government; if it becomes a liability then capitalism falls apart, which means inevitably everything shifts to a communist system; then they don't need citizens to have a functioning economy, as weird as that sounds. So, the only people suffering in this scenario is the average citizen, because government workers, who would really be the only employed people at this point and actually valuable for the war effort, would be taken care of.

That's only if the kill would have influenced the course of warfare. In which case only the military or people related to the war effort would be of value. Which just takes us back to the reason the war is taking place.

Going back a bit, the only times that I know of where annihilation was valued over assimilation, is when war efforts were either influenced by religion or racial bigotry. In which case, any member of a particular group would be targeted. Where as wars that valued territorial conquest, placed emphasis on assimilation rather than destruction. Meaning, it was more important to convert an enemy to your cause than kill them. Putting in mind logistics, it was impossible for armies to hold large territories and still expand, which is the case with modern conflict. The war Ukraine is about territory, and to control territory, you need as many soldiers as you can get, but you're only valuable in as much as you can be assimilated and contribute otherwise no one truly cares if you die. This is why both Russian and Ukraine forces heavily value propaganda and assimilation.

There is also the likely hood that rather than kill you, they would scoop you away to off-the-books research facilities to act as guinea pigs. Though I doubt even close to as many people as would make a difference would be willing to be executed by the government. Suppose there were even a million. There would be no way for them to prosecute 100,000s of their citizens using the conventional justice system (which would already be backed up) and give each one a fair trial. Which means they would find more, feasible ways to handle these. Either through speedy trials that would mean a lot of people would be dying unfairly, or street justice. Basically the advent of chaos.

Pragmatically, I think this would make everything so much worse, and ruin so many more lives than just having a conventional war.",, , , , , ,,

All the personal stuff aside, the socio-political/economic landscape in the US right now is bleak af. The kind of government we are about to become in November, is going to set the world on an even darker path.

***I am on purpose not going into any political details to try and keep this post from just becoming a warzone. As I know all of here on SaSu are from different versions of this torture simulator we call life. However I have in other threads, made my political stances quite clear.

But we are about to see history repeat itself in real time, in the worst possible way, here in the US.

And I don't want to experience it. I don't want to go through it. Or endure it. Fuck that. And since I'm not allowed to properly defend myself with a gun, I should just fucking be allowed to leave.

The people who are about to take over our gov and country don't even want people like me alive anyway. So why the fuck can't I just piece out of this stupid human bullshit? Like fuck. Just give me the good stuff and then like you don't need to worry your fucked up little capitalist heart's about keeping me alive with social security anymore.

It's literally fucking win-win.

But no. I'm going to be forced, against my will. To experience a fascist take over where I will be targeted for death by the usurpers. Usurpers that the other side is just going to LET happen, because defending ourselves with violent would just...look bad? Or some other stupid fucking kumbaya pansy bullshit.

It's all bullshit. Everything we know is a lie. Everything we believe is a lie. We're not even free.

The sick irony is that most of society believes that if you refuse to participate in it, then you deserve to die anyway for not contributing. So then I'm like, okay I would love to die, please euthanize me nice and peacefully and painlessly, and they go, no, not like that. If you want to leave you need to go through the worst shit ever.

Humans are fucked up. We are not good things in the universe. I HATE that I am human. It's disgusts me on a daily basis. Humans disgust me. We are fucking evil, lie to ourselves about it and then pat ourselves on the back for doing such a good lie. We create so much suffering. Like I struggle to find a valid reason why we even deserve to exist at all. What just because we can think and feel? Pfft.

It all needs to end ideally. But since I don't have godly powers to destroy this planet, I have to settle for just taking myself out. I'm not wanted by those who won't let me kill myself.

You know what that makes me? A fucking HOSTAGE. and yet I'm supposed to find some way to be happy....being a hostage.

I'm about to be forced to watch so many people be harmed after November. There is nothing I can do to stop it. Other than vote. But uhh...votes have no power when a billionaire can give more money to our representatives than we ever can to pass laws they want and overturn the will of the people.

I'm done with this *gestures around frantically*

There is no valid reason why I should have to endure what's about to happen here or the effect it will have on the rest of the world. I can't even buy a gun.

So my only options are poison, OD, cutting, hanging, drowning, or CO2. You know. The worst ones. The painful ones.

Fuck this society. Fuck this species and it's impressive propensity for unconditional cruelty.

Like at this point, I would settle for being murdered.

I read someone committed suicide using guillotine and I don't want to mention it and put the link of the full story here as to respect the person's death as well as that person's family.



I was planning on building a guillotine (not exactly the entire replica of it) and then taking a bunch of sleeping pills so I won't be able to see and feel the decapitation. And since I have some knowledge on engineering, I can build some sort of a robot or a machine that will be able to cut the rope in a given time. Though I am planning to ctb on the year 2033 and I have plenty of time to spare to get ready and set everything up meticulously. I also want to save up some money for my parents and also to complete their dreams like going to different countries and be able to buy stuff they want. I hate how did I even think on doing this method but I felt like this is the only way to die without feeling pain, discomfort, and fear.

,2595054,Lakavi,"Jul 13, 2024 at 1:30 PM","I was going to post a question outlining this exact thing. You could make a really simple device that triggers the blade at some random time of night (I'd probably wake up right before if I knew the time, just like my wakeup alarms) and if you are able to sleep (probably with the help of a bunch of sleeping pills, cuz that would be pretty terrifying to know a blade is gonna come crashing down soon) then you would get the same level of painlessness as any pentobarbital.

It doesn't show up in suicide statistics so it's probably not common. Anyone know why? I mean, I guess it requires some set-up and sleeping pills to be able to actually sleep.
Oh and you would also need to be 100% sure you remain in the correct position in your sleep as well, oof...
I mean you don't have to be asleep, but it would make it more peaceful...

I also wonder, albeit resulting in a peaceful departure for the CTB-er, how do you make it as little.... gruesome for the people who finds you as possible? That could be a tall order...",,,,,,,,
,2595069,Nothing87,"Jul 13, 2024 at 1:54 PM","I already discontinue this plan because I realized the severity of it to the people who will saw my corpse.

Making a DIY guillotine is expensive and time-consuming and it requires a lot of planning and wood-working/carpentry skills to make it happen.

When I planned this method, I thought of placing a tarp and a putting a lot of sawdust to minimize the blood to spread out. To be honest, there is actually no way to make it less gruesome and it's the reason why I discontinue it plus there is a lot of chance for things to go wrong if ever I did this method.",2595054,,,,,,,
,2595082,Lakavi,"Jul 13, 2024 at 2:03 PM","That's fair. I am looking into if it is even possible to synthesize pentobarbital at home, since it is arguably the single best way to go but also 99% impossible to get your hands on unless you are a veterinarian or one of the rare PAS doctors.

But I'm not discounting the guillotine for me personally entirely. Yes there's some setup. Yes there's a risk of your landlord (if you have one) finding out before it's done and yes, there will be a lot of blood.
However, I am getting a bit desperate and if I have to I will prioritize my own well-being (or need for a lack of being).
That's not to say it will be my first choice though.

I am by no means handy, but I could figure it out I think. The contraption itself isn't too complicated.
I am going to make a detailed 3D sim of it, so we'll see what my thoughts are after that.

Do you have another plan or are you one of the lucky ones who have found the will to live?",2595069,,,,,,,

Have you ever thought of finding other methods?",2595082,,,,,,,
,2595109,Lakavi,"Jul 13, 2024 at 2:30 PM","Of course.
I do not consider myself a handy person, but I have worked on barn roofs and power station maintenance when I was younger.
That being said though, I am pretty confident in acquiring the knowledge to do stuff, and this is a contraption that was made in the late 1700s.

Furthermore, I am a person who gets very anxious about every little thing:
I had access to a HK416 when I was in the army and found myself in a situation where I could have pulled the trigger on myself on a day off I was alone in my room in the barracks. Just me, the HK416 and a single bullet.

The reason I didn't pull the trigger; knowledge of how the high velocity 5.56 round affects bone, ""pulling"" them along, rather than going straight through (possibly), more so than 7.62 rounds.
If my angle was slightly off, which was awkward with an assault rifle, I just imagined half my face missing or my brain just seeping out.

For all I know, the exit and entry would have been clean, but this doubt meant I couldn't do it.
Still regret it though as it will probably remain the time where I had access to the most painless exit.

So for the guillotine, if I sense anything is not guaranteed to go 100% to plan, I won't do it ^^",2595101,,,,,,,
,2595538,Nothing87,"Jul 14, 2024 at 12:25 AM","Well, since you are eager to do this method I respect you and I won't stop you. I just hope it turns out well and Goodluck! Also keep in mind that you are not actually quickly unconscious after the decapitation happened you will be conscious for like 15 - 30 seconds.

If you are gonna make a DIY guillotine make it higher as possible to gain sufficient momentum and also make sure the blade is heavy and sharp to make a clean cut, it takes a lot of planning, precision, revising, and testing to make it happen. Goodluck!",2595109,,,,,,,

I think one of the main reasons is loving someone. When you love someone so much you don't ever want to leave them, you want to be with them. The problem is I can't really be with this person because distance is one of the main issues. And thats why it becomes one of the reasons i want to ctb because i want to be with this person so bad but im not sure if i will be able to be in the future and it eats me up alive. But again at the same time there's a chance i could be with this person in the future so im worried if i end it now i wont be able to experience that.

I will die slowly from a Paracetamol Overdose thats fine because everyday I am slowly dying,2595128,FireFox,"Jul 13, 2024 at 2:51 PM","Paracetamol overdoses is known to be a painful death but I am taking that risk.To be saved from a Paracetamol overdose a person has be given an antidote called Intravenous acetylcysteine. The is antidote is effective in preventing liver damage only when given within 8 hours of the overdose. If a person is outside the 8 hour window they will slowly die from liver failure within days.

This is a risk I will take because at least I will die. Dying slowly doesn't scare me anymore because everyday I can feel my soul and myself dying.

Everyday when I look in the mirror to see my eyes all I see is nothing deep inside. What I mean by nothing is no spark, no warmth, no joy and all I see an empty tunnel . I don't recognise my reflection anymore all I see is a stranger behind the glass mirror. I don't even have the flu but everyday I feel flu like, i dont understand this . Just like the flu I am chronically exhausted all the time, I keep crying with my eyes being with my eyes puffed up and I struggle with breathing sometimes due to stress and anxiety.

My body no longer feels under my control but under the control of something else, a darker entity. Everyday I feel it. Having an eating disorder along with suicidal thoughts feels like having a doppelganger within you that stalks, shadows your life and slowly works to steal everything good you have in your life until it finally takes over your life.
As grow older I realise now people die from suicide not because their bodies succumbed to the illness but because the illness, the doppelganger won in taking total dominance of that person's body, mind and soul.

At 25 years old in 2022 my life was at an all time high and for the first time in my life I was happy and no longer suicidal. When I talk about how amazing 2022 was to people it feels like a dream but it wasn't a dream it was so real. In Autumn had the most amazing holiday in Venice, weeks later I gave my strongest ever interview performance and secured a higher paying job. I fell in love with a 55 year old older man he made me feel so special. Winter it was snowing in England during my lunch break I went to the park and seeing the snowfall it felt so magical because the first time in my life I see how beautiful things are becoming. Christmas was so amazing. I miss that year so much. 2023 was when everything constantly wrong for me since New Years Day. I went from having the best year of my life to the worst year of my life . If those events i went through in 2023 didn't happen i wouldn't be suicidal.

Turning 27 in May I was so upset this how my life turned out to be. I am constantly unsuccessful with men and unable to get over the heartbreak and pain this man has caused me while everyone else I grew up with is married or have children, my confidence is gone after getting fired last year from my first serious job after graduating university, living with my mother, i am immature for my age and the realisation of the loneliness in my life Now I am at risk of losing my university place which I was forced to defer last year.

I am under enormous stress currently waiting for the decision my masters loam application to get approved because staff Student Finance England and university I have a place for keep messing up the paperwork landing me in problems. If I don't get my application approved I will kill myself losing that place means I lose everything. Everyone around me has something big in their lives a successful career, a marriage or some big achievement what I have got to show for my life ? Nothing, I am just a loser

I never used to believe in bad luck but now I believe its real because things constantly keep going wrong for me especially at the last minute whenever I am approaching something good. I am sick and tired of fighting and the constant cycle of things going wrong.
I have finally reached breaking point. I am never going to have those good times again I had at 25. My life at 27 is over, it feels like it everyday.",,,,,,,,

SFE is such a pain, I really hope you will wait and consider all options for funding and alternative paths (so many careers don't require masters or you can get jobs that pay to do masters whilst working) . You are not a loser, I know it doesn't seem like it but so many people in their 20s and beyond have no idea wtf they're doing (me included). I do understand that your reasons are more complex though and not just about 1 thing.
I'm not going to talk you out of ctb, as that is your choice. I am so sorry for all the pain you have endured and enduring as it sounds like you really can never catch a brain. I understand wanting to end that. It seems so exhausting and you deserve peace in whatever way you wish.

But I just hope you reconsider your method. Or at least you fully understand it first as info in your post is wrong.

I just wanted to point out that NAC is effective after 8hrs. It just reduces in efficiency but even after 24hrs people have survibed. The generally wait until 4hrs to do blood tests as it needs time to absorb into your blood and then by the time treatment is started it can be longer. So they really wouldn't risk waiting 5hrs if it was so ineffective after 8. Efficacy starts to reduce after 8hrs, significantly more after 16 and then 24hrs but still has a chance.

Here's from an nhs site - ""Acetylcysteine IV (N-acetylcysteine, Parvolex®, NAC) is the treatment of choice. It has near 100% efficacy in preventing paracetamol-induced hepatotoxicity if given within the first 8 hours from ingestion of overdose. It may also be effective up to and possibly beyond 24 hours. ""

Yes it might have been paracetemol or could have been any other hepatotoxic drugs or a combination. No way of knowing.
Not denying people die from paracetamol OD as there are many cases. However, so many more tried and failed (myself included). Plenty of times I've been in a&e and heard other patients having NaC, it is extremely common and deaths are rare these days. Individual effects vary too as some people's livers can just handle more than others.

I don't understand why you'd pick paracetamol? As someone that has OD'ed on it many times, I can tell you it isn't just painful.. it is the most excruciating agony you will ever experience, and will not be worth it.

You will be SCREAMING in agony, and it won't be for a short while either, and there will be absolutely nothing anyone can do for you. You'll be literally throwing it up, and even that is... the most excruciating pain ever, that's without all the stomach pain.

You ever thrown up ACID? That's how it feels. Like pure acid. Everything burns - your stomach, oesophagus, mouth, throat. Everything will feel like you're on FIRE ON THE INSIDE. You won't be able to talk either, because every little movement will be so painful, because you've just been throwing up ACID. And it's all you'll be able to taste, and absolutely nothing will ease it, or get rid of it. Water will make you feel sick, everything will, and it'll burn in your mouth. Paracetamol vomit sticks around for a while, too.

I still rememeber the last time I overdosed on it, probably 10-12 years ago now. Never did it again, I finally learned my lesson, and I took a lot. I was in my early 20s at the time, and struggling a lot, like you, couldn't see a way out, I thought that was it, but I was so wrong.

There is no guarantee it will kill you either, the liver can absorb a lot, you would be surprised. I have OD'ed on many things over the years, and a few times I didn't get help - I was jaundice for a bit though.

3 days isn't a guarantee either. There is absolutely no guarantee you'll die, perhaps of liver failure a long time later - who knows? But until then, you'll be in excruciating pain. Or perhaps you won't die. It is not worth the pain

Both options will always cause pain, but which will be greater?

Note hits greatly all at once, but at least they will know for sure what's up, might move on faster and for good.

Randomly disappearing brings lesser pain in the moment, but longterm hurt of worry and wonder. Creating fake hopes of being still around.

My life is awesome and I hate it.,2595555,SchizoGymnast,"Jul 14, 2024 at 12:55 AM","My life has really sucked lately. I got kicked out of my home. I lived in my car with four cats, which led to me being harassed by police and animal control. I had my finances ruined, got repeatedly bullied by a coworker, had to make major car repairs, and had pneumonia for a month. It was during this period that I actually discovered this site.

Then things rapidly turned around for me. I found a new place to live, near the lake and the mountains, with all my cats. I got my dream job and a raise at my current job. I was asked to host a national event for one of my favorite nonprofits. I'm seeing my friends and family, engaging in hobbies, and I have no reason whatsoever to complain.

So why am I complaining?

There's a certain safely in being the failure I always thought I was. I could skate by in menial jobs, veg out in front of the TV and engage with my voices all day. Easy. No pressure. But people are starting to notice that I'm capable of shit and I'm exhausted and overwhelmed. I'm afraid that I conned my way into these opportunities and it's only a matter of time before I screw them up.

I also believed for years that I was destined to die an early death. And that's how I lived. I had fun and loved my family and friends because I didn't count on surviving for long. First it was 17. Then it was 21. Then it was 25. And so on. Well, I'm about to be 35 and I'm coming to the realization that, so far, I'm projected to live a long life. I now have to think about things like career, family, retirement, etc whereas previously the only future planning I did was for my funeral.

Lastly I'm having new health concerns that could be minor...or possibly something serious. Part of my ""live for today"" mindset was engaging in self neglect and now I'm concerned I'm paying the price. I'm seeing a doctor soon but right now all I can do is wait.

Thinking about death and selfishness.,2595504,onceremoved126,"Jul 13, 2024 at 11:06 PM","This is a separate thread than my usual venting.

For the past couple of days, I've been contemplating death again. I've been thinking about dying, and it excites me as much as it scares me.

I've always thought that once I'll die, I'd finally be free from all of my burdens. That I'd finally be too dead to care about anything that happens after. I've been close to people that now are dead, I've known death before I knew multiplication and the verb to be. Despite all of that, I'm terrified of the process of dying. Knowing that a person is dying is way more terrifying and sad than knowing that someone IS dead.

I myself are slowly but surely dying. I have a mental disorder that has one, if not the highest, the death rate. They don't make it past thirty something. All of this made me realize that I am dying and that I might never get proper treatment to prevent me from doing so. The truth is, I'm terrified that one day I'm going to die, and I'll have to live through the process of dying. I think I've made peace with being dead, but I'm scared of that small window of when I'm alive and when I'm dead.

Thinking so much about this reminded me that my best friend told me he wanted to die too, that he's tired, but he couldn't do it for his family and for me. I wish that I could've told him that I understood that I was also tired, but I couldn't. I basically begged him for his own life, and I felt extremely selfish, but I didn't care. Last year, I told him I wanted to die because I didn't see a future in which I was happy, and he basically begged me for my life. I realized that that was very selfish of him, but I somehow didn't really care. That made me realize that we're both selfish. We both want the other to live, but we don't want to live ourselves.

Some people may benefit from that selfishness because some people don't want to die, they just want their issues to be gone, and death does sound appealing. That selfishness can help them build a support system and whatnot and finally be free from their burdens.

People like me, however, don't benefit from it. My mental disorders have made me into an asocial person. I simply can not form a support system or a community or a found family or whatever. The way my brain works and how I was raised only allows me to have shallow relationships with people. Every time I've allowed myself to have something deeper, it ends up ruined. Many people say, ""If x and y thing were/weren't in my life, I'd be so much happier."" I've tried to find what would make me happy, but the more I look for, the more I realize there's nothing. There's nothing that would make me feel happy or fulfilled. Not even the selfishness of my best friend can keep me alive for much.

I just wish that dying didn't terrify me, I would've been in peace for a while now.",,,,,,,,

To say I was devastated is a vast understatement. My husband pushed for me to adopt a deaf puppy, who I love dearly now, but for a few weeks I was so upset and overwhelmed and resentful. Resentful towards him and the puppy. I had finally been almost free from obligations to stay alive, but now my little puppy adores me and I her, so I am once again shackled to existence. She is now 6 months old, and I am no longer resentful of her or my husband for making me get her. I love her, but its just not the same as my Ellie. She adores me so much though, she cries and screams for me when I leave for work even when my husband is home, so I couldnt imagine leaving her. Atleast not right now, but I am semi-stable at the moment. As stable as I am capable of being.
I think it would be best if you could stay around long enough for your kitty, they dont understand stuff. But by all means I understand if your not able to do that, no judgement or pressure or anything. One thing I recommend is leaving a will of who her guardian should be. I also used to tell my husband if anything ever happened to me, I wanted Ellie to see my dead body. I have seen animals understand a dead body, so to me it seems like if they atleast see our dead body they might understand we didnt just up and leave them.

It is obviously more complicated than requesting to die peacefully, since it is a human's life on the line but I know whatever is going on there is a huge step towards something revolutionary, for people like us.

It's just sad that a lot of people disagree with allowing people to die a dignified death if they want it, because their life is genuinely unenjoyable even with the most help that could have been gotten. It is selfishness, they don't want to suffer themselves, what would obviously happen if someone they knew died so they force the people who are actually suffering to continue suffering until their times comes, naturally or if they ctb themselves which is very hard to do. I'm sure all of us know that by now.

At least Canada is doing something like this, it is arguably worse than what Belgium is doing but at least a country that is very similar to the US in terms of it's people, they're starting somewhere. By the way, a friend of mine told me you could die on command in Sweden as well but I don't know how it works, I haven't heard of it before causing me to be incapable of looking into it since I don't have enough resources.
Yeah that is true but in more openminded countries (mainly Scandinavian countries, since they were the ones who legalized a lot of things before anywhere else), having a mental illness would make you qualified for being able to die via euthanasia. And like I said in this post, it is not that easy to do so since a human life is on the line but it is indeed possible. It will just take some time and the decision definitely depends on the doctor's personal philosophy and that of many other people who are in charge of providing you with the means of dying a peaceful and dignified death. Your decision would of course matter but it is very complicated to make the choice to allow you to die.
It really isn't that easy, a human's life is on the line so it is a very hard decision, to make this decision would also require philosophy as well as concern for others and how their day to day situation is unbearable and possibly worsening.

I doubt suicide prevention would be abolished any time soon, at least in our lifetimes but I know with the right choices and the right influences it'll definitely happen soon.",2226687,2226114,,,,,,
Where people can die in peace: Belgium,2226861,Falling Slowly,"Nov 6, 2023 at 2:49 PM","After 3 physicians were put on criminal trial in Belgium in 2020 for not following the proper procedures in euthanising a woman (the jury found them not-guilty), stricter guidelines were brought in for Belgian physicians in relation to euthanasia for psychiatric-related cases.

""Physicians are now under a deontological obligation to comply with the following guidelines, aimed at ensuring a high standard of care. First and foremost, at least two of the three physicians involved in evaluating a psychiatric patient's euthanasia request should be psychiatrists. The attending physician should have regular face-to-face discussions with the consulted physicians about the fulfillment of the legal criteria. These consultations must be recorded in a written report. Although euthanasia on a non-terminally ill person who suffers from a psychiatric illness can legally be performed after at least 1 month has passed counted from the date of the patient's first request, this time-frame is considered too short for the comprehensive evaluation of the euthanasia request.
Second, a patient can only be considered untreatable if all reasonable treatment options have been attempted. The physicians must be convinced that, from an objective medical-psychiatric perspective, there is no longer any reasonable treatment that can improve the patient's condition and alleviate their suffering. Hence, a euthanasia request cannot be granted if a psychiatric patient refuses to undergo certain evidence-based treatments.
Third, the attending physician should encourage the patient to involve their relatives in the euthanasia procedure, unless there are good reasons not to do so. As is clarified in the guideline of the Flemish Society of Psychiatry, involving relatives might not only contribute positively to the grieving process of the latter, but it is also important to ascertain that the euthanasia request of the patient did not come about as a result of external pressure (21).
Fourth and final, as regards the evaluation of the well-considered nature of the request, it is acknowledged that a psychiatric disorder can affect the patient's mental competence, but that this is not automatically the case. This will require a careful and comprehensive assessment by the three physicians involved""

Good Luck to find 2 or 3 psychiatrist who agree to accept your request with the motive of depression. A lot of psychiatrist think that suicidality is just a symptom of your depression so they won't take you seriously.
it would also be frowned upon by their colleague to accept it.
Most will try dozens of medications wich can worsened your condition as they can make you emotionaly numb, have disabling secondary effects and in the long term, can cause severe damages ( i took antidepressants for 4 years and when i stopped them, i had electric shock in my head and my body during 1 year, this is also called brain zap ). Some will have sexual disorder or anhedonia for the rest of their life. You will have to go through a lot of treatments before to convince on of them. For exemple, they will certainly suggest you to try electroshock ( wich doesn't make sense for me, if you really want to die why do some electoshock will change anything to your will ? it create some new neuronals connections and generate new neurones, will it change anything if your life is pointless and/or you can't manage to live with yourself and the way you function.)
After you did that electroshock thing, you will have to go trough many therapy in wich you're going to pretend you want to recover.
The number of therapy which exist are significant so at what point can we say we have tried everything? How long will it last until we can finaly get euthanasia ?

I joined the site last last year and have browsed since.

A biological weapon was used on me last year and it messed my body up. I've been suicidal ever since then and hope to go when the time is right.

However, the difficulty I have is that I've confided to my family about my plans and despite my constant suffering they are insistent that I stay alive, it is this guilt that is keeping me here. Does anyone else have a similar predicament? Having people who care about me so much feels like a burden and it is just sustaining my suffering when I could end it.",,,,,,,,

,2577498,AnonymousCrisis,"Jun 28, 2024 at 4:38 AM","After I give birth and spend a bit of time with my baby, I plan on ending my life. I'm 18, I fell in love with a guy who I've been dating for a year. I got pregnant shortly into the pregnancy. Needless to say, while the relationship was so, so loving it was so toxic and abusive on both sides. I saw a part of myself come out that I never wanted to see. I've said so many hurtful things that I never thought I was possible of even wording.

It's honestly terrible but I grew up being groomed left and right for years. People who I thought were my friends weren't. I was a chronic people pleaser with no boundaries, and it ended up hurting my boyfriend a lot. A few months into the relationship, my boyfriend thought I was cheating on him while I was getting out of work. It wasn't me, and while I don't know who he saw, I had 2 co-workers that night who looked similar to me. The fact he thought I could cheat on him broke me. He was and still is my favorite person to ever exist on this earth and I could never imagine doing that. He ended up trying to leave that night and I couldn't handle it. I ended up overdosing for the first time, and I ended up on life support and then was sent to a facility for a week because I made a deal with the doctors. I was a minor at the time which made everything much more difficult. By the time I got out I begged my boyfriend to stay, and he agreed. I ended up getting pregnant about a month later.

It's been hard because he's cheated on me a couple times. It was because he was convinced I had cheated. It hurt because I could never do that to him, but I understood why he did. He was hurt. I feel so sad, because I wanted this relationship to work out so bad. He was the first guy I've ever dated, kissed, I gave him every part of me. I feel so terrible for ever hurting him at any point in the relationship. It hurts because while he's also hurt me, he's such a great lover and person in so many different ways. He was the first person to ever genuinely listen to me and my feelings. It hurts so bad, but he's the only thing that makes me feel better. After getting pregnant, I've just realized I probably won't ever be a good mother. I already love my baby so much, but if I'm this mentally ill I know it'll damage her and I can't do that to her. I'm just so damaged mentally. I don't even have friends. The one ""best friend"" I did have who treated me terribly I knew for 8 years and she ended up trying to send her nudes to my boyfriend. When my boyfriend showed me what she tried to do it completely broke me. I may have been a shitty partner, but I always treated her so amazingly. She's the person who saved my life the night I overdosed, and she was the first person I told when I found out I was pregnant, and she still did all of that.

I'm just so tired of living. The guy I love isn't in love with me. I know he loves me, he's shown me that countless times, but he isn't in love with me. My ""friends"" end up betraying me, I fight a painful chronic illness and I'm so tired of being in physical pain, I feel like I look absolutely crazy to my family, and while I love my baby so much I know my mental health will negatively impact her life. My boyfriend plans on getting a paternity test after I give birth for reassurance which I understand. Once those show him it's his baby and he puts his name on the certificate I truly think I'm going to go through with everything and end my life. I'm so tired and I just don't want to do it anymore. I just really needed to vent and get this off my chest.",,,,,,,,

I'm of the opinion that, if you're bringing life into this world, you have a big responsibility and having the baby just to immediately ctb is wrong in many levels. Don't put too much trust into that man, he really doesn't seem as great as you seem and, even if he is, people change when their partners die. Trust me, I've seen it first hand.

Second you've only been together for 1 year, that's barely the honeymoon phase which last about 1 to 2 years and after that you begin to see the other person's flaws. Sorry to say this but that's why young people should not be dating because they're doing adult things when they are children themselves seriously at 18 people still think like they're 15.

Now the best thing you can do is focus on getting better, forget about him if he's abusive that won't change trust me even therapist advise to leave an abusive partner.

Firstly of all, I want to say that I read your post and that I was deeply moved by it. I can feel your distress through your post and I'm deeply, terribly sorry for everything you've gone through. The people around you sound like absolute assholes and I get that that must feel awfully, tormentingly lonely.

Secondly of all; feel free to discard this if it's not something that you want to hear, but just know I'm not the one who likes to moralize on what other adults do with their own lives, so this comes from a place of genuine internet stranger care:

Please consider other options than ending it. I know that that sounds way easier than it actually is, and maybe you thought about other options already just to end up in circles and get overwhelmed at the idea. There are other things to do in seemingly impossible situations than to CTB though, even if they are hard to find. In my experience - sometimes the things even tend to find you when you least expect it. In just a month you are going to have someone who'll love you more than anything else in this world and that kid can consider themselves lucky because that love is so clearly mutual and you haven't even met them yet! Don't blow that, especially over some immature asshole! Maybe see this as an opportunity to start fresh, get yourself away from those people who are clearly just degrading you. I can promise that that is going to do wonders for your mental health too. You're not mentally ""ill"" (personally I don't believe that's even a thing), you're hurt and there's a reason for it.

They did away with the electric chair here in the US years ago for death row inmates because the courts ruled it was cruel and unusual punishment. I think your insides literally fry. Even your nails can pop off. It's like torture. Most people looking to kill themselves try and find a more peaceful method. Had a friend years ago die by electrocution. He was an electrician. He was up on one of those ""boom"", or lifts, from a truck and the boom accidentally made contact with high voltage wires. Not sure his death was instant, or not, tbh.

Já estive aqui muitas vezes, inclusive há uns 3 anos atrás consegui SN e tomei, enquanto conversava no chat com os colegas desse fórum. Nunca senti tanto amor e paz enquanto vocês seguravam minhas mãos, fui encontrada por meu irmão porque tive medo, perto do fim, e consegui ligar pra ele. Ele viu o fórum aberto e no hospital conseguiram identificar o que eu tinha ingerido. Estive meses e meses em recuperação.

Enquanto lutava pela minha vida, sim eu lutei por ela, todas as coisas que me oprimiam continuavam ao meu redor… ser uma adulta funcional, uma Mlr bem sucedida, uma mãe exemplar… simplesmente tentar existir. Tentar sobreviver em meio a esse mundo cão, esse caos que é o Brasil, ser pobre, ser mulher, ser mãe… tudo isso é difícil demais pra mim.

Eu me agarrei a um fio. Eu me agarrei em meu filho, no sentido do que o meu ctb poderia causar nele. Um adolescente lindo, cheio de vida, sensível e que me ama profundamente.

Eu amo meu filho com todas as minhas forças, amo meu filho com todo o âmago do meu ser. E me dói profundamente deixá-lo e feri-lo.
Mas eu não consigo mais.

Viver nessa dor constante. Nessa miséria de ser humano constante… e hoje entendo que é isso que sou, humana. Eu sinto demais… eu vejo demais…

Não consigo me encaixar em absolutamente nada, em nenhum contexto.

Eu só queria ter certeza que depois daqui, existe algo melhor, que isso vai passar, que essa tonelada de conceitos, ideias, sentimentos, massa negra não estarão sobre mim após o ctb.
Assim como eu queria não causar dor na única pessoa que eu amei, a pessoa com a qual dividi a minha alma, não vivesse o resto de sua vida sob o impacto do que eu fiz. Como dizer a ele que a vida pode ser linda, que pode ser revigorante e que ele é muito amado? Como pedir que ele me perdoe e que se existir algo além dessa dimensão, eu estarei esperando ansiosamente por ele? Pelo seu sorriso?

Mas como dizer que mesmo assim eu não fui feita pra isso? Que eu desisti da vida, mas não desisti dele? Afinal, eu daria a minha vida pela dele?

Eu te amo, meu filho. Amo seu sorriso, seus olhos amendoados, seu senso de humor sarcástico, sua inteligência. Amo sua personalidade. Amo até seu desleixo.

Eu espero que você encontre meus diários e o caderno de capa marrom com desenho de borboletas que fiz e escrevi muitas coisas só pra você, só para os seus olhos verem! Eu estarei com você na sua formatura, no seu casamento. Estarei com você em todos os momentos. Por que é simplesmente impossível que esse amor todo que eu sinto por você, não deixe um rastro na história, na presente e na futura.

Eu te amo e te vejo no que quer que seja existe após a vida.
Se não houver nada, que meu imenso amor te guie e ilumine por onde você for!

Até mais.",,,,,,,,

I think you have more issues with Mass laws, amongst the most restrictive in the counyry, though, since they're so strict and make you jump through hoops to get one (See Below):

A FID2 authorizes a person to possess, purchase, or carry only a non large capacity rifle or shotgun and feeding devices and ammunition therefor. The card ""shall be issued"" by the police chief to a person residing or having a place of business within his jurisdiction, unless the applicant has:

*a disqualifying conviction or juvenile adjudication;
*been confined for mental illness or confined or treated for drug addiction or drunkenness;
*is a fugitive;
*is subject to a domestic protective order;
*is an alien;
*is under 15 or is more than 15 and less than 18 and does not have parental or guardian permission.

""Confined"" is such a broad term. It's hard to know what it means specifically.

Another day of doing absolutely nothing, even though I had a lot to do. I don't know why I'm holding out a couple more years to ""get things done"" if I never fucking do anything. I should know better, that's a part of why I want to die. But, it really shouldn't be hard. I had literally one thing to do today. One. Single. Fucking. Thing. I did goddamn nothing all day. I hate doing this, every day is wasted, and it just makes me hate myself more and more. I know stabbing has to be one of the least effective methods, and yet whenever I fuck something up again, I vividly daydream about stabbing myself over and over and over and slowly bleeding to death. I need to learn to give up some day, I'm basically torturing myself.

I'm not even working towards a degree yet, I'm still doing core courses. I'm so far behind, I'll never catch up. And is there even any hope if I've spent the past few years doing barely anything with my life? I doubt it. I'll probably drop out again or kill myself, or maybe both in that order. I'm so useless.

I try to think so hard about every single thing I do before doing it, because I know I'm an idiot who gets everything wrong. I Google even simple, common sense questions, to be sure. Still, I somehow make mistakes anyways. I don't get how it's possible. I think of myself as a careful person, even overcautious cause of anxiety, but I'm just so awful at everything that it seems like I don't even try. I don't even know how it's possible for anyone to be so stupid.

,2549382,excellum,"Jun 5, 2024 at 6:16 AM","This sounds a lot like me. I used to internalize a lot of hatred towards myself because I thought changing was so easy, yet I couldn't take the first step. Granted, I'm still not where I want to be, and I still struggle with suicidal ideation, but a lot of the self-hatred ceased once I learned how the human brain works. How our brain functions is not so different from a human 300,000 years ago, as we're pretty much atomically the same - we're still Homo sapiens. The problem is you weren't born 300,000 years ago when all we had to do was find food, play, raise kids, and occasionally we'd come face-to-face with a predator. That is when our fight-or-flight kicked in.

Today this anxiety response gets triggered constantly by thinking about bills, house payments, car payments, worrying about becoming destitute, perceived cultural obligations, degrees, money. Once it is triggered, your brain literally can't tell the difference between that and a physical tiger in front of you, because it doesn't have the capacity to, it's just running code to keep you alive. We're pretty unique though, like you won't find a Zebra suffering from crippling anxiety because a lion might eat them in the future - it's just going to do Zebra things until it has to run away from the lion. I'm not trying to romanticize Paleolithic living, but it's not your fault our culture panned out like this when we're obviously not biologically attuned to it.

This stuff around you evolved, and continues to evolve at light-speed compared to us. You had no control over any of it. Even if someone decides to change, and they find the will to do it, they have no control over their environment and the material quantum fluctuations in their body and brain that bring about that disposition in response. What does that say about praise or punishment? It doesn't make sense. If you want to learn more about that, you can look up determinism. Robert Sapolsky is a neurobiologist that I haphazardly paraphrased here, but I recommend his work.

Learning about this stuff helped me realize I was being unnecessarily hard on myself. It also absolved me of some culpability for how I turned out. Though, at first, I relied too heavily on this perspective as a crutch in order to avoid doing the hard thing. It's very tempting to do that, but my decisions ultimately affect those around me. I don't think free will exists, but society runs as if it does so we have no choice but to pretend and play along. It's on us at the end of the day to subject ourselves to the randomness of the universe and adapt. I hope this didn't come off offensive or tone deaf, I have no idea what your circumstances are and I don't have any easy solutions, but I hope I did ""something"" to help another human being, whatever that is.",2549328,,,,,,,

One of the main reasons I have these long breakdowns/episodes/whatever you'd call them and waste hours of my day is just to recover from talking to people. I've just been dissociating and self harming for hours, and it's just because I had to take a phone call for a while. It stressed me out so much, I could hardly control myself for about four hours. I know that's insane. That's why I'm cooked. I started noticing a couple days ago how I can't get anything done after a phone call. I thought at first it was just when the call was serious or heavy, but tonight, it wasn't any of those things. It was pretty simple, even fun at some points. But I felt so overwhelmed I lost control.

How am I ever going to do anything? Can't even talk to someone without dissociating, what's wrong with me?

I think it's a little better with the people I live with, because I have more time to get used to it. I'll have to start keeping track of it, though. It's not like talking to my parents doesn't stress me the hell out, lol.

Is it even possible to get by without talking to people? And why do I LOVE talking online, like here, but lose my fucking mind when I have to call someone?? It makes no sense. Like I've said, I feel like suicide is unavoidable for me, and this is another reason why

Rarely does anybody discuss the potential of things to stay the same, stagnate, or even worse: compound and manifest in a multitude of negative ways.

All my life I've been told that things will get better. That I have the potential to do better, do great things, succeed, and be happy.
I've been depressed since my early childhood, and suicidal since my early teens. My life has been a conglomeration of almost comical mishaps, and a series of unfortunate events. I have accomplished things against all odds, and I have also thrown everything to the wind. If you put my circumstances on paper, nobody would expect anything to have become of me.

And honestly, I give up. I no longer want to suffer. Call me a coward if you will. But everybody who has told me it would get better lied. If anything, they indirectly lead to prolongation of my suffering by dangling false bits of hope in front of me. When I look at my life and everything that has happened since the conception of my suicidal ideation, I cannot point to any specific moment or accomplishment, and say ""wow, the world is a better place because I hung in there."" or ""wow, I'm really glad I didn't give up, look what became of me and the great things that have happened"". No. I look back in time and say fuck, I should have ended it all when I had the chance, when SN was more readily available and less popularized. When I could have gotten it in such a dystopian way through Amazon Prime 2-day delivery instead of having to jump through hoops to find it on the black market. I say why am I still here. Why am I wasting resources, space, and the time of others when I clearly no longer want to help myself. There are people out there desperately fighting to live, doing everything in their power to survive, or others who have life taken from them too young. Why do I have this life while those people have it stolen from them? People who actually have a purpose and reason for being here die all the time. And here I am, wasting away, having wasted years in absolute unproductivity, sloth, and anger.

I hate myself. I hate the way I treat others because I hate myself. It has not gotten better and I should have done it when I had the chance. Now I will stay and suffer until another opportunity presents itself.",,,,,,,,

It's funny that you mention you would have only bothered to purchase it from Amazon because I'm the same way I recently purchased it from Amazon last week. It was available for a while but due to the recent legislation it's now pulled off again for anyone that doesn't own a business.

I know it's probably disheartening here that you could have gotten near 2 day prime shipping if you were monitor Amazon more closely.

A long time ago someone Said to me to just hold on for as long as I was able to and if I gotta let go it's alright. If you're truly at your limit no ones angry with you that you reached your limit. However I should say that you're not a waste of resources it's been a pleasure having you with us as long as you were able to stay. It's alright if you are unhappy with the way you treat others it's all right if you're a villain or a hero.

The current culture is always self improvement but it's much more difficult than anyone makes it out to be. Ironically the most control I've ever been able to exert over myself is just letting go and being OK with how things are. Being alright with myself whether I was a villain or not. Ironically I turned up not to be a villain but to be honest I don't really care either way I don't feel like it was something in my control.

I know that you're suffering Probably won't diminish but I hope someday your able to let go of the hate that you have for yourself. My DMS are open if you ever need anyone to talk to.

,2590433,needthebus,"Jul 9, 2024 at 7:46 AM","I was violently sexually assaulted at one point in my life. It changed my ability to experience love and I still have pain down there.

It's so humiliating.

I am thinking about making a ""Me Too"" video and posting it online before ending it all.

I am in so much pain, it's like screaming horrible emotional agony every second. The worst part is this injustice happened and no one cares, nothing has happened to the person who did it who still gets to live a nice life and fall in love and be happy and have a normal job. I am ruined. I am in pain, I will never be in love, I am always injured and unhappy.

I have read about honor killings before and I know everyone in Western Society is horrified by honor killings, and often they are done in very sexist ways or for homophobic or discriminatory reason. But I feel so completely fucking abandoned by society and my family and everyone. I did try to report what happened, my family knows. And this person just exists in this normal happy life. It's so unfair and cruel. The fact that this person is living a normal life, has never been arrested, nothing has ever happened to him, and my family goes on with their normal lives, would never do anything to stand up for me, is a horrible degradation. I look ""okay"" but I am in pain, I can't have normal sex anymore, I am already dead. And everyone just treats it like ""oh, you should just talk about your feelings"" but no one is enraged about what was done, no one cares.

I think I want to make a Me Too video of what happened and then just end my life as soon as possible. I have some ""receipts"" that this happened, but I think no one will give a fuck. The extent to which no one cares about me or my life or my well-being is astounding to me, just no one gives a fuck at all. The injustice and horror and cruelty of this world are so fucking overwhelming and disgusting. I think after I post the Me Too video in multiple places, I am going to kill myself probably within a day or two. I can't bare the pain anymore. Everything is so awful. I understand the anti-natalist position and am at least glad I didn't procreate, that I didn't create beings who could feel this sort of pain. I am in constant grief for the semi-normal life I lost. No one believes me.

I am so depressed and sad and just unable to do anything, and I have to work, and the second I stop working I am totally fucked. I asked family if I could move in with them because I am having a hard time and 1 person said no and the other said ""Sure, but we'd have to talk about it"" and when I asked when we could talk about it, they said ""Oh some other time."" I give up, I just fucking give up, fuck this world, everyone is so mean and selfish and fucking evil

If I go on disability, they will drug the fuck out of me and I don't want that. After being involuntarily hospitalized and treated with so much disrespect and humiliation and condescension, I will NEVER be willingly involved in the mental health system again. Going on disability is a deal with a devil in which I can stop working but then I have to go back to the mental health industry, who WILL drug me because I was hospitalized before and tried to end my life before and their solution is always DRUG DRUG DRUG even if they never work. And even when they never work, they just write down you seem better, and then if you tell them they are making you feel worse and you hate the side effects, they will point to their notes and say how you are doing better and even said ""i feel better"" one day last month and that you lack insight the drugs are helping and need more drugs. FUCK THOSE ASSHOLES. I hope they all suffer one day for their financial exploitation of people who are hurting. Being involuntarily hospitalized was hell, I had to say exactly what those fucks wanted or I would have been kept there to endure even worse suffering. ""Oh, this has been so helpful,"" I lied. FUCK YOU ASSHOLES. Anytime they asked me how I felt or my emotions, I lied. I would never bond with my captors, they would never know the real me. I fucking hate those evil pieces of shit.

I think I know how I'll commit suicide. I think even after the me too video no one will care. People will say it's unfortunate but nothing will be done. Absolutely no one fucking cares how much I have suffered. No one cares about me, I am utterly fucked. I am so just so poor and unhappy and can't stop working right now.

I am just suffering so much, I just want it to be over. I wish I came from a supportive family that I could actually rely on.

He attacked me while I was high on drugs. He said he was going to do them too and then didn't. He told me he loved me, cheated on me and lied about things and I told other people. And he invited me out after, and I went out with him again because I liked him and was naive and stupid, then he got me drugged up, and attacked me, and no one cares. No one cares at all, I am just this awful running joke.

If I did go on disability, the amount I would get is so little that I couldn't do anything other than possible eat and sleep. There's no extra money for anything else, and I wouldn't even be able to have my own small place. I would possibly have to share a room.

I have an advanced degree and I am doing work that is barely above high school level because of having been hospitalized and having gaps on my resume due to depression. It's just another humiliation. I should have just fucking killed myself right after it happened. Every minute of work, which barely is enough for rent and food and definitely isn't enough for medical expenses, leaves me absolutely miserable and degraded. The only ""help"" that exists in society comes from religious cults that hate gay people (or love the sinner hate the sin, which is the same fucking thing) and preach a bunch of lies or the mental health industry that will involuntarily drug me and will find some way of taking control away if I dip my toe in the alligator infested pond. NEVER AGAIN, after involuntary treatment, never again will I interact with them at all.

I just want to die. I hate everything so much, everyone is so mean to me always. No one cares, just absolutely no one cares, and the people who ""care"" always want financial exploitation.

sometimes i imagine when i was younger i was kidnapped by aliens and they torture people before eating them because somehow it makes the meat taste better

and they clone me and clone others before doing this, and they torture everyone the exact same way

we're all hooked up to wires in vats to experience misery so we end up tasting better

and i imagine that none of us know, that we all have these simulations of other people being happy, and we're all experiencing the same sort of misery and no one knows it

I made a typo in the previous post. It imbued my face with a sad quality. I look permanently sad now.

I was also quite ugly before it happened anyway and had unusual features. I almost certainly have genetic damage or ""phenotype variance"" based on genetic anomalies.

I haven't made the video exactly. I did make a video describing what happened. I don't know what I'll do about it. I am terribly scared of mental health professionals. There was recently possibly a door to door salesman type person and I wasn't sure if it was a welfare check and it scared the hell out of me. I didn't talk to the person and still don't know who it was.

What was so mean about how this person hurt me is that I was, back then, quite abnormal looking and he initially seduced me with saying he was so into me and saying he really liked me. I was always so lonely and strange and was just so into him. It was this stupid, utterly stupid idea that I could be happy somehow. He knew I was strange looking and seduced me in this mean way intending to be cruel to me, never wanting to be with me. It was brutal and cruel. Everyone thinks he's a nice person. He was so mean, just so utterly mean, and the night he attacked me was horrific. He planned it, I can't prove that it wasn't just sudden and opportunistic and crazy and caused by drugs (he could have been intoxicated), but I really genuinely believe he planned to hurt me that night, that it was plotted.

I am probably going to have to stop writing about this on here. This place is actually a great place for support. I don't know whether i will kill myself or not, but it's nice to have a place where I can just be sad and be myself and not worry about some mental health industry asshole writing things down or locking me up and depriving me of sensory experiences and demanding I take pills that make me shake and twitch just to placate them, because I'm not allowed to be sad and suicidal because ""jebus.""

Do you feel like anything would feel better for you, if there were any chance of a conviction happening? I'm only asking because having been through similar things multiple times throughout my life, I went through the rigamarole of reporting it and it only brought me more stress and not really any peace of mind, although ultimately the first time I was unsuccessful like you and gave up on the criminal justice system entirely following that experience.

Serving justice in a legal setting, I was told, is mainly for the purpose of preventing future victims and crimes, rather than healing any of the inner turmoil inflicted on me by the trauma. Seeing it through that lens did bring me some peace of mind, and perhaps it may for you as well, that just because that person didn't get arrested or face legal consequences doesn't make what happened to you any less real or horrible. Though I know it's incredibly frustrating and disappointing.

What you mentioned about not being taken seriously due to having mental health diagnoses on your record and having credibility questioned is unfortunately true, no matter how ignorant and short sighted that is. I learned that many people conflate any ""mental"" dx with being irrational, an unreliable narrator, and delusional even if whatever issue you're having has absolutely nothing to do with any of those negative traits they're assuming.

It's something I went through as well when I was abused, my credibility was called into question because I was ""mentally ill/suicidal nutjob"" and the older man grooming and abusing me was seen as a stable, reliable beacon of truth even though he had sociopathic traits and admitted he manipulates people, analyzes their personality to figure out how to use and play them, lies, steals, has committed crimes, etc all because he has a fake, charming personality and I'm a weird looking meek autistic girl. People are genuinely just so ignorant and truly have no clue what a ""mental illness"" even is. Others take advantage of our vulnerability for reasons I'll never understand.

I know it's not much comfort, but you're not alone in this. I can relate a lot to your story. I also swore off therapists and psychiatrists due to the treatment making things worse for me and threats of involuntary hospitalisation. Don't they realize that taking away agency from someone, much like an abuser does, only serves to traumatize a person worse and push us in a corner where it's even more difficult to trust others? They have no clue what PTSD is half the time, and just force shit onto people that isn't even officially approved to treat PTSD or other after effects of trauma, then always blame the patient when the treatment that is being given fundamentally isn't designed for people with traumatic stress. They also tried to get me to take antipsychotics for no reason other than, ""we can't think of anything else that would help you chill out.""

I wish people cared more and helped you out. It's disappointing at so many levels. I'm in the exact same boat as you, I have no family or anything like that, and people would always just pretend like that doesn't matter, when it clearly does and is a crucial source of support for so many after going through extreme trauma.

As a common reaction is going to be to report you and imprison you in some vain attempt to permanently prevent you from leaving. I'm more just talking about if you think you should make an attempt to see people One last time before you catch the bus.

I have a long time friend that told me I should shoot him a message and will chill one last time on discord or voice chat before I catch the bus. He's already come to terms with the fact that I might end myself at some random point.

I was going to attempt to meet my mom and my Great uncle and his wife for lunch This morning. I was supposed to meet my mom at the halfway point and we would drive the rest of the way. I texted my mom that I was leaving and driving to meet her And to not leave without me. Unfortunately I was five minutes late and my mom only waited three minutes Before just Randomly taking off. I showed up and she was already gone. My mom's the type of person who legitimately take pleasure in having me show up To an empty parking lot because I was 5 minutes late. My mom's legitimately a psychopath though. She said In the past to me ""she would never tell anyone if she was going to end her life she would just do it"".

I spent this morning acquiring SN and looking into getting what I need to catch the bus sometime soon. It occurred to me That it might have been their last chance to see me. I feel a little bit bad for my great uncle and his wife as they are really sweet people And would have liked to see me one last time. They are both pretty old themselves in their upper 70s and 80s. Every time I've seen them ive always tried to treat every interaction like it might be my last with them.

That it's not really possible for animals, for example, to consider suicide in the way that we understand it, and people who are intellectually disabled (like, stuck in the mind of a baby or toddler) are not able to comprehend it.

Also, there is a theory that our brains have protective factors in place to prevent us from thinking about our own deaths. Most people don't seriously start contemplating the fact that they will die until they are very old, practically on the verge of it. Some never do, and are surprised and beg and plead for their lives on their death beds, even if they are of a natural age for death.

So actually, I think being able to conceptualize one's own death, and to make the choice to bring it on of one's own accord, takes a certain amount of awareness and agency over one's own life that is NOT in any way indicative of low levels of consciousness or a ""life happens to me"" attitude.

There is no greater form of attachment than your own body. Some dude at the highest level of self actualization might not have gone through the mental gymnastics of realizing that some day he's going to die and just puts it off. Some people don't deal with death until much Later in their life.

Most normally think it's dark and morbid to think about death and that it's in your best interest to pretend it doesn't exist and to put it off. They self delude themselves into thinking they will never have to deal with it or it's so far off why bother. A lot of people who are suicidal deal with their attachment to life much earlier I suppose. Even if you never actually end up taking your own life and self deleting You still end up with beneficial self actualization psychology. Lack of attachment is a good thing it can help you be at peace and think clearly.

After lot of research i reached the conclusion that partial, if done correctly can give desired results in short time. So, i'll be trying partial. Read a few the mega threads, collected a lot of info from there.

Here's what I found:
The noose placement (slightly under the Adam's apple where Carotid's impulse can be felt easily),
Type of ligature (Soft Cotton Bondage Rope, as thick as a normal finger),
Type of knot (slip knot),
Lubricating the ligature with soap (for less friction and good tightening),
Pair of socks (needed to put them against your carotid arteries to achieve the needed pressure because the rope alone can't easily reach there),
A really good anchor point which can hold my weight easily (I am around 90 Kgs, there's a really strong metal bar/frame in my bathroom at enough height)
Knees should be hovering above the ground (for the gravity and body weight to do their part)

Here are my queries:
Is there anything else that I am missing?
Is there anything that I can add to this to make my Partial CTB attempt more efficient?
Is there any way I can increase my chances in first attempt of my partial?

Rig it all up in a way that you can get out if needed, then try to just make yourself dizzy. Do this a few times. Then go a bit further and try to get your vision to tunnel. Then see if you can get yourself to pass out.

I did this myself and by the time I was ready, it was all just a routine. I wasn't scared and I knew the steps. Alas I couldn't practice what a lethal dose of a drug is so it didn't work for me. I've since switched methods and I'm doing the same to get ready for a full suspension.",,,,,,,,

,2475403,mehdone,"Apr 21, 2024 at 12:39 AM","I had a failed ctb attempt with partial.
The only reason it failed was because I didn't use a slip knot, I tied a loop, using two ties- and my body seized in just the right way to slip my head out of it.

It is not difficult to make one's self pass out from this method- it's a matter of positioning one's self on your knees, so that the weight of your upper body is on the thing- and then leaning/pressing down into it. I was out in seconds.

I wish I didn't know how easy it was. It's a struggle for me, because it's so quick that SI doesn't really have a chance to kick in.

Something important to be aware of- I haven't felt right since that failed attempt. I essentially gave myself a stroke for I don't know how long- I don't know how long I was partially hanging. Since then, I have had elevated blood pressure, high pulse rate, and just not felt right. Failure means damage when we are cutting off blood flow to our brain.

Socks aren't necessary. One just needs to lean into it and mean it.
Your body will seize, and thrash around. This method cannot be reliably done with others in the house- they may hear it.",,,,,,,,

You are absolutely correct, doing partial while others in the house is a really bad idea. Therefore I am waiting for the summer holidays, when I'll be alone in the house.
I will be sure to tie my slip knot properly, so that my head don't slip out.
My main concern is ""not getting unconscious"". I have read many threads on this forum that people are finding it very difficult to get themselves unconscious in partial. Even after multiple attempts, many people have been unsuccessfully. Am afraid that same can happen to me.
Although thank you very much for sharing your experience. It was really helpful.",2475403,,,,,,,

I got on my knees, with my body leaning away from the door- I let my body weight push down against the thing around my neck, and I ""pushed"" down against it. Basically, I used my feet against the door and pushed away. I was at a lower angle to the ground. I was out before I knew what was happening- everything faded to black so quick. Seconds.

Don't do this unless you are damn sure you want to die. Had I been in the right mindset to tie a proper slip knot, I absolutely would not be alive right now.

Yes, lower placement on the neck is more ideal- those arteries are closer to the surface there. Bringing one's chin down towards their chest is also helpful- if the head is up, those arteries will be under more muscle and potentially harder to constrict.

There's a learning curve for those that aren't tech savvy. There's a system for rating sellers for reliability and quality in the popular markets. There's a lot of documentation of fent's lethality. People taking a single toke of a blue and dying so to me it's a considerable option. Patches from the darkweb seem like a good option as I don't think they are bootlegged so you're almost guaranteed purity and dose. . I would not go for street fent due to the tranq now being put in it though.

Also, ""death by meth"" per Kurt Cobain is not a typical way to die either intentionally or unintentionally. He may have been early in his using and being edgy when he said that.

i feel like i can't afford to die right now because there's things i still want to wait out on before i try taking my leave again, but i genuinely cannot live in the household i'm in currently and nobody takes me seriously when i say i need to move out and to go back to where i previously lived (it's not the best either, but it's my only option rn)

i can't stand to live here any longer because my sa'er is also here and acts perfectly fine everyday, while i'm constantly terrified of being alone with him even, and seeing how nicely he interacts with biological relatives of mine makes me feel so weak. i'm terrified of opening up and not being believed so if i did speak up on what he did to me it would only be after i've escaped this place

If you want to live, at least for now, attempting a psuedo-suicide-attempt is really risky and dangerous. Serious attempts can always go wrong or they don't seem serious. There is no way to attempt a realistic suicide without incurring huge risk. It seems like there is likely an easier way to deal with this.

If you are placed there for care as a dependent adult (hopefully you are not under 18 because you shouldn't be here if you are), why can't you just tell whoever is managing you that ""someone"" in the house did something that's inappropriate sexually and you don't feel safe there and don't wish to discuss it further because it's traumatic and if they push they aren't respecting your boundaries?

You could also say something like ""someone grabbed my ass when I was looking in the linen closet for something to get out. I didn't turn around because I was terrified and then they walked away, I didn't turn around since I was terrified and didn't move for a minute or two after, then immediately left and went on a walk, i am terrified to keep staying here"" if you absolutely don't want to report being victimized. But if you are a dependent adult and they are a mandatory reporter, even this could get reported to police. You could always say the same thing to the police to get out of there, but then if you ever want to report the actual incident to police any sort of half-truths or distortions that you report now could make that harder. The mental health industry doesn't really respect people's boundaries, they just follow rules as they are told regardless of the affects on others, so you may want to research what rules apply in your area to determine if anything you share with a manager or conservator must be reported because of mandatory reporting laws. The only problem with that is that it's a lie so if you do want to later report what happened, it makes things confusing and you would potentially not be believed. Also, if you're a bad liar, it may come across as a lie.

There are sexual assault hotlines to talk with someone, and they may or may not be mandatory reporters so just research it beforehand. If you can call a sexual assault hotline and can determine beforehand they aren't mandatory reporters, they are more experienced and will be able to discuss better options possibly.",,,,,,,,

I simply didn't understand what was so bad he reacted that way and I wasn't affected by it. Neither were his parents. I don't know how old you are…but there could be a better way to get out of there with proof, without putting yourself at risk to get a reaction that likely won't have the affect you're after.

If you are seen as doing it for attention (and it will be…..because you are) people will just judge you as having weak character.

Consider setting up your voice recorder or video on your phone when it's the two of you. Don't go through anything to get proof unless you're mentally capable of it but it is a smart idea. They wont suspect it. Then go immediately to the police. Your family might let you down.

I will be honest, I've put every amount of effort I can into this existence and there has been some good and some bad but everything I've been through has just killed me inside, a slow emotional death if you will.

I used to believe that things would get better but at this point I realize that just isn't going to happen and I'm tired of lying to myself.

I failed a 6 year relationship and a 7 year marriage due to being overly aloof and content with a simple life and didn't even notice that anything was wrong until it was too late.

Yes, I am a good looking guy, probably a solid 7/10 but I was just far too happy doing too little. I worked, kept the house up, never was unfaithful, was a good listener (but not good enough apparently) and when I married my ex-wife I meant it when I said ""I do"" and envisioned growing old with her.

When she left to ""find herself"" and found another man it was basically the nail in the coffin for me, we tried to work things out after her fling failed and he cheated on her but at that point she gave me an ultimatum where I had ONE chance and I blew it when her friend and I got into a fight after he confronted me for not being good enough.

Yeah, I'm not rich by any means whatsoever but I don't get why I need to make a lot of money to be ""good enough"".

We got a divorce and I've tried dating since this past year but every relationship has failed on the first date because I'm just so apathetic that I'm incapable of even talking to people anymore without going full-on nihilist.

I lack any sort of happiness and I honestly can't even feel sadness anymore either. I'm just the walking dead and even though I try to remember what it was like to be alive I just can't fathom it anymore.

It's as if my ""soul"" left years ago and whatever is left is nothing but an empty shell. I want nothing more than to experience true nothingness. I have memories of being happy and knowing that I will never feel them again is akin to being a horse and having a carrot dangled in front of me while I exist but never getting it.

I know it's ""wrong"" to say this by societal standards but the only thing that even brings me any form of happiness is knowing that there is an end. Most people, when asked what they desire most is eternal life but to me that sounds like the worst form of torture imaginable.

I know that my kidneys are likely failing due to many years of heavy drinking (I'm now sober as drinking does nothing for me) so that brings me some comfort as I don't go to any doctor in fear of saying the wrong things and being institutionalized and this being rendered incapable of CTB on my own terms.

But I just wish I could flip a switch and end it now. Yeah, I could slash my wrists and neck but I want my ending to be in the same vein as my life. A slow death where I just fade away until there is nothing left.

I'm actually crying tears of joy just imagining it, witnessing everything from the good to the bad and everything in-between while the curtain closes on the story of my life.

I'm tempted to just record a multi-hour audiobook the day I receive my poison in a week or two while smoking my favorite brand of cigarettes and posting it online prior to a video showcasing my timely end

Just include the majority of the events that shaped me into the person I was and how I felt at the time and afterwards.

Just include everything honestly, even the bad and not omitting anything. The funny thing is, I can honestly say that I've never really been a bad person and can count the skeletons in my closet on one hand and yet here we are.

I'm 34 and alone and pretty soon my aging parents won't be around either, I can say that I have loved everything they have done for me with no reservations and I would be putting it lightly.

My parents know that I'm miserable and I know that it kills them inside because there is only so much they can do about it. I've told them I no longer want to be alive on multiple occasions over the past decade and after putting forth effort after effort they've come to terms with the fact that I'll likely be dead before they are. They don't enjoy knowing this but that's just how it's going to be.

Because life isn't meant for people like me who wore their heart on their sleeve and gave everything to others until there was nothing left to give. Eventually you reach a point of no return and no amount of therapy or medications even have an effect.

You can't ""fix"" a person who has been completely destroyed to the point that they forgot who they even are. Yes, they have memories but they don't feel like my own anymore because they aren't. The old me died years ago and I've came to terms with that.

Yeah, I am good at talking and have been through a lot in my life despite only being 34 but I feel death creeping closer and closer everyday and it fills me with so much joy that if the entity is real I'd likely cry tears of joy if it appeared, embrace it, and take its hand on the journey to oblivion.

Yeah, I'd have some reservations about leaving the handful of people I care about behind but I believe they'd be happy for me after the mourning process because they've known what I once was and who I am now.

I'm honestly feeling joy right now and my pillow is soaked in tears because I know that the end of my story is such a relatively short time away, I only have a month to go at the latest and I will finally be free and able to feel true peace for the first time in many years.

It's just a good feeling knowing that the human condition as it pertains to me can be cured in such a short time.

Yeah, I would have loved to have met a woman who was going through what I have been going through, get married and just be there through thick and thin and sharing how we feel together but after dating over 30+ women in my life I've came to the conclusion that love was never in the cards for me and I'm okay with that.


Love is sadly conditional whether we believe it to be such or not it seems, there is always some eventual ultimatum, then a harsher one, etc that arises given enough time and then after you inevitably fail once you have a single card left in the deck your left worse off than before.

I'm not religious but if there is some ""God"" or ""God(s), aliens, entities, etc that program us they seem to employ a sadistic sense of humor and have a particular fondness for melancholy in reference to their handiwork.

And don't worry, if I do meet them in some form or another I'll be certain to call them out for all of us, not like it matters to egomaniacal beings of course but I digress.

So I guess you can say I lost the will to live but in losing such I've gained the will to die and shed my humanity and all such entails for whatever comes next (if anything).

I'd prefer nothingness though, I know that may be selfish but the eternal peace of not existing sounds to good to be true yet I sure hope such is the case.

I apologize for the long post, I just felt the need to express the joy I feel when it comes to finally being on the final chapter of my life. It's been a long road and I can honestly say that I'm more excited for attaining SN than I've been for anything else in my life up to this point.",,,,,,,,

If I were a wizard in the Harry Potter world I think I would try to dedicate my life to finding a way to optimize production of the Felix Felicis, aka Liquid Luck. This very concoction kind of destroys any illusion that the Harry Potter world makes any sense because like, come on. It's a potion that makes you instantly lucky. Why didn't Voldemort just use these to win all the time? Or anyone for that matter?

Some known drawbacks to this potion off the top of my head:

-Most if not all the ingredients are extremely rare
-The potion takes many months to brew and even then you only get a small dose that only lasts for a short while
-Doesn't guarantee success, but at least you could still have failure turn out luckily for you
-Drinking too much of the potion is apparently toxic

With that last point in mind, that gives me even more incentive to keep taking as much of the potion as I can have for the rest of my life knowing it will shorten my lifespan. This way I can practically guarantee the rest of my life will be perfect and end on a high note as well. It's probably the best CTB method because it ensures you'll get to maximize the amount of enjoyment and fun you can have before you die.

As for its production being difficult, that's such an asspull too. Plenty of difficult to produce substances are made widely available all the time. Surely a team of wizards could find a way to put their heads together and figure out the secret. If not right away, they could always use the time turner to extend their lifespans somehow anyway. If the human species can find a way to make toxic pufferfish edible in spite of their deadly neurotoxins or if we can figure out how to put the truffle flavoring into everything even though the truffle species itself is going extinct then surely we can figure out how to make this potion more accessible. Then again though this is probably not a secret to be shared with everyone so maybe I'd just keep it to myself and some close wizard and witch buddies.",,,,,,,,

I appreciate your enthusiasm and future goals as a wizard and student of Hogwarts (suicidal edition)! I would refrain from diagnosing yourself into a house just yet, as I will be giving a description of each house shortly. This is no pottermore, this is potterless. We only use rigorously statistically accurate and proven diagnostic criteria, not some wishywashy online quiz.
I'm glad you enjoyed it, unfortunately it only gets worse from here





Before I give descriptions of each house, I should give a quick disclaimer: this is satire guys. Please don't take offense. I love you all. Seriously.

Now that that's out of the way, as for me, I'm primarily a Hufflepuff with traits of Slytherin and Ravenclaw. I have way too much anxiety to be a brave griffyndor. Sometimes I feel like one if I mix benzos and alcohol tho.


GRYFFINDOR




Fitting we start with the most famous and beloved house, the Gryffindor's. The most over diagnosed house everybody claims they're apart of but rlly they're just misdiagnosing themselves cus they wanna be the main character. This is the ADHD of Hogwarts houses. Gryffindors are hailed as courageous, daring, and sometimes reckless. These are the wizards that sometimes don't even make it to the hogwart's castle as they ctb by jumping in front of the Hogwart's express train on platform 9 & 3/4 before they even have a chance to arrive. They are known for choosing brutal methods like gun, jumping, cyanide etc. They have the uncanny ability to override the spell of SI without drinking a fifth of vodka. Unfortunately, many Gryffindors fail their attempts due to brash and impulsive methods that don't follow the guide's instructions and often come back permanently brain damaged. Madam Pomfrey at the Hogwarts hospital wing has her hands full with Gryffindors. She does her best to give repairo spells to their injuries, bless her soul, but they still end up often looking like Alostar Moody after their recovery.

Their house idol of course, is none other than Harry Potter. Now Harry Potter is basically like a travelling MAID agent, I mean everybody he meets eventually dies. He's basically the Kenneth Law and the Alejandro Vasquez (aka ""A"" or ""D"") guy that used to send nembutal to ppl on sasu. He's all courageous and well respected and shit, cus hes helped so many people die. He's hailed as the chosen one of suicidal ppl for that reason and ppl made up this whole backstory that he survived the God of Slytherin Philip Nitschke's (aka Voldemort) sarco pod which has a 100% chance of death and came away with some magical scar on his forehead to prove it. Its like dude, your suicidal, u definitely just cut in the shape of a lightning bolt on ur forehead in grade 7 and it scarred over.

His friend Hermione was definitely misdiagnosed by the old and corrupt psychiatrist sorting hat who's always fresh out of an AA meeting and sounds like he smokes 5 packs a day. Hermione's def a ravenclaw and therefore autistic with all her extensive knowledge of the PPH and random biochemical factual nonsense. I mean this girls the encyclopedia of suicide. Ask her about any method and she'll teach you how to execute it perfectly and give you every statistical fact about its history whilst wishing you 'good luck' like some psychopath. You'll probably end up attempting to impulsively OD on tylenol after talking with her though, one can only take so much of that.",2592524,2592683,2592697,,,,,
,2593741,justwannadip,"Jul 12, 2024 at 7:20 AM","RAVENCLAW





This leads us nicely to the next house we have, which of course is Ravenclaw. Now as mentioned, these guys are walking encyclopedia's of suicide. They hold extensive knowledge of methods, and anything you'd need to know about suicide and its history. If you were to pick out a book in the restricted section of the hogwarts library, chances are it was written or at least edited by a ravenclaw. Some famous Ravenclaws are Stan, who of course wrote ""Stan's Guide to SN"", a best seller in the suicidal wizarding world, and Izzy who wrote the ""SN Bible"" and inert gas series.

Ravenclaw's are generally introverted and enjoy reading books over a night out with friends. They often leave long and verbose suicide notes that friends and family tend to stop reading half-way through. They enjoy poetry and are especially obsessed with their goth poet parents Sylvia Plath and Edgar Allan Poe (who of course wrote ""the raven"" as an ode to his house ravenclaw). Their vocabulary is deep and varied, however the most common word spoken by them is ""actchually "". While nerdy yes, they are the glue of Hogwarts, supplying much of the knowledge we have at our disposal today. So don't be a bully to these nerds or I'll kick your ass and steal your lunch money. Bullying isn't cool at Hogwarts.


HUFFLEPUFF





Ok moving on, we have Hufflepuffs. These guys… no one rlly takes them seriously. They had one important character named Cedric Diggory who made an appearance in the Goblet of Nembutal , and he was all handsome n shit so nobody understood why he wanted to die and when he ctb'd his father was crying rlly loud while holding his dead body saying ""my boyyy, my boyyy!"" over and over which was actually wrong cus cedric was privately transgender (common among hufflepuffs who tend to have bpd and issues with identity)((its ok guys remember I'm one too)). Anyways, hufflepuffs, just like their name are super gay (meaning happy ofc), but not happy as in they're actually happy—no they're still very depressed and suicidal, but they have a more positive and objective outlook on life itself. Slytherin's call them pro-life but they're really just objective in the sense that they believe that life can be a beautiful experience for many, just not them.

Due to their traits of fierce loyalty however, they tend to stay loyal to life, an abusive relationship where they're constantly gaslit with the hope that things can get better, but they in fact never do. They're the accounts on sasu that disappear for 7 months and everyone thinks they ctb'd but rlly they were just trying to recover until someone broke off a 1 month relationship with them and they now wanna die again. Many of them exist in the recovery section of sasu—if one travels to the sasu universe its always recommended to pay the recovery section a visit at least once to see the unique and endangered species of hufflepuff in action. They're beautiful creatures, really.


SLYTHERIN




Finally, we have Slytherin.

Ok these guys are fkn douchebag goth ppl who worship the infamous dark wizard that created the mythical sarco pod, Philip Nitschke (aka Voldemort), even tho none of them have actually ever seen one let alone used it. They're the ones that linger and say they're suicidal and how much they hate life and this planet is a toxic wasteland of pro-life losers yadayada, and yet they don't kill themselves. They're supreme anti-natalists, often fuelled by sexual frustration, and reject any other perspective that doesn't match that. They believe they're like the supreme race of suicidal ppl, which jesus christ, this is how far gone we are. But ya, they just vent all the time but never die cus they say they're waiting for their saviour philip nitsche to fall from the heavens of Netherlandia and bless them all with individual sarco pods. And yes to them its all the stupid pro-lifers fault that this isn't a reality. Basically they're the scientologists of Hogwarts.

Now Philip Nitschke (Voldemort), who was primarily Slytherin but also had some Ravenclaw in him (he wrote the PPH), was a very interesting and notable character in the wizarding world. He was a wizard that had antisocial personality traits, and practiced dark magic from a young age. He was an intelligent boy, though he was outcasted, neglected and mistreated in his childhood, and quickly became a homicidal and resentful wizard. He went on a killing spree, mass murdering tons of innocent wizards with rage. For the longest time he used forbidden spells like the killing spell ""avada cadavra"", and torturing spells like ""crucio"". This soon became boring to him though; he wanted something more futuristic. That's when he created the enchanted sarco pod and formed a group called ""exit international"" aka the death eaters—an exclusive club of 50+ year olds that get new versions of the PPH for the price of giving their soul to Philip Nitschke, which in turn gives him his powers.

Confused? Idk so am I, ask a ravenclaw.




Some background lore on Hogwarts, and the feud between Harry Potter and Voldemort.



Ever since the creation of the wizarding school ""Hogwarts"", originally a noble, healthy and optimistic school of wizarding and witchcraft that slowly became overrun by suicidal wizards after the legacy of Harry Potter traveled around, the school has become a threat to life itself; while simultaneously being an antidote to the immense fear and power that the God of death himself, Philip Nitsche (Voldemort), holds. And after the eventual suicide of Headmaster Dumbledore by hanging after he became so depressed trying to stop the growth of suicidal students at Hogwarts, an underground club named SASU gained prominence in the castle walls.
Voldemort has long seeked to end this movement, by destroying hogwarts and all that are suicidal.

He has one big problem though…how do you kill somebody that wants to die?
Now of course technically killing someone that wants to die is still killing them, but since the victim wants it, it becomes more like MAID or assisted death, which Voldemort was quoted as saying ""is really really lame"".

Now the reason Voldemort hates Harry Potter so much is because Harry, according to legend, was the only one known to survive his infamous sarco pod, since his desire to die blocked the killing spell on the sarco pod, and created a rift between life and death, an almost limbo if you will, which many suicidal ppl experience today (being alive but feeling like you're dying everyday).
Thats when Voldemort realized what many new suicidal ppl unfortunately come to understand: its a lot harder to kill yourself when you actually want to die. So Harry Potter was hailed the chosen one of suicide, Voldemort was humiliated and now seeks revenge and blah blah blah u know the rest.",,,,,,,,

,2589238,Ash,"Jul 8, 2024 at 5:46 AM","I've had part time minimum wage jobs I enjoyed because of my colleagues and what the money allowed me to do with the rest of my time (sixth form and the usual socialising and then the rest of my education and even more socialising) and later on, running a smallholding which paid for itself but not pesky things like my rent and bills. In between I had a career that I loved but was unable to pursue any further as I didn't want to live in London or any major city, so pursued a different path and discovered that I really hated it and myself. Hence the smallholding and a return to minimum wage jobs. Then my mental health deteriorated because I and everyone around me had been ignoring the warning signs since childhood and I've ended up here.

But there we go. Highs and lows. Genuinely great memories. Some I'd rather not dwell on. Big regrets on my part. A lot I'd change to improve life for workers and society in general because I am a socialist and greed does disgust me. As does the feeling that some people get to take but never put back (health and some personal situations excepted). But every living creature ""works"" in one form or another, whether it's filtering nutrients from seawater or gathering food while it's available and hibernating in winter or hunting prey year round or Emperor penguins continually swapping shifts with its mate in Antarctica to create and then guard the egg and then feed the chick until it's ready to fend for itself. That we changed hunting and gathering to something specialised the way some animals like some bees and ants and termites have doesn't make us better or worse, IMHO. Yes, we need to severely crack down on greed and unfair work and trade practices and genuine slavery and ensure people have a fair wage and good housing and access to education and healthcare and utilities and resources and reduce the differences and life opportunities and outcomes between being born in Mayfair, Malaysia and Madagascar. But I believe that with each generation, we move a step closer to doing so. Maybe I'm naive. But to bring it back to the notion of work, when I got my first job, here in the UK we didn't have a national minimum wage. The Tories told us that society would collapse overnight if it was introduced. Well it was introduced and overnight my single parent family's incomes (mine and my mother's) both doubled. We had a roast dinner with all the trimmings the first Sunday after the first payday on the new national minimum wage because it was the first time in fuck knows how long we could afford something so luxurious after years of buying whatever was left on the 10p shelves or whatever crap was offer that didn't taste anything like the name implied. Now the NMW isn't considered good enough and even the idea of a ""living wage"" is old hat. So I might be naive but I do believe in the good of people as well as the bad. I've seen both. We're all capable of both. True good and evil only exists in fairy tales and John Wayne films.

Just my two pence worth, FWIW.

(Disclaimer. I'm currently signed off work due to my mental health. If I could rely on myself to cope with work and a work environment and learning the skills to cope with a new job and do it how ever many hours a week, then yes, I'd go back.

Self-reported life satisfaction differs widely between people and between countries. What explains these differences?

Statistically 1 in 4 men is a narcissistic pervert, so there are a lot of women (mainly) who have big problems with them, without being suicidal. There are a lot of groups on FB for women and we can see what's happening in people's lives, without them becoming suicidal....

Apart from that people have a lot of problems with children, there are also a lot of sick children etc...
Those who cannot find a soul mate, or love etc. .. In short, many things that prevent you from being happy or satisfied. Without them going to this forum....

I have friends who have incredible lives, top managers in super exciting jobs or intellectuals, I can say that they are not necessarily happy. They have (full) fun times. But to the question if they are happy, they would answer no.

But it is above all lucidity about life that allows them to have a good life. I think that's really the key, lucidity instead of pessimism.

I think that it is precisely the search for happiness that is imposed on us everywhere that harms people. If everyone was ok with the fact that there are good times and bad times, and that's just it, people would feel less unhappy sometimes :-)

,2594932,Not A Fan,"Jul 13, 2024 at 10:38 AM","I do. A lot, actually... and that's sort of the problem. I'm terrible at math but this is a simple one:

There are 168 hours in a week.
You'll spend about 50 of those hours sleeping.
So 118 Waking hours if you never sleep in.

A person typically spends 9 hours at work (including unpaid breaks) and a commute of 1 hour each way is typical.
So roughly an 11-hour commitment, times 5 working days = 55 hours (much more than the ""40 hours per week"" often described!)
This leaves a remainder of 64 hours per week at most; many salaried workers and others work hours above the minimum, so in practicality it is often lower.

Most people don't have servants, so a significant portion of that time goes to buying and preparing meals, laundry, cleaning. In addition to miscellaneous other housekeeping tasks and maintenance, doctors appointments, exercise routines etc. 10 - 15 hours per week.

Next are perhaps personal obligations, such as time spent with a spouse, parents, children or romantic partner. Most people require such connections and devoting time to them is not negotiable. If one wants to maintain friendships beyond these immediate relations, that will involve a similar time investment. 20 - 30 hours per week.

This means that, practically speaking, the average worker has less only around 20 hours per week left to devote to other activities such as intellectual or artistic pursuits. If one is willing to sacrifice from one these other essential categories, that number could potentially be increased, but at a great cost.

Some (very few) people manage to align their creative passions with their financial benefit but a simple matter of supply and demand ensures they will be always be the exception rather than the rule. If someone has to be forcibly separated from the activities which give their life meaning, then they may just decide that continued survival isn't worth the trouble. While I'm sure this is not the case for everyone, it definitely is for some (including myself.)

,2564950,Maggiemags,"Jun 18, 2024 at 5:45 AM",I was wondering if anyone more technically inclined know how the molecular weight of KN affects purity testing. My initial idea was just to use 6g instead of 5 in the test but im unsure. I could also just expect the final result to be lower? Or will using 5g of either with the nitrite kit be the same? I know SN 69:85 KN so it takes like 1.23X higher dose but there isnt a testing guide for it. I just wanted to be sure but it should still kill me even at lower doses anyways with a 2xLD50 adjustment instead of the standard 31G.,,,,,,,,

I then took 1ml in a syringe from the cup with 5.96g and transferred it into another 500ml cup of water. I used distilled water. I used 5.96g because the molecular weight is lighter than SN and this test was recommended with 5g of SN.

It appears I still have the proper concentration of NO2 approx 10mg/ml that would be expected with the SN test method.",,,,,,,,

,2593948,hettyratty,"Jul 12, 2024 at 11:53 AM","After a lot of reading, scrolling, and otherwise mulling, I've decided SN is the right way for me to CTB. I'm in the UK, so firearms aren't really an option (would be my go-to if they were), my bedroom doesn't have anywhere for partial suspension (I live in a shared house, so my bedroom is the only private area), and I fear my SI would kick in before I could achieve a full suspension or jump/fall from height.

But now I need to actually plan it. Gather the supplies, and decide on where I want to go out. I will do further research, but I'd like to ask for input, too.

Firstly, the materials. The SN Bible says SN can be purchased from Amazon, but I could only find Nitrate, not Nitrite, despite searching for the latter. Another site was only accessible to companies, so that's out too. Does anyone know of a way to source it? I'm not overly wealthy, but I can fork out a little more for shipping. I have absolutely no knowledge of the dark web or anything like that. As for the antiemetic - I have a history of migraines. I am assuming I could go to a pharmacy (preferable, as I don't currently have a GP, but I can register if necessary) and describe migraine and nausea symptoms and hope to get them? If not, is there any other way?

Secondly, choosing the location. As I said, I live in a shared house, but I don't know or talk to any of the other tenants. They would not interrupt me, and would be unlikely to find me until either the tenancy ends, around September, or if and when the smell got bad enough for them to notice. This is not ideal. Finding anyone who has passed would be traumatic, but to also find someone who has been gone for a while seems like an unfair burden to put on them. So, what then? I know passing can take a while with SN, but I would likely be unconscious fairly quickly. I know some people would suggest a hotel. Slightly better, as I could plan for a 2-3 night stay, CTB on the first night, and then allow for additional nights in case I am initially unsuccessful. So long as I have a sign up, no one should come in. But again, I hate the idea of being found by staff who are just trying to make ends meet.

I live near the coast. I'm not entirely sure of the tide schedule, but I was thinking of going under the pier during low tide. There I would pass out, and come high tide, be washed away. That way, no one else is pulled into this. I'd leave notes for relatives, of course. I do not have much family, but there are a few who deserve to know it wasn't their fault. There are more who deserve to know it was, though I don't know yet if I want to give them the satisfaction of knowing they finally killed me, even if not by their own hand. Another thing to mull on. But I would not want those who did try to not know. I figured either leaving them in my room with the address, or posting them on the day I leave and sending them second class so they arrive after I'm gone. I think the former, just in case anything goes wrong.

I have very little to my name. No car, no house. Just some electronics. A nice gaming laptop. I figure my cousin would like it. Do I close my bank accounts in advance? One is overdrawn. I doubt I'd be able to close it while being in debt. I hope that debt doesn't pass on to anyone. If it does pass on, can I designate someone to inherit it? My father could stand to pay for me for once in his life. Heck, maybe I'll take out a credit card and go wild for my last few weeks, if it means he has to pay it back.

Apologies for the ramble. I don't have anyone to talk to about this, or anything really. No one checks in on me. No one would know I was gone until my tenancy was up - I'm meant to be moving back in with my aunt. I'm a grown adult and I can't even hold down a job, a home, a relationship, or a friendship. I lose them all time and time again. I want this to be as seamless as possible. I've suffered enough and I'm taking back control - I want to do it peacefully.",,,,,,,,
,2594594,rj3542,"Jul 13, 2024 at 12:08 AM","Hi there, I'm sorry things are so hard. sourcing SN is the hardest part. I got lucky as the source I used pulled it off the site right after I ordered. Some people are having it sent from Poland or Portugal, but check the threads on UK customs. SN is triggering wellness checks for some people.

There are online MD services that write prescriptions. I got the Rx's for about $60 physician visit fee. The doctor was doing video calls literally from a bedroom. Call took 10 mins.

You have a good chance of being found and rescued under a pier. People have failed in hotel rooms because they crashed around while unconscious and staff came to check.

Debt is passed to spouses but not family members in the US. You could check online for UK law.

I hope this helps some.

,2594859,hettyratty,"Jul 13, 2024 at 9:22 AM","Thanks for this, I will check out some UK-related threads for sources. I figure I can put it under a fake name - since 5 other people live here, and it's the kind of property that gets new tenants each year (it's technically a student house, though I'm not a student), it'd be easy enough to claim a previous tenant misused the address, or someone made a typo, should a wellness check be called. Though, I highly doubt there would be.

The pier is quite far down the beach, and I was planning on going at night, when the beach is pitch black, and sitting under the pier. Unless I'm spotted as I walk down, I should be fine. The beach is usually quiet at night, besides a few drunks from the local clubs. I doubt they'd even notice me, thankfully. I just need to figure out the timing with the tides, to give myself enough time to be unconscious before the water rises. Sort of a fail-safe for the SN: drowning while asleep would be fine too. A hotel would be a second option - there's plenty of shady ones around here, where I doubt they'd come looking even if I was kicking and screaming, if you catch my meaning.

I'll also look into online MDs, if going to a pharmacy doesn't work. I'm sure we have them here, and while the meds aren't OTC, I don't think they're massively regulated either.",2594594,,,,,,,
,2594858,d3j3ct3dl0s3r05,"Jul 13, 2024 at 9:21 AM","eepy so this is written kinda poorly lol:

Was midway through a lovely session of trying to neck myself to freedom last night when I was interrupted and idk I still kinda wish I wasn't but also I'm glad I was. Doing it in a bathroom with no actual letter seems a bit too morbid for my liking. I might try to find someplace remote enough for nobody to find my body, I don't even want it to even be recognised as a suicide. I just want to simply fade to obscurity and cease to exist. It's hard to stay positive when I feel like I'm beginning to regress, especially with how this job has going thus far. Like idek anymore, they say ""third time's a charm"" but I think I'm just cooked in general honestly…third job and it's already going to shit and although I often blame myself for every bad thing that has ever happened to me, even this seems a bit ridiculous. No clue what I've done to warrant being treated like shit and like a burden at work. Like for once I powered through my chronic retardation and tried to force myself to actually put myself out there and actually talk as well as just trying to learn things quickly and never complain but oh boy is it getting difficult. Whilst the work itself can be exhausting, I don't care I love a challenge and feeling like I have a sense of purpose but what I don't love is being made to feel like the most useless person alive by certain shitty managers whom I can't avoid due to my extremely limited availability (basically live somewhere with zero public transport and have to rely on rides). I'd love to just get another job (for what feels like the billionth time at this point) but unfortunately I live in what is pretty much a job desert (significantly worse without a car…gotta love regional areas) but even if it wasn't, who says that job isn't gonna go to shit. I swear wherever I go, people don't like me and I'm just immediately an outcast and honestly there's no point in trying to run away from that anymore…it's time for me to truly accept that due to my god awful childhood (and all the insanely bad developmental consequences + the potential autism thing), I need to self-delete basically to avoid any further suffering. The only future I see for myself at this point is unemployed and in and out of psychiatric wards whilst likely being shit talked by everyone I know and continuing to be the black sheep of the fam or something. Idk I'm just so over it. Idk when I'll disappear but I will soon hopefully. Lie about my whereabouts, get a coach ticket to somewhere remote under a fake name, then disappear forever. I hate feeling like a parasite/burden so leaving this realm of existence forever or something would be really great. I would love to stay alive for certain few people in my life but it's far too painful for me. I need to do this so bad like it's the only way forward like I need to stop cheating fate and just CTB already. My biggest worry however is being sent to a psych ward like those places are godawful…you're made to feel like a criminal just for being suicidal, all of your symptoms basically get dismissed as attention-seeking, none of the staff seem to have a clue about what mental illness really is, forced toxic positivity (and of course if you don't engage, they extend your stay). My last experience left me physically sick (way too many people in one small ward ngl) and traumatised so definitely gonna try to avoid being caught this time. I'm sick of being the mentally ill/unstable person but it's so hard to not be when your childhood consisted of you mainly being beaten and told awful things virtually everyday whilst not being shown any real love. Truthfully I see myself as something to be destroyed. I am forever damaged and will never be like anyone else. My extremely physically and emotionally abusive childhood, prolonged social isolation and long term suicidal ideation mean that I am simply not suited for this world. The only way forward is death.",,,,,,,,

,2593388,devils~advocate,"Jul 11, 2024 at 9:56 PM","One of the main reasons for me. Married twice,....both had infidelity to some extent.

No 1 left our 5 year marriage (7 yrs together total) for someone else that was engaged at that time. From what I could tell, that OP was vulgar, crude, etc. I guess my spouse found them attractive for being that way. I had no idea what was going on at the time.....except one day they told me they didnt want to be married anymore.
No children.

Then I got remarried to someone I thought wouldnt do this to me again.

No 2 went thru fertility treatments in order to have a child and when that didnt work out, they reconnected with someone via Facebook and started an online relationship. They exchanged love letters, photos/videos of them masterbating, etc. I found out about it & moved out. I moved back in after they couldnt pay the house mortgage. My spouse has not seen or talked to my parents in 12 years because of this event. My spouse knows they know...and feels embarrassed to make things right. I know, I know....this alone should have been a reason for me to leave. Im still with this person. No children. Maybe I feel I deserve all this.

So yes, these relationships have played a role in my decision. It proves to me how awful the world is....and that trust for some (like myself) is just an illusion.
If I had a happy relationship life, the idea of ctb would be a far away thought..

The other kind of relationship reason is... that I dont have a child. I could put up with an awful cheating spouse...but a child would have given me a reason to endure as well.",,,,,,,,

I had no privacy there, they exposed so much of me, I felt so degraded when involuntarily hospitalized that I won't reach out to medical professionals now. I didn't share many of the medical effects of being the victim of sexual violence when involuntarily hospitalized because the situation was coercive, just like the sexual violence.

it would be expensive and painful probably to try to correct some of the damage, and I am poor, I don't know what would be covered by insurance, and my interactions with the medical and mental health industry have been too negative and traumatic for me to even want to see if it's possible. I am someone at this point who probably would rather die than interact with the medical and mental health industry again, just because my involuntary stay was actually that bad

with some of the physical damage I have, I wouldn't even want to be in a relationship with my body so damaged

but not being in a relationship at this point is pretty much the main reason, but if my body weren't so damaged and violated, or if i had better family support, or if I could interact with the mental health industry in a way that guaranteed I would never be forced to take medication or held in a rooms with no stimulation and little clothing and bored, then I probably wouldn't be so intent on dying.

If the leak is big enough it could prolong it even further, possibly causing the gas to run out and leaving you grave brain damage.

These mask are fundamental not suited for our needs since they're design to let a small amount of air to enter for safety measures. If the oxygen were to run out in a hospital setting the patient would suffocate, so they designed it to not be completely air tight. The mask are also one size fits all kind, so fitting the mask securely can be an issue.

The whole idea of the inert method is to keep the oxygen level below 5% preferably even lower, using these kinds of mask is already setting you up for failure. Only a tiny airleak is sufficient to raise the oxygen to survivable levels.

But I'm pessimistic (or cautious?) and I believe it's best to always have a plan B. Unfortunately, I don't have access to a large number of methods in my country. No, I can't die by hanging or drowning, it's a sure failure (at least in my case.). If by chance the SN fails and I am conscious, what should I do? Obviously I'll be alone and I still want to die. With my little imagination, all I can think about is cutting some caliber artery and waiting for the hemorrhage to kill me. The question is what is the best place? With easier access and that requires little force? The carotid?
As a person who has already failed a suicide and who has remained conscious (and agonizing) during cardiac arrest, I am very afraid of a second failure. This time, I'm definitely going to die.

,2590746,wanttogetonthebus,"Jul 9, 2024 at 2:14 PM","You don't necessarily need a more violent death. If you want to die more than anything, the only thing that matters is lethality. There are violent and lethal ways to die. There are also violent and non lethal ways to injure yourself. There are peaceful and lethal ways to die. There are also peaceful and nonlethal ways to injure yourself. You can pick a more peaceful option if that is what you prefer that is the same lethality as jumping off the empire state building head first. For example, Sodium Azide has no cure. There are no survivors. You could take it in front of medical professionals and receive immediate treatment but you will still die regardless if it gets into your bloodstream. That means it's essentially 100% lethal. Popular methods like SN and N are also 100% lethal under the condition that they are taken in the proper dosage and you are not discovered because medical attention will thwart your attempts. One of the absolute worst and violent methods to choose is cutting. This usually will fail to kill and there will be a lot of blood and drama. Jumping and reaching terminal velocity and landing headfirst has a 0% survival rate, but how can you ensure you will land headfirst? These are all different things to consider when choosing your method.

They would feel sorry for them and do all they can to ensure they are supported until the end. They would not be made to feel any guilt, shame or responsibility for what's happened to them.

If someone has a chronic illness/condition and can't tolerate it any longer, then they are frowned upon, people get angry with them and make them feel guilty, shame and responsibility for wanting to end their life to end their suffering.

Both situations are completely out of the person's control in terms of what's happened to them, but in each scenario the way others respond to that person is completely different.

Personally, I think a chronic condition that cannot be cured and caused both physically and psychological pain is somewhat even worse than a terminal diagnosis, because there is no end in sight, but yet people have less sympathy and even get angry with the person for wanting to end their suffering.

Just because people who are chronically ill or have conditions that induce long term (maybe even permanent) suffering, does NOT invalidate one's suffering. In fact, I agree with you, it may be even worse suffering from chronic illnesses as they have no end in sight as the person could be suffering for years and decades on end without relief.

This is also why I'd all for expanding the death with dignity and assisted death eligibility to cover those who are non-terminal, but are suffering immensely, which goes for both physical and psychological illnesses.

I would say living with a chronic disabling illness is made much harder by the stigma and misunderstanding of others.

I am battling not only my illness but also the misconceptions of people around me who can't understand that ""a walk in the park"" or ""thinking positive"" Will fix my problems.

They simply can't imagine the pain and suffering one endures.

And then of course there are those who believe that many illnesses are brought on by the sick person themselves.
Blaming the person on their illness.
Assuming that they are weak, don't want to get better etc.

People often can't empathize with something they have not experienced themselves.

,2576775,Beyond_Repair,"Jun 27, 2024 at 1:03 PM","I think that what it comes down to is in the first case, the person is already going to die, against their will. Everyone feels sorry for them, it's seen as tragic and noble, since the general assumption that most people live by is that everyone should want to live as long as possible, and life is great and worth living.

In the second instance, the person is making a decision to end their life, which is seen as extremely taboo because it opens up questions that most people would rather look the other way and never address (I've read a decent amount about this, most people have protective cognitive mechanisms in place that prevent them from even considering suicide as an option, let alone ever condoning or accepting it). It contradicts the assumption that life is always worth living and precious and a gift, that people have drilled into their subconscious. The anger and disdain that results is a form of control that discourages others from possibly making the same decision in the future, to avoid the same contempt of those that have already done so.

I believe that's why many family members of those who CTB will try their best to blame others, chalking it up to an accident or 'losing their mind' or even potential foul play. Because they cannot fathom the idea that the person has made the decision to take their own life. The alternative is acceptance, and most people aren't capable of this when it comes to suicide.

Stigmas exist for the sole purpose of controlling the behavior of the masses. Like the stigma against gay marriage used to exist (and still exists in some places) because it does not lead to the furthering of the human race. The stigma against women choosing to be childfree exists (and with it the stigma against abortion and getting sterilized before having children or without husband's consent) because it goes against the furthering of the human race. We have it imprinted in our DNA to continue the human race (in reality it's our only given 'purpose', biologically speaking), and things that are not conducive to that are seen as taboo by most and thus stigmatized",,,,,,,,
,2577029,Sheisme,"Jun 27, 2024 at 5:14 PM","I see your point but disagree. Terminal means incurable and it will inevitably kill you. Mental illness will not. It isnt finite. You can recover. From a terminal illness there is no hope.
As someone whos attempted and had a family member die of cancer recently, a person with mental illness when they have means to recover and may not do everything it takes to recover, is hard hitting for a terminally ill person who is out of options and doesnt have that choice. E.g coming onto a forum like this is not going to promote recovery in the best way. Its going to keep you locked in the dark because youve found people to relate too who are also in the dark.

It is two different things entirely, one is deadly, the other has the potential to be deadly. Having lived through both, before a person reaches the decision to end their life in my view, like a terminally ill person would, they have to try everything at their disposal to get well especially if the suicidal ideation comes from an emotional response or is situational. If its chronic thats a whole different ball game. Its so complex.",2576677,,,,,,,

I am literally too deformed to live now and I still can't get even one person in my family to actually help me with Pegasos

No one believes I'm as bad as I am even though I'm bedridden and my entire fucking body is deformed I feel like the poster child for assisted euthanasia and I hate everyone for not letting me go when it's literally my right and my choice. I would NEVER do this to any of them. I would literally do whatever it took to help them get there even if this had not happened to me. Why will none of them do the same They refuse to even believe me instead.

If you're in the US and on disability can I DM you one question possibly",,,,,,,,
,2594648,Cress,"Jul 13, 2024 at 2:30 AM","Yeah to be honest even people with terminal illnesses Are not sufficiently offered with a way to CTB. It does happen from time to time and there's countries that have put legislation in place for it to some degree. A lot of the time if you're suffering from a terminal illness the best the hospital staff will offer you is you can refuse food and water and they can give you some drugs to help make you feel more comfortable with the effects of dehydration and hunger and the slow Agonizing death that goes along with it.

It's quite a bit disheartening but the truth is people have a really hard time directly assisting you with ending your life. I'm not sure if you have the impression that if you get diagnosed with the terminal illness then you're automatically approved for Doctor Sanctioned catching the bus But it's rarely in the case. Hopefully someday it'll be the gold standard that everywhere in the world you will be able to have a doctor assist you anytime you're diagnosed with something terminal.

Then after that you can work your way to other conditions like mental health. If you can't convince people at the moment to help CTB someone That's gonna pass away in 6 months it's definitely really difficult to bring someone over to allowing it for mental health issues.

I have heard of a case where a really young girl Was traumatized and she was absolutely certain she didn't want to live anymore and she refused all food and water and the hospital staff offered her stuff to help with the symptoms.",2576677,,,,,,,
,2594677,Forever Sleep,"Jul 13, 2024 at 3:30 AM","I'd agree with you that they are seen as and I suppose fundamentally are different things. Terminal illness will kill you. Chronic illness and mental illness may not. Chronic means doctors have at least agreed the person is intensely suffering presumably. Mental illness- the jury still seems to be out on. But yes, I suppose there's this idea of recovery as a varyingly realistic prospect for some people- even if they are currently suffering.

I also understand and sympathise that a person dying and in pain who actually wants to live may well feel envious I suppose- of anyone who still has enough health to have a shot at life. My Grandma suffered terribly with her health and she would impress upon people how important it is. She was right- of course.

But still, to argue against that- why is it insisted that we must all try at life? Really- the pro-life and suicidal are totally different mindsets. To people who are suicidal, life is an absolute chore and burden a lot of the time. They may well not even have the desire to 'get better.' Regardless of their mental or physical health, they simply don't enjoy life and don't want to participate in it.

I can understand how someone physically incapable of participating in life despite wanting to feels frustrated. Thinking that those that have relatively better health are so privelaged and lucky but- why take it out on that person? They didn't choose their life. They aren't doing anything to that terminally ill person to make them sick. In fact- I reckon- if you asked most people here- they would give their lives to someone who wanted them- if they were able to be released from them and- if that were possible.

I think there's this kind of weird notion that people who aren't that unwell who want to die are selfish. But, who are they being selfish to? It's not like they're stealing health from other people! We all live independently. They just happen to have a perspective that life isn't worth it.

Also, what difference does it make to the terminally ill person if someone with either chronic illness or, no illness whatsoever decides to kill themselves? (If they aren't related to them.) Again, I feel like there's this notion that we all owe one another something. Like some unspoken pledge to try and live, no matter what. Maybe there are some grounds to that- if we have dependants and even just considering how our suicides may upset loved ones.

Were you ever given that guilt trip as a child though: 'Finish your dinner because there are children starving in Africa.' It feels like a similar phrase but, it's weird. How does it affect children in Africa whether children in wealthy countries finish their meals?!!

I guess it's a morale thing with suicide. Like- letting the side down somehow. If people who seem to have less problems in life decide to off themselves, why would someone with far greater problems keep going? It's simply down to choice though- people keep going because they want to or, feel they have to, or they feel trapped here because suicide is scary and risky. Why should they keep going though if it isn't for them anymore?

I really wish pro-lifers would just admit that they insist upon the two following ideas, which- when you really look at them- aren't very reasonable:

-You can't even consider killing yourself. No one can. (Obviously, we can and we do- it is an option and it's one some of us will take.)

If you can't stay alive for you then, you must stay alive for other people. (Is that fair to ask of someone? Especially if they don't have dependants.)",2577029,,,,,,,
,2594679,Cress,"Jul 13, 2024 at 3:37 AM",That's an interesting idea that you have there with suicidal people giving their mind and body up and essentially dying giving their body over to someone who could potentially make better use of it. Someone from the third world would love to take the place of someone in the First World who's suffering from crippling depression. As theoretically If they take over your body you'll be cured of your mental condition. Probably would make a decent plot for a movie someday.,2594677,,,,,,,

,2574491,curiousbeing,"Jun 25, 2024 at 3:03 PM","EDIT: I edited my post for more clarity

According to my researches: So, a ligature ( rope, cord etc) needs to be wrapped once or twice around the neck and quickly knotted. Padding can be used to protect airways. This way, both jugular veins and carotid arteries will be compressed, so there will be no blood into or out of brain. They also say that this should be quick and painless.

When it comes to locating where carotid artery is, I think, it can be easily spotted if I look at my throat in the mirror. Breathing causes it to slowly move. I mean, If I am not wrong, that part of my skin that moves with each breathing should be one of carotid arteries

How do you think?
because there is no blood into or out of head, i shouldn't feel tightening, exploding head, lightheaded sensations. Airways are also protected, so no pain can be felt. This method, if correct, seems ok.

I may use this method.

What makes me worried is that if failed, i may get brain damage, coma etc",,,,,,,,
,2589340,Umua,"Jul 8, 2024 at 7:47 AM","Yes, the part that you see pulsating in the neck is the carotid artery. It's important that you fully block both of them or 80-90% to be unconscious. I heard that padding indeed helps. You have to block the both. Using the padding method may also block the jugular which if blocked may give you a feeling of pressure building in your head but as long as your carotid is blocked, you should pass out within seconds if you hit the right spot.",,,,,,,,

,2594597,msesis,"Jul 13, 2024 at 12:10 AM","I guess I posted some slightly unhinged posts on this forum the past couple of days. I'm sorry about that, and sorry for any misinformation I may have unintentionally spread while trying to discuss things. There was just so much pain and I was looking for a way to hurt myself because I mentally could not contain it. It's even more frustrating when it's impossible to find information online when the initial methods didn't work.

I was posting about wrist cutting and bloodletting, but those are just ways to cope with the pain while I'm still here. It turns out CTB is harder than I'd thought - as have probably a lot of others - and so while I wait to find a method that actually works for me, I have to cope with the pain somehow. A lot of people accuse of ""attention seeking"". By some miracle perhaps it would be nice to receive some help. But it's never guaranteed and sometimes the pain becomes too much. I'm sure many here are cognizant of the logic: pain from living > enjoyment from living, therefore CTB is a logical choice.

I think we don't need to shame people for not ""being serious enough about suicide"" when they look for self-harm advice, because they may be coping to get through the day-to-day, which is something I'm sure a lot of us can relate to. Thank you all for the good information about exsanguination and how it's very unlikely to work. I was aware of that, but was looking for good ways to do so anyways, just temporarily.

Either way, the pain is unbearable. Just, unbearable. There's only so much pain a human vessel can hold and I simply, more than anything, just want it to stop. It's been 6 years. I've given effort. Then effort. Then more. Until I don't see a reason to live anymore. AND. On top of that. The pain is excruciating. I have one desire and it is for it to stop.

I want to CTB. I don't care what people will think about it. I don't care that ""maybe life could get better"". I'm happy, proud, and confident of my choice and *I* understand why, even if the people in my life never will. It doesn't matter. Anything to make it stop. All of it. All of it. Don't tell me there could be other ways. I. Don't. Care. And who exactly would help me with the other ways? No one. In the end, my life, my responsibility, no one will help anything get better. And there is simply too much pain, my energy reserves are at -100000. I fought until I could no longer. Then I fought some more. Then I didn't want to anymore. But I did anyways, because that's the socially acceptable thing to do. I am tired. That... is the biggest understatement I've ever said. I feel like I've died already.

I'm sorry, I got a bit rant-y there at the end. Most of it is directed at the people in my life, not you guys. Either way, I want nothing more than for it all to stop. If someone would be kind enough to share a source with me, I would really appreciate that. Or if anyone wanted to chat more. I'm really ready, so ready to leave. But of course, like many, I'd like to go out in a dignified way. Looking for SN which I only discovered through this site. Thanks for that as well, because I would have gotten so frustrated and probably done something so much less ideal.

Thanks for reading - I really am ready to go. I just need to find a source, or I guess look for another method, but to be honest, SN sounds so good to me. CO would be hard to pull off in my situation and.. I'd like something a little more flexible. Anyway - I would greatly greatly appreciate any help.",,,,,,,,

I just sat at the front of the funeral home not talking to anyone. I had one Random woman walk up to me and said she I looked so sad sitting there and she wanted to talk to me.

This isn't your fault. This has been a long, drawn out war I've waged most my life. I've always been trying to stay one step ahead. I've failed. You saw that when things started to go downhill between us. If I'd been more of a man, more responsible with my mental health, I doubt we would have ever gotten there. Then things got worse. I hit a low that I never escaped from. I'm still there now, in the same depressive episode that started pushing you away two years ago,. that finally drove us apart a year later. I'm sorry, if I had just handled my shit, we would have already started our family. Now... I hope you can forgive me. Thank you, for everything.

I cherish every moment we had. I know I was a good partner in the beginning, and I hope you remember me as that. I know I slipped. I'm sorry. I keep thinking about what could have been. You'll make an amazing mother. I would have loved to be a step-dad, raising your daughter with you sounds like a dream. I think our little mixed family would have been cute.If the stars had aligned, I think we could have made it work, and would have had a wonderful life together I would have loved to be there to help out. (I already wake up randomly in the middle of the night, at least with a kid it would be for good reason.) Besides, I'm sure I could have thought of a list of smart ass responses to the questions I know would come.

You said you didn't want this to be my problem. I would have loved for it to be. You're right though. I know it's not just that... It's also me. I feel like there's still something there, though. I did the math, there's no way you weren't talking to him and I at the same time in March/April. You may have already been pregnant, then. You wouldn't have come back if you didn't miss us though, and I feel like there's more at play. Maybe it's that your friends don't like me, but they never seemed to give a damn about you anyways. Maybe it's something else. I don't know. I know your family loved me, I know you still feel something. I hope you can forgive me for this if I'm right.

If you do ever get this letter, or maybe even when, please know I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt you. I hope I'm wrong, and I never cross your mind. I hope if you ever read this, you're indifferent. I can't handle it anymore though. I've done the lifestyle changes, the medications. I've tried therapy, not that there's ever been a doctor to take me seriously. I guess being a man means it doesn't matter if my mother neglected me at best, or my father physically abused me at worst. I digress, that's for a different letter. This is only the first draft. I'm something for dropping this on you now though, with everything going on. I'll try to wait, I promise. I want you to be stable, so you won't think it's this.

Maybe I'm wrong, and everything will work out for you. Maybe he'll stop. Hopefully you'll have a happy family and a beautiful life. I wish you the best, my love.

,2585980,easypeasy,"Jul 5, 2024 at 7:18 AM","Today I was searching the internet for answers to my question: will the following combination of medicine cause cbt?

2g Cimetidine (Antacid)
500mg of diazepam (I could collect more if needed)
8grams Amitriptilyne (made as a suspension)
100mg Digoxin (made is a suspension)

I came across this piece of info: Amitryptiline Reactions which would suggest I could cbt without SN or N, or which I am unable to obtain either. Id previously thought I needed P'tol.

Anyway, I am wondering two things…. The original outline that I researched a year ago, suggested to use digoxin as a cardiac switch with the Amit, but the above article does not require it. So….i.m wondering…is it better to use digoxin and Amit or omit the Digoxin altogether.

I have attached two screenshots regarding Digoxin use in cbt. The 2nd photo is interesting. It suggests a completed cbt attempt with digoxin, Ondansetron, Amit, Diazepam, Digoxin and Meto. It's the 5th case from the bottom of the table.

The second thing I wonder is if anybody else finds comfort and is relaxed by doing research? I certainly feel less tension when I feel like I'm making progress towards something feasible.

I do not wish to die or encourage others to do so. I do empathaise with others in debilitating pain, as that is what happened to me 6 years ago. And the only reason I am considering my options on cbt.",,,,,,,,

,2594397,Klimpop,"Jul 12, 2024 at 7:25 PM","The issue of high nitrate results along with high nitrite has been solved before. Basically aquarium strips and also bartovation strip react similarly in the case of the presence of high nitrite, then you will also see high nitrate.
Read this thread at the end for the technical explanation :
I tested CCS SN with test strips tonight.
Where did you get that info, that nitrate will be present? I wasn't aware of that. I may test it again, idk. SN is really not my preferred method as I have a very sensitive stomach. Like most here I prefer N. Look at this test result both nitrite and nitrate are high in cup 1 Even in cup 2...

,2594453,Klimpop,"Jul 12, 2024 at 8:18 PM","If you read carefully that thread, toofargone6969 used bartovation strips and had similar results to you with high nitrate.

I quote her from her thread :
""I emailed the manufacturer of the test strips (Bartovation) and here is what they have to say about the nitrate issue:
""Nitrite is detected and analyzed by formation of a red/pink color on the test pad utilizing the Griess reaction chemistry. Nitrate is detected using the same chemistry; however, the Nitrate is first reduced to Nitrite by a reducing agent impregnated in the test pad. The intensity of the color developed is proportional to the amount of nitrite and/or nitrate present.
I ran a little test here in the lab. What I did is I mixed 6.25% sodium nitrite salt into DI water, as you can see below both test pads did react so we believe your reaction is normal.""
I'm not including the photo since it isn't my own but this is good news. High purity SN will still show a result for nitrates as well due to the chemical reaction as stated above. I feel better having received confirmation from someone very knowledgable about chemistry.""

Also it is recommended to use the SN from the lower part of the container as it would be more potent or pure than the surface SN which is in contact with air most often.",,,,,,,,

,2594519,Cress,"Jul 12, 2024 at 10:23 PM","I got an order of SN recently as well and it wasn't sealed properly the salt was literally Leaking all over the floor as I pulled it out of my mailbox. About half of the salt entered into the packaging for shipment and half was in the intended container. I tried to salvage what I could but the seller said they would send me another one So it should just be even more extra SN.

I think you just need to seal the container holding the SN and make the seal as tight as possible and keep it in a cool place aka make sure that it's inside and not exposed to the elements of temperature fluctuation. If mold can grow in the environment like a basement or something it's probably not a good place to store it. If it's strongly sealed and in a proper environment it should last a long time even if it's been opened from what I've heard",,,,,,,,

I can't deal with it. I want to die everytime anything goes even slightly out of plan. I want to stop talking to people. It's so exhausting. I mean it's the college holidays and tomorrow is the last day Ive got planned to see my friends. After than I'm going to cut off stop responding online to everyone who I'm not planned to see during the holidays and just spend as much time alone as possible. That way there's so much less embarrassment and maybe I'll feel better mentally without that constant embarrassment.,,,,,,,,

Do you have a friend you don't feel embarrassed around you could stay in contact with over the holidays? Even just to check up with sometimes.

Is there anyone in your life that you can talk to about how you're feeling friends or family? One of the best things you can do would be to identify the emotions you're feeling and figure out a way to control them.

If you don't have anyone in your life to talk to therapy wouldn't be a bad idea. One of the main purpose they serve is to help socialize people who maybe didn't adapt or feel comfortable enough to be around people in high school.

I have a story to share probably won't be relevant but I thought I would share it. When I was a younger kid around your age I had the stupid idea that I wanted to be able to get angry whenever I wanted. I thought anger came with a bunch of beneficial stuff like additional strength and additional power it's a bit stupid but it's what I went with at the time. I spent a lot of time immersing myself in anger and then withdrawing. Ironically after working on it for a long time I found that I couldn't feel anger unless I wanted to. Anger ended up being one of my most well controlled emotions.",,,,,,,,

Could you fake being sick to get out of going on vacation? I'm not trying to stop you, but you're a lot more likely to only hurt yourself if you don't take at least a few days to plan. And, if that means you'd be home alone while they're away, it might be an easier time to do it

most of the reason i wanted to kill myself back then is still present. i'm horrible at socializing, i don't envision having a fulfilling social life or making any new friends, and i still don't care enough about anything to put any kind of actual effort in. i just have some new reasons now. mainly that i'm experiencing crippling poverty and i don't have any purpose or direction anymore. yay.

I have been in a state of acute grief for years, since my fiancé died.

But despite the pain of grieving him, would I want my memories of him, of us, of everything we shared and everything he brought to my life, erased?

No. Because I was happy and those memories are precious, he enhanced my life, he made me feel things I never thought I'd feel. If I erased those memories, erased him, then much of life as I remember it is simply hollow and painful: same with other close loved ones who have passed.

The pain of grief is testament to the love and the connection. And although it is exceptionally painful, it's proof that there were moments of beauty. There is comfort in those memories even as you hurt for what you don't have anymore.

.. SODIUM NITRITE DEATH PROTOCOLS ..
………………………………………………………….

Dear SS members, I would like to share with you what I have learnt on the Sanctioned Suicide (SS) platform on Sodium Nitrite (SN), what to expect during an SN death and my own plan to Catch The Bus (CTB) with SN. I welcome your comments, feedback and ideas.

Here are the 3 parts I cover in this thread:
1. SN Death Protocols;
2. Description of SN Death;
3. How to Successfully CTB with SN.

….…………………………………………………...…
…..….….. 1. SN Death Protocols ……....…...
…………………………………………………….……

Below are my own CTB protocols for SN. I came up with 2 options. The difference between the 2 options is the availability of drugs. Option #1 is close to what's highlighted in the Peacefull Pill Handbook [cf. 1st document attached]. My preference goes to Option #2 which is a mix of my own knowledge and of Stan's recommendations - but I don't have access to Ondansetron. In Option #2, I tried to come up with an SN protocol that Maximizes Peacefulness to be as close as possible to MAiD (Medical Aid in Dying) standards (such as DDMP, DDMA and DDMAPh). Note that both Option #1 and Option #2 minimize the maximum time to death with the adjunction of Propranolol which enhances the lethality of SN. The expected Average Time to Death is 40 minutes. The expected Maximum Time to Death is 3 hours for Option #1 and 1.5 hours for Option #2. The probability of vomiting is close to zero with Option #2 because of a Symbiotic Antiemetics (AEs) Regimen of Metoclopramide and Ondansetron. Note that if you weight over 100kg (220 pounds), you should increase the SN drink from 25gm to 35gm.

OPTION #1
……………..
Day 1
• 20:00
- 1 X 10mg Metoclopramide
Day 2
• 4:00
- 1 X 10mg Metoclopramide
• 12:00
-1 X 10mg Metoclopramide
• 20:00
- 1 X 10mg Metoclopramide
Day 3
• No food on Day 3, only water
• 4:00
- 1 X 10mg Metoclopramide
• 11:00
- Stop drinking water
• 12:00
- 1 X 1000mg of Paracetamol
• 12:20
- 3 X 10mg Metoclopramide
- Antiacid (with Magnesium Hydroxide)
e.g. 800mg Tagamet (H2 antagonist cimetidine)
• Wait 40 minutes
- During the wait time, dissolve 25gm of Sodium Nitrite in 50-100ml of plain water
- Prepare a second 25gm SN drink (in case vomiting happens)
- Pulverize 20x30mg tablets of Oxazepam (Benzos)
- Pulverize 0.8gm of Propranolol tablets
- Mix Oxazepam tablets with enough water until a drinkable solution is created
- Mix Propranolol in SN drink
• 13:00
- Drink SN + Propranolol in water
- Drink Oxazepam in water
• Lay back

OPTION #2
……………..
Day 1
• 00:00
- 1 X 8mg Ondansetron
Day 2
• 12:00
- 1 X 8mg Ondansetron
• 00:00
- 1 X 8mg Ondansetron
Day 3
• No food on Day 3, only water
• 11:00
- Stop drinking water
- 1 X 8mg Ondansetron
• 12:00
- 1 X 1000mg of Paracetamol
• 12:20
- 3 X 10mg Metoclopramide
- Antiacid (with Magnesium Hydroxide)
e.g. 800mg Tagamet (H2 antagonist cimetidine)
• Wait 40 minutes
- During the wait time, dissolve 25gm of Sodium Nitrite in 50-100ml of plain water
- Prepare a 2nd 25gm SN drink (in case vomiting happens)
- Pulverize 0.5gm Diazepam + 7.5gm Morphine SR* + 1gm Propranolol (Mixture)
- Mix pulverized tablets with enough water until a drinkable solution is created
• 13:00
- Drink SN in water
- Drink Mixture in water
- Lay back

* Note: With Morphine SR, all you have to do is to open the capsules and to pulverize the micro-beads to make them fast release. ""Crushing, chewing, or dissolving slow-release oral morphine capsules can cause rapid release and absorption of a potentially fatal dose of morphine sulfate."" source: https://cpsa.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Slow-release-Oral-Morphine-Updated.pdf
Note also that you can replace Morphine with Fentanyl (as suggested in the PPH book) or Protonitazene.

=> SN Average Time to Death: 40 min
=> SN Maximum Time to Death: 2 hours

………………………………………………….………
…..…… 2. Description of SN Death ………..
………………………………………………….………

There are hypothetical descriptions of SN death experiences on the SS platform. Recently, I read of a hypothetical person who didn't take any antiemetics (AEs) nor benzodiazepines (benzos) nor Propranolol.

That account didn't sound great. Dizzy, nauseous, vomiting, fast heart beat, not knowing how they were feeling when the breath sounds were audible. Once again, she didn't take AEs, nor benzos, nor Propranolol.

I just want to fall into a peaceful sleep and know nothing about it.

…………………………………………………….……
…. 3. How to successfully CTB with SN ….
………………………………………………….………

SUMMARY:
- The most important thing is to drink SN on an empty stomach and to not be rescued.
- It's good to take antiemetics (AEs) because it decreases the risk of vomiting. Note that metoclopramide is not the best AE (because it's a neuroleptic, it's going to make you feel down because it blocks dopamine). Best AEs are prokinetic AEs such as Ondansetron.
- An antacid with magnesium hydroxide is recommended because more SN is absorbed at a faster rate at the beginning of the process (note that vomiting is ok as long as enough SN has already been absorbed and that a second SN glass is available to drink). Indeed, a pre-dose of H2 antagonist cimetidine can increase absorption of SN (e.g. 800mg Tagamet taken 40 minutes before SN drink). [cf. 2nd document attached].
- Propranolol allows you to die faster and have fewer side effects. Stan recommends 800mg. Indeed, the concurrent use of a beta-blocker such as Propranolol enhances the lethality of SN. [cf. 2nd document attached].
- Take 0.6gm of Oxazepam (or 0.5gm of Diazepam) in water right after the SN drink. Benzodiazepines remove anxiety and this large amount will knock you down.

Below is a compilation of relevant quotes:
…………………………………………………………………

« My understanding has always been that if one fasts 4-8 hours prior, uses 25g SN mixed with 50-100ml water, and is not interrupted, then one can expect death in 1-4 hours. I've repeatedly given this advice; if I am in error, I want to know so that I can correct it going forward, and also stop arguing with different advice. »

« The essential component is the SN. Everything else is meant to make the process easier for you and to minimise any possible symptoms and discomfort. […] The second most important step of the method after making the SN drink and swallowing it, is for the SN to stay in your stomach. You are drinking a toxic liquid and your body defences will recognise this and may try to cleanse your body. One of the defence systems is vomiting. (This is followed by a list of antiemetics that will perform as needed, as antinausea medication and some antiemetics will be ineffective.) »

« We know from anecdotal accounts prior to Stan's Guide being posted, as well as after, that antiemetics are not a guarantee that vomiting will not occur, and that vomiting is not a guarantee of method failure. »

« First, the antiemetic is ""suggested"" here, not insisted upon. Techically, I don't see that it is insisted upon in Stan's Guide either but, as I mentioned above, it's confusing. Second, while Stan's Guide said that keeping SN in the stomach is important, the PPH says what is of importance is rapid gut absorption. For this, the PPH recommends fasting and Tagamet, an H2 antagonist (Stan's Guide offers more options). However, neither fasting nor the antagonist is demanded as part of the regimen, while Stan's Guide says that fasting is an essential part of the regimen (not quoted, see link). »

« Keeping the SN in your stomach is the second milestone. To achieve this, you need to take an antiemetic. He's stating that the antiemetic helps you to achieve the second goal, prevention of vomiting. »

« Stan said ""The regime is there to help you to have a higher success rate by not throwing up and lowering stomach acid, it's the SN that kills you.""»

« Stan: Will it hurt?
""There could be some discomfort during the process, it's not a tickling contest. When it comes to physical pain, headaches (low level ones and not splitting migraines), a bit of a stomach ache perhaps. Fast heart rate which is not painful but I can appreciate it could increase anxiety. Laboured breathing as the body works to try and get more oxygen in, again not painful but could increase anxiety. But you may get no symptoms at all. If you have an underlying physical health condition, then nobody knows how you will react. people can't ask other people for a personal prognosis on how they react to SN. I absolutely understand people want to know. Just need to understand what could happen to you as the worse case scenario and then hope for the best. Again, the worse case scenario with SN is far less then many other methods that are as easy as this to do."" »

« Particular types of antacid are a good idea, and may be more helpful than Metoclopramide (Meto) in that they assist the method in working, while Meto tries to stop something from happening but may or may not, depending on the person. »

Stan said: « The purpose of antacid has nothing to do with quicker absorption of SN. In your stomach there is something called gastric juices, one of the components of this juice is hydrochloric acid (HCL). When SN mixes with HCL, it converts to regular salt. There isn't enough HCL in your stomach to convert all of a 15/20/25gm dose, but it will reduce it. Therefore less SN gets passed to the small intestine where the process of actually transferring it into bloodstream starts. The stomach only prepares the food for digestion, it does not absorb it into the bloodstream. So the purpose of antacid is to help reduce that conversion so more SN moves into the small intestine. Can you be successful without antacid - yes. But seeing that it is the most simplest of the medications to get OTC I don't see why you should not. If you can only get a simple solution from your pharmacy, then something is better than nothing. »

« What you need is an Antacid with Magnesium Hydroxide in it. Why do you recommend that one over others? Well there are a number of other alkali that neutralise stomach acid, but this is the most benign on the list and has minimal to no conflict with other medications. It is generally known as Milk of Magnesia. »

Stan said: « Nausea for me regarding SN is such a voodoo subject because there are obvious causes for it such as taste and stomach saying ""no thanks"". But then that does not tally up with medical reports on people passing through accidental exposure. I personally believe the power of the mind is understated when we talk about this. I wish I had a hard, solid scientific answer as I know it is the biggest concern for people, but I don't. people who have taken Meto report vomiting so it is not a guarantee. »

« Now the popular narrative on the forum is that meto is a must, and vomiting is a common cause of method failure (which I said in a comment on this thread I may research anecdotes to either prove it or debunk it). »

« The vast majority of successes did not report redosing. Until recently, the folks who vomited still succeeded as long as they didn't receive medical intervention and as long as they took over 17g with 100ml or less of water. »

« What's been reported in the past is that if someone held the SN down for several minutes, then enough was in their system to succeed unless they were interrupted or sought help. That's been the common narrative for as long as I've been a member, until just recently. »

« No, neither are essential to SN working. An acid reducing agent, even a simple antacid is so ubiquitous, I can't imagine why one wouldn't use them. By far, the most important factor would be to reduce the time in the stomach, as SN is acid liable, and this means fasting and an empty stomach. Various studies have been conducted on transit speed out of the stomach and into the duodenum (where SN is absorbed). The simplest numbers I can give are that for a studied volume, 50% of the liquid is out of the stomach in 10 minutes. Numbers vary slightly depending on volume or osmolality and in studies with radiopaque isotopes, but it's a fair estimate as with an N overdose, individuals will die with N or SN in their stomach, unabsorbed. Said another way, parenteral dosing of either could be much lower than oral dosing. The reason such large doses are given is to ensure speed. Should the dose of SN be reduced? Definitely not, but this is why even with vomiting, people succeed. I'm almost loathe to talk about antiemtics but will highlight a few points. If prokinetic antiemetics are available, then use them. Likewise if Ondansetron is available as well, use it. If only Zofran is available, then use it. Vomiting has both a central and peripheral mechanism, and the seratinergic and dopaminergic antiemetics function at different receptors. The heavy preference for Meto vs Zofran is, in large part, regional|national. I've posted several times on why the advice to test Meto is horrible and should be stopped and won't repeat it here it seems the majority (vast majority?) will vomit with or without antiemetics. Redosing can overcome this. Likewise, I say this is why antiemetics are categorically not ""essential."" Stand guide is generally excellent and was put together to help others. I suspect in part it emparts a sense of control on behalf of those who follow it. Is everything in it essential? Of course not. Some of the items, such as a recommendation to take Ibuprofen or Tylenol likely will have ZERO impact on discomfort or headache. However, if people feel they help, then it is a positive and a benefit to take. Bottom line, the essentials for SN are fasting, SN, and possibly redosing in cases where vomiting occurs very quickly. »

« Stan's point was that if you have the correct amount of poison, an empty stomach and some backup shots in case of vomiting, you will die. However, the correct AE is a great helper to not vomit in the first place. Anything else is for your comfort. »

« I went through all the failed attempts reported on the forum, and there have been none that cited vomiting as the cause of failure. Only one may have been caused by vomiting, but there were other factors that could have been the cause, or a combination of factors. Of 23 cases, the overwhelming cause of failure (16 cases) was getting help or being interrupted. »

,2555282,007Bob,"Jun 10, 2024 at 5:12 AM","Antiacid debate you need it or not:
In 2019, when Stan wrote his guide he used Ppeh as a reference and that year ppeh book recommended to use antiacid.

Basically raising the pH of the stomach (lowering the acidity) decreases the SN converting into Nitric oxide which is a vasodilator that will drop your blood pressure drastically resulting in unconsciousness. This is the main and fastest mechanism that SN knocks you out and antacids can slow this process resulting in you staying conscious longer. Most people think SN knocks you out by lowering oxygen levels in your tissues and yes that would eventually lead to unconsciousness, but the vasodilator effect is much quicker and is why people who take SN can collapse at any time without warning so it's best to be laying down or sitting after you take it.

Recently everything have changed, ppeh book says ""The advantage of lowering stomach acid in order to lessen gastric no production (with the associated drop in blood pressure) vis a which allowing more nitrite to be directly absorbed into blood from the small intestine.""

Therefore, the benefit (in terms of potentiation) of taking an antiacid and proton pump inhibitor (PPI), cannot be established, this is no longer advised.


Conversation in 2022: « ""Hello Dr Nitschke,
Why are anticids no longer recommended for sodium nitrite? Is it because people lose consciousness faster without anticids?"" Dr Nitschke: ""Raising gastric pH might increase the NO2- that moves into the small intestine speeding death, but it decreases the NO production in the stomach and blood pressure drop. No longer a recommendation.""»",2555090,,,,,,,
,2555423,Nettles,"Jun 10, 2024 at 8:16 AM","The latest edition of PPEH mention that the Propranolol isn't a ""luxury"" item but enhances the effect of SN by restricting cardiac output while the brain is trying to compensate the loss of oxygen therefore Propranolol taken with the anti emetics before the SN is effective according to the regime in the PPEH 2024. Though the new dosage is decreased to 400 mg. You can also ""potentiate"" SN by dissolving the Propranolol, but then 2 g, with the SN.

And yes, antacid though debated is no longer recommended.

However Propranolol or beta blockers are mentioned in the regime only ""if available"" and same regards to benzo after consuming the SN. It's the SN that's important.
The following has been observed by firsthand eyewitness after consuming 25 g of SN ""potentiated"" with 2 g of Propranolol;
@3 mins dizzy
@5 mins very drowsy, responsive
@12 mins unconscious
@15 mins deep sleep/ un-rousable
@25 mins increasing cyanosis
@30 mins irregular shallow breathing

,2555530,007Bob,"Jun 10, 2024 at 10:12 AM","I just found a source to have access to Ondansetron. So basically now I have access to 2 SN options to CTB. Can you help me with the pros and cons of each method? I want to make sure that I chose the right SN Protocol to have a Peaceful Death. Can you please share your suggestions and feedback?

Here are the meds used in each option:

……………….
OPTION #1
……………...
AEs: Metoclopramide
1st Drink: 25gm SN + 0.8gm Propranolol
2nd Drink: 0.6gm Oxazepam

…………….…
OPTION #2
……………....
AEs: Metoclopramide, Ondansetron
1st Drink: 25gm SN
2nd Drink: 0.5gm Diazepam + 7.5gm Morphine SR + 1gm Propranolol

Option #1 is close to what's highlighted in the Peacefull Pill Handbook. It's tried and verified method.

In Option #2, I tried to come up with an SN protocol that Maximizes Peacefulness to be as close as possible to MAiD (Medical Aid in Dying) standards (such as DDMP, DDMA and DDMAPh) - but it comes from my creative mind. Option #2 also has 7.5gm Morphine SR: is it necessary? What would be the impact of including 7.5gm of Morphine SR? What do you think of the change of AEs to include Ondansetron? What are your thoughts and suggestions on these 2 options? I am open to come up with a third option that would be the best of all. Thank you in advance to your help on this

* Note that the MAiD (Medical Aid in Dying) protocols such as DDMP calls for 15gm of Morphine.

I honestly know how shit this feels. I used to be a major people pleaser. It takes a lot to change that, but trust me, you can. And you will be so much better off for it - you can be yourself, and everything else just flows, and people stop disrespecting you, because you stop allowing it (boundaries).

No one hates you, it makes you feel this way, understandably, because you're putting everyone else first, but yourself - when you are the most important - don't think for one second it makes you selfish, it really doesn't. You should have boundaries and respect yourself, and don't allow people to treat you however they want. People will respect you more for having boundaries and limits. There are boundaries in all relationships, including marriages - without healthy boundaries, you lose yourself.

Once you put boundaries in place, and show those that matter, how you want to be treated, this will stop. I promise

It's a very gradual process, but you can do it. You have to want to though, and want to not let people shit all over you (it's literally learned behaviour from our carers etc - how you have been treated in the past).

Being alone for 18 years has deeply affected me. I'm tired of fantasizing about friendships since I was 9 years old. It's difficult for me to go to a psychologist; how can they help me if I'm unable to communicate properly?

I'm desperate to make friends. I've joined many online support communities, but I always chicken out and leave immediately. It would be great to have a friendship to chat, spend time playing video games together, share our problems, and receive a hug; it would be very good to have something meaningful in my life. At first, I think, ""Wow! Having a friendship is beautiful,"" but then I think, ""I'm an idiot, I'll never have friends, I want to my life."" I've never received words of appreciation from a friend or someone genuinely interested in friendship or conversation. I don't know what else to do; I'm extremely stupid and shy, both in real life and online. I'm thinking of drawing attention in a morbid way, maybe seriously injuring myself, to receive attention for the first time.

""Oh, you're a melodramatic loser."" You're right; maybe that's why I should die. My text is so contradictory and poorly translated that it makes no sense, just like my whole life. I'm just a fool with the motto ""poor me,"" and I deserve all the humiliations I receive every day for being weird and weak, for not wanting to face even the smallest problems. I have delusions of grandeur for no reason, that's why I'm retarded, since I've never achieved anything and yet I think I'm better. My God, my head is full of shit. We all know that these behaviors end very, very badly. I should avoid it with my death before it becomes worse.

I hate my height of 5 feet 6 inches with myopia, nasal congestion, ASD, DCD. I would have severe social anxiety if it weren't for my depersonalization and my constant fantasies 24/7. I hate living in the lowest part of the third world, with people whose behaviors are deplorable and justified by culture.

I'm a fucking weirdo who reminds you of other fucking weirdos, right?

I hope this thread is not ignored like so many other things in my life because it's cringey. I've always lived in uncertainty, never been told directly to my face. Just tell me what they never told me. Am I in the deepest shit of hell or what? Please, be honest and clear up that doubt for me.

This is the only time I've managed to express what I feel and think. That's why this text is chaotic; all my emotions have exploded here.",,,,,,,,

I know it's really hard to constantly feel like you're the only one that wants a friend/the only one reaching out to people, but eventually if you share your passion someone will respond. It's really hard, but being online if much easier. If you feel insecure or have a hard time communicating you can text people, as you have infinite time to think of your thing. You just got to push past that anxiety(which feels impossible), but just to keep it up. You have to believe life will get better.

I waited. I waited all 2023. I told myself maybe something will change in 2024. Maybe help will arrive. Nothing arrived, no change, continous suffering-physical and psychological. No relief. No support. Nobody cares.

I accidentally deleted what exactly nhs did to me and I will post it further here, in other posts but I am so tired. I want to go sleep forever.

I care about others, always did, so be careful and do not give me any advices-do not put self in legal trouble, although I ultimately will state how I wish to go. NHS has ruined my health, my employment, my friendships. Everything is gone. Everything, everybody, money and criminals walk free, have life, party on my dime
also, I forgot to tick I wish updates to my email-if anybody knows how to do it after posting thread, I will appreciate
I like life. But once i lost job, lost my pet cat, lost friends-nothing is same. New friends did not come, job situation is not that great. Finances-could be always worse, but considering how hard I worked my whole life, if criminals did not happen and were reported couldbe significantly better especially due to my current, high health needs which I can;t fulfil and it fuels suffering.

If it was up to me, if I was financially 'fine, fine' I need, for this month alone around 300 for physiotherapy(and it should be regular, monthly affair), further 80-90 for new crutches, and I need kitchen appliance for chopping veg as my body gave up.",,,,,,,,

Last 30 months has been isolating,lonely and Iam ready to go. NHS kills people. NHS is abuse, terror and negligence. Not help. Not care. Psychiatric abuse, violence, threats, false help promises but in reality lazy staff wanting to make useless, false appointments where ppl are neglected and led to despair.vHighest degrees of violence, abuse, threats and life derailing advices which leave victims without justice and life funds.

I am ready to go. My date is within beginning of September. I have already detailed plan, place. Fault proof although will hurt a bit, maybe even a lot. And just like that, soon, breath will become an air.

I like life. So many dreams I had. Just ordinary, honest and simple ones-like advance in job, study, and travel world. Is sad that due to NHS abuse and negligence it's all coming to the end.

I know my dying will hurt. I know it will be not instant although relatively quick-2-5min according to various sites. I hope alcohol will help, especially, due to fact I am not drinker(one beer sends me to bed), and I hope effects will be stronger with strong %. It will hurt. It scares me but there is no choice.

To fulfil any of goals, is start from scratch. Study-from zero. Carrer start from zero as what I lost is not coming back. To study, due to my conditions, I need medications and pain management which NHS is not providing. Some meds I take will need transfer from private Dr who made diagnoses which is extra costs. NHS is false promises I will see specialist and be referred have been floating for months but no action. Money are running out even for basic life.

I have been doing best to save, earn, not to go into down mode but I can't do it anymore. Do not take me wrong.

I can still achieve things. It's just matter of NHS if I get help they have been promising whilst allowing criminals rob me I'd broad day. If I had money, Would be different.


So if Theoretically, I were to spend, as of today:
3600£ annually for physiotherapy
Further 700-800£ on equipment
And NHS does nothing like in past and my earning capacity due their bad actions already decreased by 25-40% and nothing is same, and for any education is costs more, how do I maintain it?

Not to mention I am not eating enough, and not healthy and I still feel like breaking bank, and income is not enough, I pay transport everywhere despite living locally to job as I am unable to walk 1bus stop worth and in past, my health crashed many times, and I know it will crash again and I must have back up bcuz no back up-what? Street and nothing else. I have no family and no help to rely on.
I am trying apply again benefits, and help but I can't even sit at desk today due to pain, to read and fill forms. Pain eats me. I have tight chest from anxiety, level of worries, heart pain( including kind of sharp chest pains) and is like..

I want to give up. I met recently somebody, And seeing this person makes me happy although I do not have high hopes for mutual future. But seeing this person, makes me so happy and yet, even that seems not be enough to want stay around.

,2587304,shinigami_1992,"Jul 6, 2024 at 1:48 PM","I have some savings, but in what my current situation is-layered build up of issues due to:
-medical negligence&lack of basic healthcare and lack of official diagnoses despite conditions being there for years
-me being victim of criminals and me being vulnerable and system failing to provide take care of me/financially support me

I can't see getting up financially. I mean, for what my condition became due to bad/lack of treatment and failures to operate in timely manner I need:

-immediate pain diagnosis and pain relief(obtaining all of it has been issues, drs refuse to acknowledge severity of pain, fail to change medications, do not want go on injections where I have had for YEARS stomach issues)
-foot surgeries although I do not know how successful now it can be as eg 6-7years ago my condition was not as severe and now, I have both sides hip issues, back issues-they do nothing. They now try suggest one of those conditions where your whole body hurts where pain started after some psychiatric medications.
-i need on ongoing basis private physiotherapy(once a week 70£) and crutches(which is also cost) and shoes replacement regularly as I destroy shoes quickly and do not forget high cost of living-Food, any self care etc.

I think I'd benefit to sit with someone financially and medically savvy to make life/expenses(medical) plan about what I need eg next 5years but there is nobody. Those free places are overworked. I mean now, my new workplace is stepping up to help which is nice but things has been bad for months. Nobody, especially NHS cares. As for savings-they are there(around 1year worth of my annual, low waged worker salary) and for some that would be a lot but:
-my condition is not stable. Is not treated properly. I do not know when, and for how long I will physically crash. When I crashed in 2022 Dr made wrong assumption it was psychological, refuse allow me come back to work, made me fat and not functional and permanently disfigured with medication-just more burden. More issues. Now I need 15,000£ for breast reduction as psychological suffering is immense and I have body dysmorphic disorder.
-life is expensive here. Now, is constant prices hike ups. Shops, bills, rent annually. Now-its somehow controllable/I can make predictions, but due to layer up of bad experiences from past, I can't be living/surviving month to month.

I know some ppl do, but some ppl have support network/family, or means of side income. I have none. I am also not beggar, I do not borrow from ppl as it puts them in duress/ruins things. I was always 'supportive one' and let me tell you-ppl took advantage. I can't sustain worrying for others anymore. Neither I want ask ppl for help as everybody-has own perceptions about own needs, some ppl have too many friends/lose on stupid stuff and later harm victims like me.

I do not know. Let's say, in past things we're not easy. And I had in my account less money than I have now. But I was stronger, and more hopeful about life, job and prospects. Right now, I want cry. I want NHS compensate me for all what criminals did to me, for their abuse and negligence. Tey have been so unreasonable, I became unreasonable too.

I mean, even if I make 'investment plan' to pour let's say half of savings into my health how do I know NHS will successfully treat me know? My condition is ongoing, chronic, lifelong and NHS for long time told me there were solutions, that they were going fix things. It sounded like permanent solution and relief. Only recently they began changing song they sing and blame me for lying to me.

I have been hearing for past few months/weeks I will see rheumatologist. No referrals yet. Nothing. Everything is bad. Imagine you have several health problems and you are not helped adequately.

NHS even for years fail treat my eczema, fail give advices. Then Is chronic pain, physical disability, hormonal issues, now body disfigurement which I will need privately treated(15,000£ at least) as psychological pain and discomfort is unbearable. Hips issues, back issues. In past they coerce me to purchase bikes, tell me is good idea, that cycle will help. I felt so unsafe on bikes. I did not make many trips. Lose 2 bikes, loss 600-700£ or so on 'bike experience'. I need stationary bike but I am scared to buy. Due to domestic abuse, I move houses 15+ times in past, many financial and property and various losses, many affairs not tended, and I fear-buy 21kg stationary bike-how I move it? Hire ppl and pay from where? In past I needed money-I worked more hours
Currently my earning capacity went to being so low, costs soared, and I just do not see it going forward.

I feel so tired, so affected, harassed and harmed by NHS that if they do not act seriously now, do not solve issues, do not fix falsified medical records-Its over. It's so over. I can't carry on longer

Something to consider with any suicide, is to be mindful of how this will effect others. Whether its family who will find out or whoever it is that finds you, somewhere along the line your death will impact another persons life. I'm not sure if you care about that but its something to think about in these moments you want to be your last. Your death will have meaning to someone out there, regardless of who it is. I'd also like to throw in that I, myself, I really don't know what exactly I believe in, in regards to whatever it is that may be outside of humanly life. However, I do think something put us here and that there had to be something before life and something after death. What it is? I am not sure but there's a chance that there is something. Regardless of what that something may be, if countless religions can agree that suicide leads to something ""bad"" in whatever comes next, despite the fact that religions bicker with each other over who is right and wrong about things, perhaps suicide could very well be a negative thing. Whatever you end up doing, I wish you the best and hope you find peace. Just take my words as some food for thought or perhaps nothing at all. Post if things fall through or you need something, even if its just to vent. Good luck, dear stranger.",,,,,,,,

A lot of things happened... and well, they gave me an expulsion order... I have 48 hours to leave the country, in theory, because I plan to stay here a few more weeks and earn some time (and money) to be able to go to my real destiny.

Last Minute Hanging Advice,2591082,dazed.daydreamer,"Jul 9, 2024 at 8:14 PM","I'm gonna CTB by hanging within the next few hours, and I need some advice about method.
I was planning on a complete hanging as it seems more effective (less risk of SI interference), but the best I have in my room is a wardrobe bar that holds my weight, and it is only tall enough for partial. However, I could use my door—I could drape a tapestry over the front to cover the rope (I live in a dorm and don't want to risk someone seeing the rope and getting saved).
I have three questions at this point:
1) Is complete hanging significantly better than partial, enough for me to use the door method? I'm a bit scared of the risk of getting caught during set up, but it shouldn't take too long outside my door, there are only a few people on my hall, and I could do it super late. Also, I have a bottle of liquor I could use to get wasted before partial hanging, to help with SI
2) If partial is a solid option, what knot would I need to use on the wardrobe bar? I have the noose tied, and the rope comes with a loop on the bottom that I could use on the door knob if I go that route. But idk how I should tie it to the bar if I go partial, to make sure it stays secure as long as needed
3) Is slipknot always better? I tried tying both, and had a much easier time choking myself with the hangman's knot. I think it'd work fine, like I can get it tight just beneath my jaw before dropping, but I wanted to check since people claim slipknot is the way to go",,,,,,,,

Last Minute Hanging Advice,2591114,spectraltease,"Jul 9, 2024 at 8:49 PM","The other comment is right, wait till you have everything ready.
For your questions: there is not much difference in the lethality. You just need some kgs pressure on your neck to pass out and die. It doesn't really matter because partial will add enough pressure to your neck, just like complete does.

My opinion:

I would do full hanging because there is simply no way back, if you are one time in the noose.
The most fail if they do partial.

Alcohol is a part for its self. I don't recommend to get drunk and than go hang bacause you can mess up more.

Noose is good. How I said, there will not be as much pressure, so you don't need a fancy knot. There is a knot guide, read it.

Has anyone ever killed themself with a homemade gun?,2594340,Not A Fan,"Jul 12, 2024 at 6:25 PM","Well.. I see what you're trying to say. But it's not like there aren't any welders who live in trailer parks.

It's hard to say what might have gone wrong in your case, but you're not the only one who has reported this problem of the exit bag not working as expected (without ever figuring out exactly why.) Apparently it sounds much easier on paper than in it is in actual practice to get one of these damn bags working properly.

One potential issue could be that argon is heavier than air (whereas nitrogen is lighter). Thus nitrogen will rise in a closed space, while argon will sink; this may lead an issue where you are still breathing air and CO2 because the bag isn't being sufficiently flushed. One possible way to address would be increasing the flow rate on the regulator; some have suggested 25lpm for argon, compared to 15lpm for nitrogen. Consequently this means using up the gas almost 2x as quickly, so a larger tank would be ideal.

I'm much less concerned about the possibility that welding companies would deliberately sell defective argon... this has only ever been reported with helium for balloons (which the added air doesn't affect). So my intuition is that your attempt failed not due to the argon, but to some other factor. If you can check your receipt or packing slip for the cylinder it should state clearly if the contents is 100%argon or if it is a 75%argon/25%CO2 mixture.",2594059,,,,,,,
Attempting this Saturday + my suicide letter and just talking about my life lol,2588729,depthss,"Jul 7, 2024 at 5:12 PM","I had a few friends, and while it did stress me out, constantly being worried that they secretly hated me or whatever, I still loved being around them
However, one of them had a few cigarettes missing, and another guy said he saw me take them. I didn't take them. But they were all pretty mad at me because they thought I did.
I don't think he lied intentionally, he's a saint lol, so I'm not mad at him. I think he just missaw, he made a mistake but he still spoke up because he thought he was doing the right thing. He's a good guy, that's what I think at least. And I'm not mad at the girl who thinks I stole from her either, I understand her perspective and why she thinks I did, I'm more just mad/ upset with how everything played out as a whole
I deleted/ deactived my Snapchat account, which is the main way I would talk to them. The only reason I got it was to talk to one of the girls anyways ( the one who thinks I stole from her)
Ive had a lot of reasons I've wanted to kill myself, not just this one thing. If this was the only problem I had, I wouldn't go this far, but the stress, losing them, and the lack of trust is just gonna be the final nail in the coffin.
I was gonna wait awhile, I had a lot I wanted to do. Ive always wanted to make a song, I had plans to buy a base and train vocals and stuff like that. I wanted to be fluent in another language, I wanted to make my own, I wanted to collect more vinyls, I wanted to own more band stuff, I wanted to get more into the things that interest me, I had books on grimoires and the golden dawn that I was saving up for. I'll regret never being able to do these things. I'll regret leaving my cat, darrbie. But that's all. I wish I got to experience these things and spend more time with my cat, for awhile, these things were all that kept me alive.
I have 35 .25mg klonopin pills; a bottle of vodka; 2 thc edibles that add up to 35g; Buscopan, which releases the hallucinogenic Scopolamine when you crush and smoke it; and these other pills I don't remember the name of lol.
If I don't overdose or something, I'll shoot myself. I found the key to my parents gun cabinet.

I've had a pretty good life, with some exceptions, I don't know why I always feel the way that I do.
I don't know if my parents were together or not when I was born, just that they were never married. If they were together at all, it ended quickly.
My mom was 24 or 25 when I was born, I think my dad was 48. I spent most of my time with my mom, she would bring me up to my dads, but he would never come down to visit. My sister, who I believe is a year or 2 older than my mom, would watch over me + her two kids, my dad was always too busy drinking with his buddies.
My 4th birthday was the last time I saw him, for 11 years after that I didn't know him or anybody on that side of the family
When I was 5, I made friends with this guy who terrified me, I only stuck around him because he would beat everyone up, especially the girls, and I didn't want him to hurt me. We were friends until I dropped out before 11th grade started. The entire time that I knew him, he terrified me. I only stuck around because he was genuinely insane and I just didn't want him to hurt me. I hated having to deal with him. It didn't matter if he was 5 or if he was 16, he always knew how to terrify me, and I don't even know if he ever knew I was so afraid of him.
I stopped attending school regularly in the 8th grade. I was fine the first few months, then I only went a few days out of the week, then I was barley going at all. During 9th grade, I only went a few days during the whole year. 10th grade was in between these two.
I don't know what was wrong with me, I felt miserable, empty, demotivated, and a lot of my beliefs made absolutely no sense. I struggled with basic hygiene, I was unhealthy in every way imaginable, I thought and acted weirdly.
My mother was also genuinely cruel during this time was well, especially when she found out I was suicidal. I don't even want to think about the way she acted. Sometime around 9th or 10th grade, I started doing a bit better, but had a newfound overwhelming anxiety that I couldn't cope with. I was always anxious, but this was unbearable. It, among other things, further kept me away from school
I'm currently in an adult basic education ( ABE ) program
i would drink a lot when I was 15, I don't think it was to the point of addiction, but I stopped after awhile. I also snorted the klonopin i was prescribed too. I did it in front of people ( omegle ) and obviously they would say weird shit, and get me to do weird shit. And I'd hear stuff like ""you're the coolest 15 year old ever"" from this one guy. Though, I did get a lot of laughs because I crushed the pills with a wall cross, so it wasn't all bad I guess
This one person made me talk even after the initial meeting on omegle. I gathered the courage to end it after a few weeks, but those were the worst, most stressful few weeks of my life
Shortly after, I reached out to my dad. I met the sister that looked after me, my other older sister on that side, her kids, and that's it. I guess I'll also regret never meeting my eldest sisters kids, because we would hang out all the time when she was looking after me, and I missed them for my entire life. They're both slightly older than me.
The last time I saw him was august of last year I believe.
I kind of recently got into contact with my old friend from 7th-8th grade, who introduced me to another old friend and her main friend group. I loved everything about her, I kind of went on a ""health kick"" the few years I was completely alone, so it was nice to just abandon that. She got me into smoking, weed, and we drank together as well. We broke into a church and tried to break into a gas station, my fondest memories, they only happened like a week ago.
I stole a few souvenirs from the church, she broke into places looking for money, I was just having fun. I got my first ( and last, I guess. I wanted more, maybe that's another regret ) tattoo from her mom. It's a harp.
It was nice to meet someone who matched my desire to truly not care about these types of things, even if we had some slight differences in our reasonings
I trusted her more than anyone, shocking due to the short length of time we've been friends again. And I thought that feeling was mutual, as she told me about a miscarriage from when she was either 15 or 16, and she said she only told a few people, she doesn't want it to get out. …so sorry I guess lol
So, she came into the room we were all hanging out in, asked who stole her cigarettes. We all waited outside, except for the guy who would go on to say it was me, he doesn't smoke so she let him stay in. She came out a few minutes later, angry, her anxiety pills were gone too. They ended up finding MOST of them in a makeup case, which leads me to believe they weren't misplaced, because how do you misplace some of your anxiety pills in a makeup case? Definitely on purpose. By who, I don't know. But they likely think it's me. Shitty. She comes out again, says this guy told her it was me. I go inside to talk to him, he was firm in his response. Adamant that he was ""almost certain"" I took them whenever I asked. However, I did not take them. I genuinely have no idea where they went. They searched all my stuff, all my bags, no trace. Obviously. But they still think it was me, just that I hid them somewhere
But I didn't have pockets, sleeves, or a bra, I didn't have anywhere to hide them. That purse is not quiet, it has a loud chain and it kinda snaps open, I know because it used to be mine. So, I wouldn't had to open the purse, open the cigarette box, take out 3, and put it all back. In front of 3 people, might I add. He said it happened in front of 3 people, the other 2 people say they didn't see anything. Which makes sense, because nothing happened. They were mad at me, she was certain I took it. I would go on, adamant it wasn't me, repeating it over and over again, but of course she wouldn't listen, why would she? A trustworthy guy told her otherwise. She even told me
"" I don't care that you took them, you can keep them, just admit it."" Obviously, I didn't ""admit"" anything, I didn't do it, and I'm not gonna lie like that, even if the stress/ anxiety was unbearable and made me want to
I don't really feel betrayed, but I feel like I should. Again, I don't think he was being malicious, I think he was just mistaken about what he saw. He's a good guy, and I don't hold that against him
So, that was a few days ago. One girl in the group messaged me on Facebook messenger to ask why I removed her from Snapchat, I explained that I just deactivated the acc, but aside from that, I haven't heard a word from any of them.
I don't wanna go back to having no friends, but even though I'm not MAD at them, im still upset about how things played out, and upset that she didn't trust me enough to even consider the possibility that I didn't do it, because clearly, she fully believed him. I don't wanna be around people who don't trust me, but im not mad. And I'll miss them. At least for 6 days
I'm thinking before I shoot myself, I reactivate my account just to tell them I missed them, and that I was grateful for the short time we got to spend together again. Truthfully, this is a good time to go out. Multiple years with no friends, completely alone, and then I'm quickly thrust into a few friend group where I already feel like I belong. Getting to experience such an amazing group of people, even if I was always scared they secretly hated me, is the best possible thing I could hope to achieve towards the end of my life, and I'm grateful, I would have it any other way.
I don't want to name names, and I don't know if any of them would ever read this, but if they are, they know who they are. The girl I stole cigarettes from, she's a great person, brave, confident, bold. She always stands her ground and defends the people she cares about. I was ecstatic when she agreed to hang out again, and apparently she was too, she used to talk about me all the time with her mom, who told me she cried when I messaged her.
Her sister, while I didn't know her for long and didn't speak much to her, also seemed like a great person. She seemed fun loving, happy, and like she really cares about her friends.
Her best friend, the one who wrote me on messenger, is also someone I didn't know long. But I thought her to be funny, and great to be around. I was always disappointed when she wasn't with the group for whatever reason
The boyfriend of the other girls sister has quickly become one of my favourite people. I found him very easy to talk to and to get along with, he was fun, but he also seemed to genuinely like the people he was around. He asked me if I was okay while I was being accused of stealing the cigarettes, probably because I seemed upset. He also snapped me a few times on the way back to my house. I don't know if a single person believed me, but if anyone did, it was probably him.
The boyfriend of the sisters best friend, I didn't know him well. But like the last guy, he was fun and easy to get along with
I'll miss all of them, they made the last of my life as good as it could possibly be, thank you",,,,,,,,

,2593818,b_adr,"Jul 12, 2024 at 8:51 AM","Could someone please comment thoughts on combining SN with Corvalol in large quantities for a knock-down effect? It contains small doses of phenobarbital (~11 mg), but I am not sure how could I get down a large enough quantity (say 150 capsules) to have a decent sedative effect. Perhaps get the powder out of capsules and mix it with a small amount of water, to ingest it in a similar way like SN? Around 1-2 hours before taking the SN, as I am extremely anxious about the SN experience (vomiting, feeling of suffocation, etc.). I get that being unconscious does not prevent you from vomiting and it makes it even more likely for all of it to enter the lungs, but I really want to find a way to be unconscious for the most of it.

Corvalol composition for 1 tablet:
Ethyl ester of α-bromoisovaleric acid / bromisovalum (derivative of bromine and valeric acid) — 12.42 mg
Phenobarbital — 11.34 mg
Peppermint oil — 0.88 mg
I also have other medicines listed below, and I am trying to understand the counteractions, which there unfortunately are, especially related to opposing effects on heart rate, as well as muscle (spasms vs relaxation). Here is a compilation of their mechanism of action by ChatGPT (not sure how reliable it is, I edited it though, but if you catch any mistakes, please, let me know):


Mechanism of action Phenobarbital
Ethyl Ester of α-Bromoisovaleric Acid (Bromisoval)
Promethazine
Ondansetron
Domperidon
Enhancer of GABA-A receptor activity (sedation, anxiolysis, relaxation of muscles, anticonvulsant effects, respiratory depression) ✓ ✓
Antagonist of histamine H1 receptor (slight sedation, slight antiemetic for motion sickness, slight relaxation of muscles, antiarrhythmic effects) ✓
Blocks dopamine via D2 receptor (antiemetic, muscle spasms, restlessness) ✓ ✓ ✓
Serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (antiemetic, can induce headaches, dizziness, diarrhea, QT prolongation) ✓
Enhancer of gastrointestinal motility ✓
Anticholinergic effects (sedation, hallucinations, dry mouth, blurry vision, drowsiness, increased heart rate, cardiac abnormalities) ✓",,,,,,,,
,2593920,Relic,"Jul 12, 2024 at 11:07 AM","Phenobarbital is a potent cytochrome P450 inducer, so it will increase the effect of promethazine, but decreases the effect of ondansetron. Domperidone metabolism seems to be increased, which could result in amplified effect. Some 1700 mg of pheno is a large dose, and can be lethal in itself. Do you have a tolerance/take it regularly? The timing could get very difficult, even if the effects of Corvalol are otherwise well-known.",,,,,,,,

No, I am not using any kind of medication and therefore have no tolerance. I just know that I really want to be knocked out, as the information available about SN indicates that the sensation of breathlessness can be severe, and in some cases the death struggle can last up to 4 hours. I am truly horrified by this idea. I am also thinking about injecting a bit of thiopental right after ingesting SN for extra quick knockout effect. But, again, I am worried about taking all these different medications - both because of the counteractions and also timing, as you said. Would prefer to only take what is necessary.",2593920,,,,,,,

Some have taken this substance recreationally, and report waking up two days later with no idea what day it is. I think the dose was 200 mg. It's a complete black hole pill, and there is not much control over anything once it kicks in.

That's understandable, but I don't think these thoughts normally go away, even if it is known for sure that nothing can go wrong. I can just say that with pheno, it is very hard to care much about anything under its influence, and the dose for that does not need to be anywhere near 1700 mg. That would be just a complete lights out for a very long time, if not lethal.

That would require precision and tenacity that is unlikely to be there.",2593933,2593933,2593933,,,,,

,2570660,littleinsanity,"Jun 22, 2024 at 1:04 PM","For what it matters, I'm female, 22.
I've always felt suicidal, however I've never gone through with it.
I've been close to it but I'm still here.
Recent events however pushed me to the edge, but I don't mean to tell my life story or what's happened here.
I've been reading threads on this site for a year now and wanted to talk to people who at least understand the need to not exist.
Being a new member (I apologize if this wasn't the best tag for the thread) I'll give some insight:
Recent events were a complex situation and I fucked up most things myself, and last Sunday night to Monday I while being drunk I got the courage to ctb.

After all, for a lot of us I assume, being scared of the pain is what stops you, so being in Europe I've been envious of Americans for having access to guns as I'd love foe it to be somewhat simpler at least.
It would be my first choice.

It's not how I want to go but I thought of jumping in front of a train because I could not bear it anymore, thankfully or regretfully a friend who I had been in a call with that night while drunk heard me saying I will die(?) and them texting me the entire time made it harder to go through it along with all the vomiting, kind of funny.
But now that I'm more calm, I think me be being willing to go through the pain and issues it'd cause others, is a sign that It's time for me.

So not tomorrow, but next Sunday, at night or the day after a long planned trip with my bestfriends, I plan to drink just in case for courage and to jump from the hotel building we'll be staying at.
That is to say if we get the room we asked for.
I thought about over drinking as a + and taking meds to not throw up and make the symptoms worse but it seems that might just be a bad idea. I also intend to being a rope for hanging in case I get desperate but that's always been one of the options I'd like to avoid most.

I haven't decided if I should do so at night coming up with some excuse to go back to the hotel for a bit, or stay a night longer than them, to take my time.
In the second case, even though I am 22, I would be spending a night outside my house without my parents consent sending them into panic and if caught, disowned and more which would luckily or unluckily not allow me to change my mind.
I am worried however to traumatize my friends and ruin the trip for them in the first option.

If this doesn't work out my only option for a building to jump from is my uni(third to fourth floor in both cases, far from ideal but I'll do my best to hit head first), where drinking right before to be able to feel less scared would be a little harder.
I know jumping might not be the best method and the height will likely not be enough, I like the sn method I found out about through this site but I don't think I could be able to go through with it and prep for it properly.
(It's also funny how this site made me sometimes hold on longer even though I hoped to find resources to end it)

Realistically I can only go through with something simple like this, what do you think? Would you still jump? Do you think you can actually go through a whole step by step process?

The other thing I wondered is if I should actually let any friend know right before I die.
I want to call my ex, but while we broke long ago we liked eachother till recently, till my depression got the worst of me to the point I became exhausting for him to deal for him to deal with me at all, I treated him awfully and we are now no contact.
So calling him before it is a bad idea right?
I want to hear his voice once, but even if he were to answer, I'd also rather not leave him with any trauma.
In the end, if I die, even though he is aware of my suicidal thoughts, it's likely he will never know about me passing on unless a friend decides to go out of their way. And perhaps making sure he never knows could be the only act of love I could do for him now?
I feel the same towards some irl and online friends, I've pushed all of them away now, because I feel guilty as this choice would hurt them.

Am I not allowed just a little bit of peace? To leave without pain, without guilt or to have one last happy moment?
I know I'm selfish but I regret not having died when I felt like I could go through it.

I've been dreaming every night for a week now, before it felt like I ruined everything in my life, about dying. I dreamt of slowly passing on in my bed and my body just dying and waking up and feeling like my body decided to actually die and have feel my limbs numb. And it might be messed up but It felt good, I was confused but so glad I could pass on peacefully and have what I wanted but ofcourse slowly I felt my body back, like it was just asleep.
I miss how peaceful it felt to be able to be free.

Also!
I've always felt stuck but tried to do what I wanted to instead of what I should (which doesn't exactly bring great results), but I wonder how do you decide between what you should do and what you want to do?
What do you think I should do, what would you do?

I'm just tired. Thank you for the long read.",,,,,,,,

,2570775,Linda,"Jun 22, 2024 at 2:35 PM","Don't jump from the ""third or fourth floor"". You will probably finish up alive but badly injured. I don't know how high your hotel room is, but if it's less than 100 feet above the ground, I would advise you not to jump from that either. To be reasonably sure of dying (9 out of 10 chance) you need a height of at least 100 feet and a hard landing, e g. on concrete. Higher than that is better still, if you want to be more than 9 out of 10 sure.
If you are determind to die, you need to plan it much more thoroughly than you seem to be doing. There is a lot of information on this site. (Use the search feature, if you have access to it. If you don't have access to it yet, you will after a few more posts.)
I don't know what your situation is, and you indicated that you would prefer not to explain, so I'll have to try to read between the lines of what you post. Doing that is difficult, and I know that it is prone to error, but when I do it I am left wondering whether ctb really is the best choice for you. Have you ever talked to a therapist about your situation? If you haven't, I would suggest that you do that, if possible, before you make a final decision on ctb. Your problems may be fixable.",2570660,,,,,,,

And no words seem enough to say goodbye.
I've been imagining their reaction because of the things said by my friend who stopped me.
It's hard to comfort them while hurting them like this..
I said third/fourth floor because that's how we count them in Italy but ig it would be fourth/fifth (still not a huge difference).
I agree that it's not a reasonable plan but I dont have access to many options. A train would work better but it's one of the worst ways to go and troublesome for others.
I'm also not particularly scared of heights so it just seemed easier to go through with. Maybe I just need to look for an accessible building or go to the mountains or drown (another really bad way to go though).
My ideal method really is sn but something that's just a one step act is all I can actually bring myself to do.

I had been considering going to a therapist and still did these days but even though I said I ""fucked up"" or ""ruined my life"" and whatever else, it's just a series of events where I made my life much worse suddenly.
I had always been considering it before it as well so it's not just a matter of fixing something that happened, it just feels like it's good timing?

,2571151,itsneverbeenmoreove,"Jun 22, 2024 at 9:18 PM","I would say that it depends what you're looking for. If you're contacting someone, you have to know that you could also being doing something very cruel to them. And while I am 100% in favor of people being able to chose to die, I don't think it's anyone's right to bring other people into that. So if you call someone for example, you put them in the position of either having to bear witness to your death, or try and stop you. I would say that wanting to call someone before you CTB is usually a sign that you're not fully committed and are looking for someone to ""save"" you. I think that's highly manipulative behavior that is often used by abusers and is just not very kind.

I think if you're going to contact people, yo should do it before, and you should not make it clear that you are planning on doing anything first. Additionally, if you have anything to say specifically in regards to ending your life, those things should be delivered to them after you CTB. Doing so beforehand can lead to interference and the other stuff I talked about. There's a reason suicide letters are so common. They're very effective.

A man that I thought I was compatible with didn't have the money (I'm assuming) to even being doing this in the first place. Just yesterday, I found out he was a real pedophile with photos of little girls. I reported him on the site I met him on and the NCMEC. I think I may give up on even trying to pursue anyone in any sexual or romantic way until I CTB. I'm also running out of money and I'll just barely be able to afford the SN and the other things I'll need to get with it for this to work and if it doesn't, I'll be left with less than $50 to my name. I still need to get my will done and I've started putting my things in totes to hopefully make things a little easier. I've heard about the law that's about to be passed on making the sale of SN illegal in the U.S. and it's only adding to this feeling that I have to leave now. Things keep getting worse because I've grown careless about the time that passes and I let my money just slip out of my hands. I couldn't care less about my safety, but I'm hoping that man is arrested or found out or something because I don't want him to find out I reported him and hurt the people I know or get more pictures and exploit those girls anymore.

I'm tired and I'm done. If the police don't take any initiative on this and he finds out I reported him, I just hope out of everything he could and might do, he only hurts and hopefully kills me. Just as long as that's where it ends.",,,,,,,,
,2500875,Illegal Preclear,"May 4, 2024 at 5:51 PM","I'm ready to CTB this year. My DESIRED Method: Firearm. It's ALWAYS been my desired method. Either with a .357 Magnum like Budd Dwyer (and the gun my best friend used to CTB coincidentally), or a shotgun (which is much cheaper and the 'gold standard' of firearms to CTB with). I've imagined myself installing a skylight in the back of my head since I was a teenager. No failed CTB attempts, one and done, total finality. THE PROBLEM: I have a Psychiatric record extending back to the age of 3. I'm diagnosed with Autism and Schizophrenia. I've been involuntarily committed 14 times, my first one being at 11 years old. In 2016, a filthy Psychroach (what Psychiatrists deserve to be called) marked me as ""a danger to others."" I've been through mental health court.

Criminal record wise: I'm totally clean. But I happen to live in New Jersey which has simultaneously the most Draconian gun laws AND if my history is any indication, the most Draconian mental health laws.

As a backup method, I consider myself BLESSED to have a home with a literal perfect hanging area, and I already have a quality nautical supply rope. Full suspension hanging is a tried and true method, but there's no question it's not as ideal as using a firearm. I really, really want to go out with a firearm. Have you ever seen the infamous Budd Dwyer video? That guy was dead before he hit the ground.

Someone on here mentioned a website called Armslist, which I've been checking out, but I'm very paranoid about getting caught purchasing a gun, and it being deemed an ""illegal purchase"" by police. And the police literally know my face around here from how many times the Psychiatric system has sicked them on me. In the state of New Jersey - being caught with a gun illegally is 3 to 5 years in prison.

So I'm faced with this dilemma: Obtain a firearm which guarantees instant death, but risk going to jail at any point in the obtaining of or owning of it. OR opt for full suspension hanging - which carries the risk of something going wrong resulting in vegetative brain damage.

So what say you all? Is there a way I could access a firearm with minimal legal risk, OR should I just suck it up and go for full suspension hanging? (Keep in mind I really, REALLY would rather go out via firearm)",,,,,,,,

If I could gain access to a firearm even for 5 minutes - I'd be willing to CTB with it right then and there. But I can't stress enough how much I fear getting caught by Psychiatrists than I do death.

I can assure you no one in America is afraid to deny anyone their constitutional rights, and not a single ""right"" on the constitution can't be taken away in an instant. In fact I like to play a game with people - I say ""Name one thing you think is bad about the Chinese Government, and I'll give you an example of how the same thing is done in America, but sneakier, crueler, and less dignified."" Every ""Freedom"" the US boasts to the world has a LOT of fine print underneath - especially if you happen to be Disabled.",2565635,2532673,,,,,,

To perform an extrajudicial kidnapping and lock someone up without any criminal charges or citations and deny them legal counsel is literally just our Psychiatry System. And any authority figure can make up bullshit about someone and say they're insane. ""Oh I saw this person who is critical of the government smearing his feces on the walls the other day, lock him up."" But we're soooo much better than China, right? If reincarnation is real I'm hoping I respawn in China. But my point is US Governmental Authorities can ""make someone disappear"" just as easy as the countries we try ever so hard to scare people about.

See, I've never been to a gun show. The closest one I could drive to would be one in Pennsylvania, and while not as bad as New Jersey, they're still pretty blue.

So first - I'd have to find a Pennsylvania gun show that coincides during a time when my family is on vacation. And if I manage to purchase a gun, I'd pretty much have to CTB the day I got it. If SI kicks in and I choke...that's going to be very problematic. Because I'm very targeted due to my Psychiatric Record. Driving back home with a gun - if I get pulled over - I'm finished. If I'm caught owning a gun at any point - I'm finished. And by finished I mean put into a Psychiatric Facility indefinitely.

That's not to say I haven't given up on it - the stars could align and I could make it to a gun show and I could certainly go through with it.

But I've gotten to the point where I've weighed the pros and cons of full suspension hanging via shotgun in the mouth -

-I already have the rope (one that was actually featured in one of the hanging megathreads on here).

-I've already tested the rope - tied the slipknot and had 'practice sessions' to learn how to close off the proper arteries, get used to what it feels like - the 'head explosion' feeling, the pressure and all. I thankfully have a very high pain tolerance and I can see myself being able to take it until unconsciousness sets in.

-I have an ideal spot - a railing that won't buckle with ample space below.

-If I do it during the night when my family is on vacation - there's a 0% chance I'll be interrupted.

So even though there's more pain involved - it's much less risky to hang than risk legal and Psychiatric intervention by purchasing a gun.

I thank everyone on here for their advice, though. If anyone has any out of left field ideas on how to get a shotgun undetected, I'm all ears. But right now I've shifted to putting all my chips down on hanging.",2565879,2586184,,,,,,

Gun shows are not going to take chances with private sellers at them selling to anyone with no restrictions. Even at your local shows in Pennsylvania, you can expect the private sellers to at least require buyers to present a PA id, and the gun shows may require additional things on top of that, such as a bill of sale.

I agree with you. I'm not sure who the constitution applies to, but it's evidently not to everyone. For those who it doesn't reapply apply to, they may as well be in China or Cambodia.

Interestingly, after looking up gun laws through US history, these severe bans and restrictions of possession of firearms are relatively new. Early in the 20th Century and as late as 1967, anyone who wanted a gun could order one through mail order, and it would be looked at like any other purchase, and did not require any permission to buy or own.",2586184,2565879,,,,,,

If you want to look at his social media it's
@joshua.d or FaceMcShooty on TikTok and Shotmyselfff on Instagram.

Details
This was an impulsive attempt, done with a 12g shotgun buckshot.
The exit wound was back of ear curved around skull.

Story
Loudest bang you can imagine, ears ringing ripped his head to the left (he thought he broke his neck), instantly regretted it and pounded on the wall for his brother who came in and called 911 (apparently he believed the gunshot was just him banging shit in his room because he was mad, but it was the calling and knocking that made him check on him) He described the blood as a deep gurgling sensation and couldn't breathe so he put the injured side of his face down and only felt cold. At that point he's on his knees, with his head on the ground so the blood could drain. The carpet was completely soaked, he doesn't remember anything after this but second hand accounts say that he was responsive to the paramedics and talking with them.

How did it feel?
Like a giant flash of heat, like opening an oven, the heat goes through his entire body and then he just feels wet. Then felt instant cold (from major blood loss) and hit with intense tiredness, but his SI kicked in and called and knocked for help.

Angle
He missed the brain stem (obviously) but people without firearm training or knowledge might not realize that SI will cause you to flinch, which could make you miss even with the right angle.

Damage
PTSD
deaf in right ear
face is a paralyzed on the right side
won't regain strength in the face, shot went through and disconnected the nerves
damaged tear duct and nose cavity so constant tears and nose running on right side
he hasn't had a cat scan done but he can tell he has brain damage, terrible memory issues
has vertigo when lifting his head and laying on the back of his head
jaw couldn't open BUT surgery to repair and he can open it now (not as much as before) and can eat sandwiches and burgers (with difficulty)
had a staph infection on the one year anniversary and the jaw surgery to open his jaw got infected, but both cleared up
none of his teeth were hit, however the gas from the gun burned all of his gums down to his jaw bone

Can he own a gun?
Yes! He can own weapons but buying weapons is tricky lol

Debt
500 thousand dollars (uninsured), fortunately all the procedures that weren't done by specialists were paid for, excluding MRI's, X-rays, facial surgery.

My Thoughts
I would discourage this type of method for anyone in my opinion, although there is a high success rate, there is still a possibility of survival and ending up with lasting damage. This can occur with any method of course but this one is rather messy and if you don't want your family and friends scrapping off your skull and blood from the walls while you're in the hospital or casket (because if your don't hire professionals then your family will do the cleaning) then don't do this route. I know people on this site dislike people who are pro-life or whatever but this thread was made to discourage anyone from taking their life—at least in this way. Even if you try and use it to your advantage, beating your SI is extremely hard and I believe success with this method is based on luck rather than any previous skill, as even if you are a trained marksmen you're trained in shooting targets other than yourself. This thread was made mostly for myself to lean away from CTB as an option and also for any others contemplating it and to steer them away as well.",,,,,,,,

My reply will come from extensive research that I've been doing since January.

As for him looking decent, he had extensive surgery done, hundreds of thousands of dollars. But from the front you can still see the damage:

""Right to his mouth"" but perpendicular still misses the brain. You want to generally aim for the brainstem:
The way to do this would either be through the side of the head right next to the ear or though the mouth at an angle. With a shotgun it's much easier through the mouth because it's hard to hold a long gun. What I've been doing is practicing the angle by using a measuring tape that is the exact length of the gun I want and talking pictures.

,2553616,makingaplan,"Jun 8, 2024 at 5:43 PM","Homeopathy would likely help that. It can help with many kinds of hyper sensitivities. Here's a quick AI search I did on what remedies might help.

Homeopathy is an alternative medical practice that treats symptoms with highly diluted substances that, in larger amounts, would produce symptoms similar to the ones being treated. It's important to note that homeopathic remedies are not scientifically proven to be effective and should not replace conventional medical treatments. However, if someone with hyperacusis seeks treatment from a homeopath, the practitioner might prescribe one of the following remedies based on the individual's specific symptoms and overall health:

1. Belladonna: Often used for acute conditions where there is sudden onset of symptoms, including sensitivity to sound, along with symptoms like throbbing headaches or a flushed face.
2. Lycopodium: May be recommended for individuals who experience sensitivity to noise, particularly if they also have digestive issues, bloating, or a preference for warm drinks.
3. Phosphorus: Used for individuals who are sensitive to light, sound, and other sensory inputs, often accompanied by a craving for cold drinks and a tendency to bleed easily.
4. Natrum Salicylicum: Sometimes prescribed for hyperacusis related to conditions like tinnitus or if there is an accompanying sensation of fullness in the ears.
5. China (Cinchona): May be used for individuals who experience sensitivity to sound along with general weakness or a history of significant fluid loss.
6. Chamomilla: Often recommended for children or adults who are irritable, hypersensitive to noise, and have difficulty calming down.

Important Considerations

• Individualization: Homeopathic treatment is highly individualized. The homeopath will consider the person's overall physical, emotional, and psychological state when selecting a remedy.
• Consultation: It's crucial to consult with a qualified homeopathic practitioner for a proper evaluation and personalized remedy selection.
• Complementary Care: While homeopathy may offer relief for some, it should be used as a complementary approach rather than a substitute for conventional medical advice and treatment, especially for conditions like hyperacusis which can have underlying medical causes.

One place you can look for, and choose a homeopath is the website homeopathy247.com

For me at least, there is a sort of existential terror, more than a desire to live. Because I have what I consider a lot of positive reason that I want to CTB and also some not so great reasons to CTB (not that I feel like I should be judging anyone's reasons) and as a result, it might be expected that actually going through with it wouldn't be that hard. Like, even the guilt-tripping from loved ones, and all the positive things that do exist, those aren't what really deter me. If you're dead, you're dead, and you don't exist when you're dead so none of those things will be a concern to you because there won't be a you. It's that latter part that really fucks with me. The concept of nonexistence.

As much as I despise existence, as much as I find the good things in this world not worth all the negatives, as much as I experience tremendous emotional pain, as much as I hate myself, and all of those things. As much as I have all these things I really hate about existing and make me feel like CTB would be better both for me and for others, I am scared of non-existence. Because what does non-existence mean? Like, actually what does it mean to not exist? What is nothing? I'm not sure it's possible to actually conceptualize nothing.

Try imagining nothing. Close your eyes and imagine nothing. Guess what. You failed. You just imagined something. You probably imagined an empty void or maybe a 0, but you imagined something. There is something that you imagined. That empty void is something. It's a void that doesn't have anything in it, but that's something. So what is non-existence? You can't die and then wake up dead. You don't exist as dead, you simply don't exist. And that is very very scary to my living mind. Because there just doesn't seem to be a way to conceptualize not-existing. You won't be dead and realize you dont exist. You just wont exist. There wont be a you to do anything. And that is scary to me.

As much as I crave that non-existence, as much as I crave the ability to actually choose to CTB, as much as I crave escape, I cannot help but be terrified by that very nonexistence. It's not the prospect of dying, it's the prospect of being dead that my mind just seems unable to handle. And as I result I still exist and it fucking sucks.

,2586065,AmericanMary,"Jul 5, 2024 at 9:26 AM","I pretty much live in SaSu chat rooms. Today the ""man v bear"" debate resurfaced. This is me typing out thoughts I have on this topic, in one place, to have them together.

TW SA & pew pews



I stated that I would pick the bear over any man in the entire world, including my own father or husband. Neither have ever physically hurt me without consent. I fully believe that when a man ""gets hungry enough,"" he is capable of anything. By this: if a man and a women are in a forest together for years, with no way out, nobody around, I do believe a man would get desperate and horny enough to hurt her.

*are all men horrible? No ofc not. But every girl knows a bad man.
*its not just women who are hurt. I know this. Anybody who is SA is valid. Is it the same thing. It is the same pain. It is honestly stigmatized more when it happens to men. My experience just so happens to be as a woman.
*woman do SA people too. Ik this. Anybody can do it. Statistically proven, men do it so much more often. My experience has been with men.
*these are my thoughts and my mind. Here is why:

When I was 15 a man shoved his fingers inside of me inside of a block buster where he worked. My mom was a few isles over. He harassed (groomed) me for years. I was a child.

When I was 18 I got drunk for the first time and passed out. I woke up covered in my own blood & my ass in more pain than it ever has been. I was a lesbian at the time.

When I was 19, a friends dad shoved me into his truck. He had a gun pointed at me and told me ""you scream, I shoot."" I watched a clock pass for three hours while the gun never was more than a few inches away from my head.

When I was 21, the worst one happened. It involved a baseball bat & stitches. And 2 more times after that. All different people.

""Why didn't you tell anyone? Why didn't you tell police?"" I did for about half of them. Nothing happened and I gave up.

6 men. 6 white men. I was romantically and sexually involved with 0 of them. It is statistically proven that most SA is by somebody you know. This was not my case.

Is it wrong to be scared of someone simply for being a man? Probably. But my experience on this planet has completely shaped my mind and how I view the world, the future.

I am scared that a lot of men, given the opportunity, will chose to please himself over protect a girl.
this is why I pick the bear. I would rather a bear kill me to eat and feed its family, than a man who keeps me alive for years just to abuse and torture me for his own gain.
*""it's not all men. There are good men."" True. There are good bears too. How do you know you're not going to end up with a bear that is too scared to approach you? How do you know it wouldn't be a cub that you grow up with?
*id rather die than have my life threatened so a man can get off. I'd rather die that live with any of the mental pain. This is already half the reason I'm on SaSu.

it's interesting to me how this debate has gotten so out of hand.
*Men cannot even respect a women's answer in a hypothetical situation. This is our personal choice. Why do you have such an issue with it? Why are men not asking ""why"" we pick the bear? Instead yell, laugh, and mock us.
*now there is a new trend where men are asked ""women or dog in a desert?"" Men are picking the dog because it's easier to support than a women. Or the woman because he can fuck her and not the dog.

Interesting. WoMen pick the bear because we don't want to be raped. Men pick the dog for convince, or the women for sex. This is quite telling. The same men who have an issue with women picking the bear for safety.

I understand that my views are quite extreme. My life has been quite extreme. It is impossible to understand the mental toll this takes on you if you haven't lived it. Thst can be said about anything.


6 men have already done it to me and have gotten away with it. Millions of children are SAd by their own family. Sex trafficking is a huge problem in the world. I can name hundreds of women who have been raped and have either died, committed ctb from it or was left so physically harmed. The incel community literally plans mass rape and murders on women. People share gore videos of men raping women who are dying instead of helping them.

Why would I assume a man wouldn't do this, given nobody is around for years and he could get away with it? It is already happening everywhere.

The worst thing a bear will do is kill me to eat. We do the same thing to bears. The worst thing a man could do to me is unspeakable.

I love when people throw ""a bear will kill you a man wouldn't"" at me on here. Like bitch. We are talking on SaSu. Does a bear killing me sound like a bad thing? Really?


I'm not really looking to get into a debate. I am open, should it be done so in a mature and controlled away. I am tired of typing out the same responses over and over again, and would like have my thoughts on the subject in one place.

If you're posting hate & belittling comments, save the keyboard stokes.

I am uncomfortable around men. But I do not hate someone for being a man. I do not think women are better than men. I am not condoning sexist behavior, but sharing my experience and views with the world.",,,,,,,,

,2105312,SexyIncél,"Aug 2, 2023 at 4:30 PM","What's ""romantic love""? It's actually a peculiar form of love

Some study it, like Martians analyzing one of our varied strains of social organization. I haven't looked at the lit, but what I heard:
influenced by the Romantic movement around 1800-1850; modified by the modernist movement around 1900
it's changed. Back in the Romantic movement, you weren't actually supposed to achieve the object of your desires! It's supposed to remain contemplation & fantasy. No, that's a modern notion that would've disturbed them. Maybe we're supposed to be alienated; and our desire for an antidote to alienation might strike them as a form of clinical depression
those Romantic era guys were nostalgic for distorted bits of medieval traditions, like nowadays people around the world enjoy the nostalgia for themes in US country music

Take for example this statement about modern romantic love: ""Romantic love as it occurs in our civilisation, inextricably bound up with ideas of monogamy, exclusiveness, jealousy and undeviating fidelity does not occur in Samoa.""

So it's not just ""That nice thing that good couples do"". No, it has peculiar properties. Such as jealousy. Maybe jealousy partly comes from how we gain social value when people see us being crazily loved. So we get outraged when someone touches our lovers-as-property... it doesn't generate such social value if others get to use it & bear its fruits

So do some people have romantic love? Yes. But less stably than people think. Social relations generally aren't durable; for one thing, they need to be frequently refreshed or they weaken. And institutions like marriage may ironically harm the bonds


But suppose we mean ""romantic love"" to just mean a couple people who care deeply about each other, support each other's needs/desires pretty well, and get transformed into better people. It certainly exists

Unfortunately, we're often not taught to effectively care for each other. Instead, we act like twitchy neurotics after being in prison-like situations: involuntary schooling, workplaces where they have no free speech. With parents who are shit examples

Few get enough free time to understand themselves, and improve

So people are constantly belittling each other & such. Guys neg their girls to gain the upper hand; girls play jealousy games to provoke displays of desire from their guys. All a giant clusterfuck

So I'd think it's rarer than we'd hope",,,,,,,,

With tinder it did something different. Historically women have overlooked the appearance of a guy for his other traits. Tinder and other apps made it all about appearance and vanity. Other traits ceased to become important. Culturally it had already begun to shift. Women have in a sense taken on a far more masculine role and essentially became men themselves. Men have began to become far more feminized. What's occurred now is when all that matters is vanity to extent. Take this article . My favorite part of it is the author spending the time to ostracize and critique a group of individuals for really no reason at all then to make themselves feel better. I know why I haven't had luck with the fairer sex. 1) Too busy didn't go out was study my ass off to get into or in medical school/working/ etc... 2) Poor social skills 3) Didn't try/didn't find most girls around me attractive or worth my time. 4) Not looking for a one night stand... The interesting part of the article is the author indirectly states that there is a group of guys that gets a significant amount of messages.... Average looking guys which isn't particularly surprising given that's what psychology has told us for years. Women's definition of attractive is just different. The point being is this. Tinder made it so women have a significantly more narrow definition of who they want and.... Like the article says if they don't get it they don't care they'll live by themselves and be their own husband. Why? Because society has decided to devalue men significantly. It's just a fact. In other words it isn't more options necessarily but a restriction in the people they are choosing. Ultimately, time will tell but I would expect when this generation especially women are in their 40s or 50s we will see the greatest rise in depression we have ever seen. Because they will find themselves very very alone. And at that point after decades of words and actions devaluing men with nothing to give in return in the way of having kids... Combined with coping strategies and general lack of care I am not sure they will ever find love and will likely die alone. See here not sure why medium is my source du jour but 45% of women will be single in 2030. Fascinating because it sort of seems like tinder expediated a general fracturing of society.

To answer the question yes I do believe in romantic love it's been shown over and over again in history. I think society has been told and is moving in the direction of vanity and vanity alone. With little care towards the other characteristics. As for me do I think romantic love will occur for me? Nope extremely unlikely. That said hasn't it been said the strongest emotion is love?

This took a tangent but I hope someone finds something in it to hate or like.

,2105579,FormerlyFe(IV),"Aug 2, 2023 at 9:49 PM","Yes. I was in a ~3.5 year relationship of which I spent two years living with them. I loved them. I was as romantic as a dumb young college kid could be, I wouldn't bring her flowers but I would remember small remarks and then gift upon them later. We were passionate. And, when that addiction-passion was gone (like @pthnrdnojvsc mentioned) I did feel the slow down but I still did love them. I trusted them with my phone, bank accounts and they did too without second thought.

Sadly, things didn't work out, there were some incompatibility we couldn't iron out, or at least weren't mature enough to deal with. I broke up but it wasn't anything dramatic like someone cheating. It just wasn't working out, and they agreed.


That's eerily red-/black-pill rhetoric. Not really... I didn't even find my ex particularly attractive until an year into the relationship, after we had seen ourselves nude, that it ""hit me"" that she was sexy beyond belief. I didn't feel needed or cared like that, she did not need me but cared for me (and so did I for her), but it was more of a cool best-friends lovers partnership that was fun and deeply personal.

I don't know what ""best"" mean but it feels a lot like you're excluding a lot of men putting them into ""subpar"". I would consider myself subpar as well, I'm not particularly strong or attractive or financially well off, but it doesn't matter really. Being a kind person and having chemistry is way more important.


Yeah but also Tinder and other dating apps aren't the world, Most of Tinder users are male, not an equal balance of men or women.

I don't know what you're going on about in women becoming men because my horny brain is still attracted to modern women? Am I not supposed to be attracted to a woman who can deal with her own shit? Why can men only like A and women like B? We're all human and also so varied, there's no real point into arguing of what a person from a gender should want. Both men and women are fundamentally human. We still both have our emotions and backstories and quirks and preferences.

Also, what's with men becoming more feminized? Is the fact that I like being the little spoon sometimes problematic? Or that I have long hair or have cats? Like... I'm happy as to who I am and can attract people like that. I can't punch a man, or lift heavy weights, I'm a programmer nerd. Nor would I mind dating a woman stronger than me.


I have female friends that talked about their experience on Tinder to me. From what they've said, matches are indeed easy, sex is easy, but finding a man worth their damn time is actually pretty hard. There are a lot more men who are just ignorant or selfish in bed than you'd think. They eventually gave up on the app beyond hookups.

At the same time, I guess men were devalued? Like, if a woman can live off her own, then she can be pretty selective of which men she deals with. Settling down is less of a concern now because women in the past needed to settle because they needed a man to do some basic stuff sometimes. In some places it was less than 50 years ago where women needed permission of their husband to do anything at all.

As a personal note, I also learned the same about women, that some just aren't for me. I also used to think of a ""scarcity"" mindset and that ""any hole is a goal"". Not really though. I was with a woman that was just weird for me, that belittled me for being a girl for cuddling the wrong way or had super weird opinions on things. I was just Netflix and chilling and even then I was discomfortable. We parted ways. I now realize that nah, I'm not for most women nor are most women for me, as pretty or attractive they might be on paper. There is much more to it.

,2105622,DeadManLiving,"Aug 2, 2023 at 11:20 PM","Romance is a cultural artifact. Attractiveness is an appraisal of a person's transactional value or worthiness in our laissez-faire, capitalistic, free market dating ecosystem. We're all just participants in this sociobiological game of not losing opportunity and falling into temptation.

Men fall in love with what they see, and women fall in love with what they hear. Which is why women get buttlifts and men tell lies.

Relationships are transactional leases based on expectations that ultimately disappoint or depreciate, like cars. I think that what we're all looking for is an authentic human relationship. Easier to find a Jewish Aligator I could pull a golden tooth from and pass it through the eye of a needle than a loving, lasting, authentic human relationship.

Realistically, they do exist. There are good people out there who realize that while you're burning decades looking for the perfect person, you'll miss out on the imperfect one that would have made you perfectly happy. But who wants to settle these days? The odds are so slim, and the false hope is so luring. It's an unquenchable thirst, and eventually you'll run out of steam going from Mirage to Mirage in this sociobiological process of love and hunger games.

This data here fleshes it out further by saying women aren't looking https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/08/20/a-profile-of-single-americans/#:~:text=Among those who are married,to have met their partner. Family/Friends is the most common way well if that part of your life is rocky for whatever reason skip to two. Work 18% and School 17%. Removing school you are left with the next option of online e.g. dating apps at 12%.With the top 3 being situationally dependent online is actually arguably the most controllable way. In suburban or Urban areas it is actually 14%. Amongst those 18-29 21%. Meaning in the age demographic only Friends/Family and school are more common. Basically the only way for men to ""put themselves out there"" that they can control with the best chance is dating apps. Bars/Restaurants are 2% of couples 18-29. Now that that is settled let's move on.

I don't mean women are becoming literally men. I mean gender roles have switched. For instance amongst college students 60% are women and 40% are men. Almost inverted from the 1960s. Do I have a problem with women getting an education? Nope! Men are dropping the ball. Though to only to a moderate extent are they dropping the ball. Why? Boys/Men again are devalued. The perfect student as described statistically is *Female*. When is the last time you heard about a push to get men into the STEM field? Ever? Or college? Ever? Before you scoff that this is a new phenomenon that women are *just* now breaking the ceiling and going to college more then men.... Nope! Women have earned more degrees then men since the... *1980s*. Why is this a problem why are you bring it up broke? Because women want an *equal*. Why things like your job creates relationships or school where you are taking the same classes. Women now are left with a choice by and large marry someone that isn't their equal, sleep around never marry, or never marry and don't sleep around. At the same time society is lifting up women more and more and denigrating men for being born into a system in which they are devalued. This article slightly touches on the topic https://dailycollegian.com/2018/04/schools-are-designed-more-for-girls-than-for-boys/ and so does this one https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-unreported-gender-gap-in-high-school-graduation-rates/ or this one https://www.patheos.com/blogs/roger...tion-against-boys-in-education-and-elsewhere/ . With the latter article showing data that says boys are not only given worse grades because of (natural) behavior but women are expected to perform better. Boy/men are meeting those expectations.

I say this as someone who not only as a male who went to college for psychology but also medical school. I also was a bodybuilder and many other things.... I will also say the reason I did relatively okay in school was because I went to private school where the discipline bordered on abuse and if you talked or did anything disruptive you were going to have an extra bad day. Once you finished with your work you could basically just read. Lucky for me I enjoy reading unlucky for me the social skills normally you would develop I didn't.

Women are outperforming men and they are left looking over their shoulders going I don't have an equal now. Before you scoff well women are smarter! Sort of but no. Men are more polarized more men are geniuses then women and more men are born intellectually disabled. Women are born intellectually by data more average. Here is the issue not only are women outperforming men scholastically but they are also narrowing the amount of men they will date outside of that. Which means those that will date will only date a subset of men and the others won't date at all. *AND* the system is built to make these problems even worse. though maybe not horrendously to be fair as even universities and colleges are noticing see here https://hechingerreport.org/an-unno...college-its-harder-for-women-to-get-in/though when some action is taken it is immediately labeled discrimination see here https://www.vox.com/2015/2/17/80502...women-is-a-real-problem-in-college-admissions . Bottom line women want an equal which is becoming rarer because of the devaluing of males, women are narrowing their selection because of technology, and they aren't dating because of any number of reason but largely I would assume because of both the tech associated with it and lack of appropriate suitors. Again blame society. This is at the same time again that women are lifted up and men are told they don't matter see the article above. Moving on...
Yeah I didn't say anything about one night stands or casual sex other than briefly stating not what *I* am into. This is actually likely a side effect of the above. The men that are having sex, with this generation having sex at all time low rates, they have a large amount of suitors. Why be tied down when I don't have to? You told me yourself it is easy. Is that good for you no. But men are dumb.

This argument is used often but you yourself are making the inverse argument. Essentially saying yeah you are right men aren't needed. That's a pretty rough argument when you say 50% of people don't matter. Like you said sex can be satisfied easily. This is ignoring the companion component. The parts of relationship outside of sex, etc... Again like I said I think you are going to see women have significant amounts of depression when they turn 40/50 when they realize they can't have kids. That men probably aren't going to want them anymore because of that. By the way you want to know the biggest predicator of poverty in the world. Single motherhood. Greatest detriment to children lack of a two parent household. Turns out having parents together matters. In fact having a male father figure is extremely important like very. Basically what I am saying is Men matter and you should have a problem with how they are being seen, treated, etc...

Even if you aren't conventionally attractive as deemed in modern society there will still be people who are attracted to you as everyone's brains work differently.

,2105800,FormerlyFe(IV),"Aug 3, 2023 at 3:50 AM","I think that 50% of people not mattering is kinda dramatic. I have no interest in the dating pool, or even in the lives of, most Indonesian people, for example. But that doesn't really mean that Indonesian people don't matter. They do, but not to me.

I would never say that men don't matter, but companionship isn't the same must as it was in the past. A heck of a lot of women still seek companionship, heck, I just got ""rejected"" because I wanted something casual and the woman I was FWB with wanted something more serious. It's also true that companionship is finding other forms, with women having more professional and casual freedom they fulfill themselves in relationships that aren't romantic. Friends and family and pets and just romantic companionship (given the rise of the child-free philosophy) are sometimes enough.

Men, and dads, definitely do matter. I don't think otherwise. But I see that we're moving out of an old period, like up to the 70s, where society at large was very male-oriented. Feminism and social media and what not are empowering women to ""fight that back"". But also, just be themselves. I'd rather have a woman being happy single out there than one that feels pressured to have a family. I think this huge shift is scaring some people but it'll balance out eventually.


I honestly appreciate the well-thoughtout response , let me just say that. And not only is Pew reliable... I actually got distracted reading their report thinking of responding you. I also looked into the Daily Collegian, Brookings and Vox articles that you sent. Thanks.

While it doesn't really mention appearance and vanity, it is true that, according to that study, over half of women are finding it hard to find someone that meets their expectations, as vague as that is. And that the singles gap is actually bigger and more in line with the disparity of dating apps too, with more single women than men not looking for dates at all. I didn't actually think the difference was that big. I stand corrected. Online dating sucks more places than I imagined.


Call me a walking cognitive dissonance but I feel like the meaning of ""gender roles have switched"" and ""men being devalued"" feels very different than ""men/boys are being left behind in education"". The former feels like the gender roles were necessarily better in the past or that there is an active campaign against manhood. There is an active campaign for womenhood and yeah those stats are sad and worrying.

Especially since men complaining about our gender-specific issues aren't super in vogue right now. I think I remember agree with a Jordan Peterson (?) speech about this, how more teachers are now women and how they are treating girls more favorably in schools. It's a sad and yeah urgent systemic problem that I too wish was being discussed more often. Of course it's not that simple since there are so many other factors too (as your links do describe) but the imbalance is definitely there.

Not going to lie I find the university admission process in the US kinda weird. In Brazil we have kind of a nation-wide SAT and you just compete with other people interested in the university based off that score. Some universities have their own tests but they're almost all standardized or the cheap private colleges just let anyone in. The fact that applications that are judged on a case-by-case basis and also have to be actively non-judgemental or proactively inclusive is so weird.


I feel like we relatively agree on the stats and are approaching this from different angles. Maybe my dating experience (through friends/school/work, not online dating) is more optimistic and yours is understandably more pessimistic. I just don't like the almost antagonistic vibe I get sometimes.

I'm not going to jumble the numbers too much, but I still feel like it's possible to be relatively positive still. There is at least a 2-to-1 gender imbalance. That's still pretty good. You only need to be better than one average dude, and let's be honest, average dude can be pretty mediocre. There still are a large portion of the women dating that are finding success. It's a goddamn dumbass numbers game that everyone is playing, and I agree it's bullshit, and so does everyone else. But maybe it's not the end of the world.

I'm not sure how things get better other than hope. How do we make online dating and other experiences ""more human"" where big tech got us by the balls? I don't know. But love is still out there.",2105633,2105633,2105633,,,,,

Well....To answer your question, it exists, but there's almost no chance it will last for long....Besides love is a social construct anyways. There's just so much pressure to have a romantic relationship, and if you don't have one, regardless if you want to or don't want to, people immediately think that something is wrong with you for that, and eventually even you start to question that. Therefore, if you can't find someone, it's okay....They will show up eventually or it's also very much okay, to not have a romantic relationship whatsoever, because it's too painful anyway.",,,,,,,,

,2593654,thatisitguy,"Jul 12, 2024 at 4:30 AM","Hello -

The beginning of 2024 left me wondering how much longer I could go in life. I felt like I had three options - CTB, going back to prison or dying all by myself in some public hospice like my father did. Of the three, CTB was the best option. I made a deal with myself that I would try to straighten out my life before committing to CTB. I said the best I could was another year or two and I would CTB. Then I had been compromised in a bad situation where it's possible that I could go to prison for a very long time. So my timeline moved from 1.5 years to ASAP.

I read about SN and had no problem getting it. I decided to do a ""dry run"" by taking a few sips. The experience was not pleasant. I felt weak, ill and the vomiting was bad. True, I didn't take those extra steps of using antiemtics but I don't think it would had mitigated the experience. Then it hit me - why not just OD on opioids?

I used them recreationally for year. I did a ""dry run"" by taking 10 Lortabs, Nyquil and codeine at a nice hotel. I told myself that this was my reward. But it was a disguised attempt. I was watching a movie when it all hit me. I blacked out. That's never happened. I woke up hours later in the same position that I blacked out in with my laptop in my hands. It wasn't unpleasant. I thought what a great way to CTB. I asked my dealer if he could get me fentanyl and he said yes. I am hoping he pulls through. That is my method. From what I read, people who OD on fentanyl get high and then blackout. I can't think of a better way to go. The whole SN seems overbearing and I find ironic that it was easier to get than fentanyl. Once I secure it, I need to pick a date.

Isn't a fentanyl overdose way more easy, cheaper and pleasant than SN overdose? I am not sure what I am missing.",,,,,,,,
,2593658,Praestat_Mori,"Jul 12, 2024 at 4:45 AM","Welcome to the forum. SN is legal, with F you depend on your dealer, it's illegal, you also won't get pure F, you may only get street quality and F is often not easy to get hands on it. Your dealer doesn't want to kill you, he needs a recurring customer. I agree that drug/med ODs are more peaceful (that's my opinion) but they're usually harder to get than SN.

Edit: There's the Opiod Megathread:

Opioid Megathread & Overview

True, I don't know exactly what I am getting from my dealer. So far he's been delivering on Lortabs and is my only connection. I know it sounds illogical to kill your fentanyl buyers but that's what dealers have been doing for years. Street dealers probably aren't testing their product purity and are only concerned about making that sale at that moment. They don't really think long-term. They are not sophisticated for the most part. I think at the end of the day people react differently to different methods.

Then she bursts into my room lecturing me about something that doesnt matter to me at all and then continuing when I tell her to stop. Only leaving me alone after I tell her to leave for 10 times. And then I get the urge to cut myself and I did. A couple minutes my mom bursts into my room again wanting to talk about something that this time at least is relevant but It's late and I want to rest and she only leaves me again after I tell her for a minute straight to leave me alone and then she is pissed about it and kinda curses me while walking away. Now I got again an even stronger desire to cut myself, to even cut my thighs as much as I could. And I did cut my thighs so much that my underwear can now barely cover the scars. I realized over the past years, that nowadays I almost only cut myself or get the urge to do so after my mom talks to me. I wonder why. She is my mom and I love her, I think? At least I appreciate her taking care of me and supporting me. But still her voice, her tone, the way she talks (espesially when she is triggered) makes me want to cut myself so hard I often cannot resist it. And obviously I cant tell her this, so the only thing I can say to her when I dont want to hear her to leave me alone. I am a person who is mentally conflicted about cointless things, but this, even compared to the other things I do, seems so abnormal. Why does my mom trigger my self harm desire? And now again she is calm and talks to me in a suthing voice and It still makes me want to cut myself. But now I cut myself twice already today and I am so calmed by it so I wont do it again today. I feel so weird, like I am not a normal human, instead some kind of messy disaster that has failed everything they could fail. Thank you for reading this messy story/vent. I just had to express myself in some way and this site is the way for me",,,,,,,,

But just wanted to point out for your 2nd point- I did go for full assessment with the psychosis service and told truth (and I posted in another thread the referral form that detailed that main issues were shared with them - mind control , thoughts of harm to self/others, microchip etc.). They discharged me as said my symptoms aren't in keeping with psychosis.
I won't argue about my view but that was theirs . I have tried to get help but keep getting rejected by multiple services so evidence is mounting that I have to do the right thing.
I know people don't believe me about that but in UK people who are risk to others and self are often denied support, it's not uncommon. There are multiple cases recently in news where family and individual concerns were ignored and led to murders and suicides.
There are specific threats and they've followed through on them before so I believe them. Too many times to be a coincidence and they predicted things no one could've known.",2592630,2592633,,,,,,

It's unfortunate that there's not much you can do until the referral is sorted, but hopefully the relative that helped you will help keep up on it. Have you still not been sleeping?

Thank you for your understanding. I understand why people think I'm lying but I have genuinely been trying to get support.
No my relative had to chase it up again today. This receptionist was more helpful and apparently the person who was meant to contact Dr couple days ago went on annual leave without doing so . And they also shared that supposedly I wasn't discharged from MHP, she was supposed to do a review last month after the EIP referral (news to me). But anyway they've emailed the practitioner now to find out what's happening.
Yes trying not to sleep didn't last very long. I've calmed down about that, still feel the microchips but not so worried about more being put in now. My sleep isn't great but getting some every night at least.

,2594049,tired_tired_tired,"Jul 12, 2024 at 2:13 PM","Some backstory: I grew up in a poor but not poor family. It's me, my niece and her bf, my sister, and my mom living together. My mom is so financially unstable, she rather use money to buy her bf a new couch rather than pay rent, we're behind on rent and each of us have our own debt (mine is due to a fire during christmas time 2020 where we lost everything and didn't have renters insurance so had to rebuild life from scratch while only working $13 an hour. All we had was the clothes we were wearing, no family to stay with and red cross only kept us for 3 days so we all had to spend a lot to get a new place asap). I've been trying to pay mine off but I can't seem to progress with interest rates and in fall I have to start paying for college out of pocket because financial aid won't cover me anymore because I dropped out the first time I went to college and now I'm only part time. A lot of our financial burden is because my mom doesn't manage money well and my niece is high maintenance and they don't say no to her. Even while in debt they still rented a hall and dj to throw her a sweet 16 last year, which I'm happy for her and she deserves it but there are things like if she says she wants a new pair of jordons and we can barely afford food they'll still get her it.

My rant is, I have a lot of dietary health restrictions (diagnosed with ibs, chronic gastritis, gerd, allergic to milk, corn, and shellfish, and an eating disorder so it's hard to find things that I'll eat) so 95% of they food they make at home or have for snacks are stuff my niece and her bf eat, I can't have it cause they make me sick. I wake up at 5am to go to work then my 2nd job then college and I get home around 8pm or later so I don't have time/energy to cook for myself so I've been buying food out a lot which became very expensive. Eventually I started buying a protein yogurt for breakfast (it surprisingly didn't give me hives like regular yogurt) and I'd skip lunch and dinner and go to sleep hungry unless someone cooked something I can eat. There are times where I'd buy stuff for myself to leave in the kitchen to eat when I'm home but whenever I get home my niece and her boyfriend eats all of it. For example I was having period cravings so I bought a pint of dairy free ice cream and left it in the freezer unopened, the next day I get home and go to get it and it's gone they ate all of it. There was ice cream that they like in the fridge but they still ate mine. Sometimes I'd ubereats dinner and only eat half so I can have the other half the next day for dinner but when i get home from work they already ate it so I have to go to sleep hungry. This happens with everything I buy for myself and I brought this up to my mom and she told me to just be okay with it and I tried explaining that while it may seem like something trival but that one food I ordered and split into multiple meals is because that's all I can afford to do. She told me I'm not allowed to have boundaries because that's my niece. I can't speak to my niece about it cause then she has a bpd episode and self harms. A few days ago I bought a 5 containers of yogurt so i can have breakfast for the next few days since most days that's all I'll have for the entire day and last night I went into the fridge and there was only one left, the rest was gone.

It just feels so unfair, so many things in the kitchen they can have cause they don't have the health issues I have. I would never ask any of them to make/buy food that I can eat, I can buy it for myself but I can't afford to buy it for myself and still not have anything to eat. Why can't I just have the 1% of food I bought for myself. I understand it's good to share but I can't afford to, this is all I have. I wish I was able to have boundaries, I wish I had enough money to buy enough food so everyone else can have. It's so hard.",,,,,,,,

i only have plans to leave a sort of quick note in the form of a scheduled text/email to my sister asking her to alert authorities a day or two after i choose to CTB. maybe i could say, like, a final ""im sorry,"" and ""i love you"" and that kind of thing. but, i'd hardly consider that a ""suicide note"".

in fact i have little journals and notepads all over my house that describe how much pain im in and how anguished i am, how .. generally i feel that every moment is a sort of suffering, .. and part of my plans are to go around and make sure i get rid of aaall of that before i go. i would fucking hate for my sister to have to go through anything to decide if there's something worth keeping that she could find precious and end up with all this fucking horrible shit to sort. i know that she's the kind of person to parse through every notebook; just to .. cling, to anything that comes from my soul that's left over.. and, to be sure what to keep and what not to keep. i was an especially artistic person at one point, so i expect she'd be looking for some sort of doodles or any kind of creative writing or anything. but now all my expressions are very upsetting, and have been for so long. i assume even in a suicide note, it would devolve into some kind of horrible madness that borders on something psychotic. i think that it would be haunting and extra painful.

i pretty much always say too much.. so if i were to write a suicide note it would be a fucking novel... everyone else here mentioning ""one page"".. hah! i wish! good god. if i could be that brief, i might not want to die so terribly bad. i have been told i am ""too much"" by every person, so to give anyone anything more in my death would kill me again for a second time. i'd have to kill myself in my death, knowing i was troubling people so badly even in my death.

i feel like i have so many reasons not to want to even try to write a suicide note. hah.

but i'm very enamored and inspired by the people who are able to write any kind of nice or inspiring things for their loved ones. so there's a part of me that wants to do, .. like.. something. i have thoughts of making a little mix tape or something cheesy and simple and sweet. but i dont know. i imagine my time to ctb will be somewhat impulsive.

Buddhists believe that the human life is one of suffering, and that meditation, spiritual and physical labor, and good behavior are the ways to achieve enlightenment, or nirvana

Now having said that, it's generally considered morally wrong to wish suffering upon someone. But when we give birth, it's bringing new life into suffering.

I ordered SN as a backup. It was showing them as delayed for several
days, and I felt so defeated because this weekend is my best for my CTB date. But then today I got a notification today that it will arrive tomorrow. We'll see!

For the nitrogen, I got lucky and got it off a local used website from someone who was retiring from HVAC and was selling equipment I just said I was picking it up for my dad. I've also seen it on the biggest website for selling everything here in the US.
The jerky arm movements were like mild convulsions. It was hard to control my arms and arms wanted to move on their own.

I held on for a good 30-40 seconds. Breathing was easy, but my breath got rapid and shallow. I didn't feel like I was suffocating though.

There wasn't much pain, more an intense feeling of pulling the hood off that overtook me. Like a physiological panic. I don't know how to rate that. Not something I've experienced before.

,2593663,b_adr,"Jul 12, 2024 at 4:52 AM","Thank you for the answers! Haha, ""picking it up for my dad"" has been my pre-planned response as well in case of needing an explanation. But for some reason it feels so difficult to lie!

But regarding the feeling you got, it actually could be very likely it is purely psychological. I have been actually experiencing something similar - for the past few days I have been trying to obtain the appropriate anti-emetics for SN, which has not been easy. Accordingly, during the nights, my brain is super overwhelmed with unwelcomed thoughts of how it will physically feel to vomit from SN and experience aspiration of gastric contents (which I know will ultimately lead to pulmonary obstruction). This article depicts wonderful photos from lungs after SN suicide: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X2300094X At night, all of this information just freely floats around in my brain, and I noticed that I began to physically feel nauseated, up to a point where I went to the bathroom as I though I felt I will actually vomit (but I didn't). As ChatGPT explained to me, this is actually a real phenomena facilitated by the central nervous system. So psychological stimuli can evoke real physical responses. As for your case, I would definitely take something for sedation and convulsions. And I am hoping to obtain nitrogen and use it as my primary method, and I would likely combine it with phenobarbital. But, then again, I am scared that nitrogen method, too, could be faulty, as I have read an account of someone simply waking up after 10 hours or so, covered in vomit and urine. I hate this wide variety of accounts so much.

Not sure of the details of your plan, but make sure that the cylinder does not fall and that you have strapped yourself as well. And I get that it might be difficult to put off the CTB date, but I would rather put it off a bit and instead make sure I have appropriate medications (as I am not sure propranolol would be of great help).

Either way, I hope all goes peacefully for you.",2593286,,,,,,,

,2585132,PinballWizard39,"Jul 4, 2024 at 3:06 PM","Please excuse this potentially long post, I'm in a really shitty situation all because everything got a bit too heavy to carry and I ended up blurting out how bad things really are during a breakdown I had whilst with my care-co-ordinator (CC) yesterday.

Everything has been piling on top of me for a long time now, the crushing depression that never f*cks off for long. Meds not working, sh*t at work, money issues, not getting the help I actually need, planning my CTB plan. I have had to shut down and limit what I say to people that I usually would go to for support, purely because it's not like I can sit there and tell them how I plan to die, without them wanting to do something. Though saying that, I get ignored a lot when I try to get help for suicidal thoughts, so when that happens, I stop talking and it all goes underground.

Anyway, my situations is such now that everyone around me is admitting that there is no other help they can offer me therapy wise. I have over 25 years worth of trauma that I've been denied the proper treatment for over the years. Now the NHS funding is at an all time low, I really can't access anything now. 3/4 months ago I was told that I could have longer term trauma therapy for up to a year, and it was like I allowed myself to finally have some hope and I really started to pick up. However, when I went to the first appointment they told me it was only going to be 12 sessions. It was like someone stole what little hope I had and threw it out the window. Since then I've been meticulously planning my CTB plans because I know that even if my therapist wanted to offer me more help, he can't. They tell me to go private, which I can't because I have no money. Aside the therapist, who now has a bit more of a grasp about why I've been on about 12 sessions not being enough, everyone else just thinks I'm being dramatic. I have a history of physical, sexual and emotional abuse and neglect from my family, I've been in two relationships when I was mentally abused and sexually assaulted and raped on numerous occasions - 1 relationship was 6 months, the other was 9 years. I've barely been able to acknowledge or address the latter two. I have trauma from the way I've been mistreated by the MH team itself and as a result, I mistrust them all unless they show me otherwise. I don't think all that is going to be dealt with in 12 sessions.

Yesterday my CC asked me how my self harm thoughts were and I don't know why I did it, but I blurted out 'Bad, but not as bad as the suicidal thoughts'. Long story short, she knows I have a plan and a rough date in place but I refused to tell her what the plan was. She called the Home Treatment Team (HTT) and asked them to assess me. They came out today, assessed me, told me I'm not well enough for work at the moment, how they need to get the psychiatrist to check my meds (I'm taking myself off lithium slowly because it's not helping but because I've only just mentioned it to them, they are trying to blame my depression on that, which is p*ssing me off because I knew that would happen) and how they'll visit me daily for a bit.

I get the feeling, they aren't taking me seriously. When they asked why I wouldn't tell them what my plan was, I told them it was because I didn't want to be stopped. They replied saying ' Well if you're determined to do it, there's nothing we can really do to stop you'. That should be comforting in a weird way, but all I heard was 'Yeah, we don't care.' I have agreed to work with them, but I don't know why. I've told them there's nothing they can do. They said there's potentially a fund they can apply for for private help because the help I need, they can't offer, but I stopped them talking because I said don't you dare try and get my hopes up because I cannot afford for it to be taken away again.

I don't know how I feel. In some ways the pressure of all that I've been carrying has released a little bit, but at the same time, I feel like I've just exposed myself for no reason. Like I've said on here before, I don't want to die, but I have no other choice. I know I could easily say all the right things to the HTT and they'll have me discharged ASAP and even if they don't, they only stay involved for 2 weeks max, so it'll be back to me, myself and my plans soon enough. I'm surprised they even agreed to see me in the first instance. I wonder if they'd take me any more seriously if they knew the lengths I've gone through to make my plan - come to this website to find people who can relate and help me find a way to end my pain, order SN, suffer paranoia that I'd be welfare checked, - all of it. This is the furthest I have even gone in a mission to ensure a suicide plan would work. In some ways, the embarrassment that I have fallen this low in myself and done these things, keeps me from admitting it. (Not saying that anyone needs to be embarrassed, this is just how I feel about myself). I desperately want them to give me some kind of hope, but I know they can't, and even if they tried, I can't trust anything.

I'm so sorry for this being so long, I appreciate you reading.",,,,,,,,
,2585201,byebyeblondie,"Jul 4, 2024 at 4:10 PM","Hello,

I'm sorry you've been through so much.

I am from the UK and can relate to the struggle with support through the NHS and I (personally) think the HTT are a waste of space. I found they were inconsistent with who visits, they had no clue what was going and it was incredibly stressful having to go through everything each time a new person visited; they usually brought a surprise student with them and asked as they were walking into my house if they were okay to come in and I also got the impression most of them couldn't give a flying crap.

Also annoys me that they offer therapy based on 6-12 sessions … agree that it's hardly enough! It's like you just start to open up and explore things but your sessions have ended, so you're back to being on your own to deal with reopened wounds.

Have you ever tried the acute therapy service? Not sure if it's offered all over the UK but near where I am it's a week long programme (I know it's short term) but it's really helpful. I've done it twice; it's offered as alternative to being sectioned. You have to be referred but the HTT can arrange it.

Also, I obviously don't know your financial situation but you could look at applying for PIP? That could help with medical bills if you chose to try the private sector.

It seems like you still have some hope and would like the help and support to move forward.

I really hope you can get some ongoing and meaningful support.",,,,,,,,

I did apply for pip, they called me in for a face to face and still they awarded me 0 points across the board. I've currently asked for a mandatory reconsideration but I doubt much with come from that and then I'll have to go to tribunal..

I would like help and support to actually start living and 'recovering' - whatever the hell that is, but at the same time, it's not there and so I really don't have any hope. All I get offered are things to help me 'cope' with my illnesses. I'm not interested in just coping anymore. This is breaking point.
Medications don't help, I've been on so many that I'm now deemed 'treatment resistant'. I'm nearly 40 and I've dragged myself through uni, fought back from brain damage and the edge of death caused by anorexia, ran marathons, climbed literal mountains, fundraisers, ran support groups - anything that might help me feel better and improve my life - nothing has worked.

I was trying to talk to a psychiatrist earlier today to see if they could give me access to Klonopin or some sort of benzo to make passing with SN easier. Unfortunately they said no and Gave me a blood pressure medication instead.,2589778,,,,,,,

The team are coming to see me later today and I'm just going to straight up say that I need something to knock me out. Last time I was with their crisis team, the psych put me on quetiapine short term, which helped, but I stopped taking it due to increased appetite and weight gain. I really need something similar to that as apposed to benzos. The team are saying they don't have access to a psych atm (which makes zero sense to me as they are the bloody psychiatric crisis team!) which is why I have to wait another week to see the community one. The team must be able to do something surely. They said on the phone last night that they might be able to liase with the psych before next week at least, but we'll see. I'm getting confused and a bit overwhelmed with the amount of different people I'm having to talk with, the plans we make and then don't happen because they don't come back and don't pass the messages on..

I was going to write this elsewhere, but I thought I'd put it here instead, as it's relevant.

I'm genuinely wondering.. could the pressure/stress, whatever, of finding a way to CTB and accrue all you need, whilst not telling a soul and not really wanting to die (but you don't have a choice) and leading a kind of double life, make you ill in itself? I mean that I have been suicidal a lot in the past, made plans, etc etc, but I've never gone to this degree or trouble. I have noticed that i'm feeling more unwell in my head as it progresses, not just depression or PTSD wise or whatever, but in a 'this is not normal behaviour' - 'or is it? My thoughts don't feel quite right and I'm questioning everything and I don't feel right in myself (even by my standards). This isn't normal for me and I guess I wondered if there was enough stress, it could cause stuff like this.",2591359,,,,,,,
,2591385,fleetingnight,"Jul 10, 2024 at 4:11 AM","Of course I'm no expert, but yeah, I definitely think it's possible

There's already a ton of pressure in trying to accept your own death, I think it's harder the closer you get and the more ""real"" it becomes. Having to keep up a facade is always exhausting, it adds even more to deal with. And the stakes feel pretty high, which is stressful

I envy the people who can think deeply about death without getting uncomfortable or scared, but I know that most people can't. Of course, I don't think it's wrong to think about death and suicide, but since our natural instinct is to try and survive no matter what, it's definitely unnatural, so it's probably a bit straining to think about.

I'm still with the HTT team. It's been really difficult because some of them are OK, some really aren't. None of them are even bringing up what happened with my injuries, more that they are ignoring it unless I bring it up. I find that slightly strange considering how serious it is. Maybe it's better we just ignore the elephant in the room when they visit.
I had to go back to the plastic surgery trauma clinic are the same hospital I work at today (awkward because the last thing I want is to bump into my colleagues). My leg is pretty bad but because of the travel back and forth there, they're getting me to change my own dressings every day at home and then go see them again in a week. The HTT said to call them to check in with them after I got back today and when I did, because there is always different people, they were asking why I was calling in. When I said for a check-in, we spoke for a bit but then they said they were busy and had to go, and that they wouldn't be in touch til Sunday now because of being busy.

I'm feeling them pulling back away from me now. They tend to do this right before they tell you you're being discharged. I'm assuming they are going to wait til I've seen the psych on Tuesday, and then discharge me. Regardless of whether they carry on or they discharge me, I still feel the same. I still have the same thoughts of CTB. If anything, talking about it with them in a 'general' manner, has turned the pressure down in my head, and left me more calm about CTB. I still don't want to do it, but I still don't have any other option.

I spoke with my CC yesterday, which was actually OK. Between her and my therapist, I am starting to feel like they are beginning to 'get it' and treat me more like a human being and less of just some kind of mental case. It's just really sad that my therapist is only about for another 2 weeks, and between them, they are stuck from helping properly because of lack of services.
I agreed to take my old quetiapine from now until my appt with psych so that I can at least try to get some rest from my brain.

TOXBASE access,2309470,CocoToxBase,"Jan 9, 2024 at 6:41 AM","There's every single gases out there so if you pick a specific one I'll copy and paste for you! Below is nitrogen.

Nitrogen
Toxic Substance

Type of Product
Colourless, odourless gas which constitutes 78% of the atmosphere. Used as an inert gas for preservation and as an aerosol propellant. Used in liquid form for freezing and in cryosurgery.

Synonyms
CAS 7727-37-9
N 1066 (gas)
UN 1977 (cryogenic liquid)

Ingredients
Nitrogen

Toxicity
Nitrogen is a simple asphyxiant at high concentrations. Liquid nitrogen has a boiling point of -195 degrees centigrade. When warmed, liquid nitrogen will vaporise and may rapidly expand to displace room oxygen. This has lead to numerous reports of asphyxiation and death, often in lab workers. Breathing in high concentrations of nitrogen has been used as a suicide method.

Following ingestion, rapid expansion of liquid nitrogen to 700 times its volume as nitrogen gas in the stomach may result in gastric perforation. Rupture may be seen adjacent to the lesser curvature of the stomach. Oesophageal perforation is also possible.

NPIS is aware of a case where liquid nitrogen added to a cocktail resulted in perforation and pneumoperitoneum requiring gastrectomy. An 18-year-old girl developed sudden perforation of the stomach (over the lesser curve) following ingestion of an alcoholic drink containing liquid nitrogen (used for aesthetic effect). She needed total gastrectomy with Roux-en Y reconstruction.

Patients are likely to need urgent surgical review and intervention.

Features
Skin contact with liquid nitrogen can cause frostbite and burns. Mucosal injury may occur after ingestion of liquid nitrogen due to local necrosis.
Neuropathy, syncope and cardiac arrest have been reported following cryosurgery using liquid nitrogen.
Ingestion of even small amounts of liquid nitrogen may result in immediate abdominal pain, vomiting, belching, dyspnoea, gastric distension and perforation (due to marked volume expansion during conversion to gas). Gas embolism and convulsions are also possible. Ingestion may also cause CNS depression.
Inhalation of high concentrations may produce rapid unconsciousness leading to cardiac arrest and death.
Inhalation of liquid nitrogen may damage the pharynx (severe mucosal injury), resulting in asphyxia.
At high concentrations and pressures (such as in deep sea diving), nitrogen may cause drowsiness.
Isopropyl Nitrite
Highly toxic substance


Type of Product
Yellow highly volatile liquid; used as a recreational drug of abuse. Used for aphrodisiac and vasodilator effects. Sold as 'room deodorisers'.

Synonyms
Specifically for isopropyl nitrite:
Buzz; nitrous acid isopropyl ester; nitrous acid 1-methyl-ethyl ester; 2-propanol nitrite
CAS 541-42-4

Caution: using a slang term to try and identify a drug of abuse is potentially dangerous since there are many regional variations and the terms change over time.

Ingredients
Isopropyl nitrite

Toxicity
Toxicity may occur via absorption through the lungs, GI tract, skin and mucosae.
Alkyl nitrites are vasodilators which also oxidise ferrous iron (Fe2+) to ferric iron (Fe3+) in haemoglobin to produce methaemoglobin that reduces oxygen carrying capacity of red blood cells.
Toxic features may appear within seconds of inhalation are usually moderate and short-lived. Features usually occur within 1 hour of ingestion and may last up to 12 hours. Clinical features reflect vasodilatation and, in more severe cases, methaemoglobinaemia (with apparent cyanosis, hypoxia, CNS depression etc). For more information on methaemoglobinaemia click here.

A 2-year-old child developed altered mental status and cyanosis after suspected ingestion of 'Rush' nail polish remover, containing a nitrite compound. He was diagnosed with methaemoglobinaemia (due to laboratory error quantification was not possible) and treated with IV methylene blue. He was discharged on hospital day 2.
Several cases of progressive loss in visual acuity have been reported following chronic inhalation of ""poppers"" containing isopropyl nitrite. Improvements in visual acuity were noted several months after discontinuing use.

Two pharmaceutical workers who inhaled isopropyl nitrite developed headache, dizziness and flushing. However, respiratory complications and methaemoglobinaemia did not occur.

A 34-year-old man injected poppers containing isopropyl nitrite intravenously for recreational purposes. He presented to hospital with dyspnoea, oxygen saturation of 82% and a MetHb of 40%, and was treated with tolonium chloride and non-invasive ventilation. He was discharged after a 24-hour observation.

Features
The two main features are hypotension and methaemoglobinaemia, which can develop rapidly over minutes with nitrites but may be delayed with nitrates, occurring after 12 hours.
Methaemoglobinaemia (elevated MetHb) can be present in apparently insignificant exposures and may lead to severe clinical features. Patients with MetHb concentrations greater than 7-10% appear to have central cyanosis (often grey peripheries and brownish mucous membranes). Blood drawn by venepuncture may appear dark brown in colour.
Finger probe pulse oximetry and some point of care blood gas analysers may provide unreliable results in the presence of methaemoglobinaemia and administration of oxygen may not increase finger probe oxygen saturations.
Click here for more information on methaemoglobinaemia
Other features include GI upset (if ingested), blurred vision, xanthopsia, sweating, chills, throat irritation, dyspnoea, headache, dizziness, and agitation.
More severe features may include tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory depression, coma, convulsions, and death.
Haemolysis can also occur and is more likely in patients with G6PD deficiency.

Eyes: Visual loss associated with retinal toxicity has been reported with isopropyl nitrite containing poppers but appears rare. This may resolve over several weeks after stopping exposure. Vapours may produce transient lacrimation and stinging. Splashes in the eye usually cause only mild irritation but corneal damage has been reported.
Recreational use: abuse of alkyl nitrites causes contact and allergic dermatitis particularly around the nose and lips. Prolonged contact with the skin can cause systemic features. As these chemicals are flammable, thermal burns have occurred.
Due to the irritant nature of nitrite compounds, haemoptysis and respiratory complications including severe tracheobronchitis can occur with chronic inhalation or regular abuse.
Explosions: Burns and systemic toxicity have occurred after dermal contact following explosive trauma with ammonium nitrate.",2309425,2309356,,,,,,

TOXBASE access,2309502,CocoToxBase,"Jan 9, 2024 at 7:29 AM","Carbon Monoxide (CO, synonym for carbon monoxide)
Toxic substance

Type of Product
A colourless, odourless, flammable gas formed by incomplete combustion of carbon containing products such as diesel oils, petroleum products, domestic gas or solid fuels, including charcoal.
Any source of combustion where oxygen supply, and/or removal of waste combustion products are inadequate may produce carbon monoxide.
Stoves, heaters, boilers, fires and portable fuel burners are all potential sources. Faulty flues from gas appliances are a common source of exposure. Poisoning may be more common during the winter months.
Carbon monoxide poisoning has also been reported after prolonged smoking of shisha/hooka water pipes, from the use of barbecues in enclosed areas such as tents, indoor use of petroleum generators and from stored wood pellets used to fuel boilers.
Carbon monoxide is also available in compressed gas cylinders for industrial use.
Other sources of carbon monoxide include ingestion or inhalation of methylene chloride.
NOTE: Leaks of domestic gas do NOT involve carbon monoxide.

Synonyms
CO
CAS 630-08-0
UN 1016 - Carbon monoxide, compressed
UN 9202 - Carbon monoxide, refrigerated liquid (cryogenic liquid)

Toxicity
Highly toxic.
Carbon monoxide binds haemoglobin and reduces oxygen carrying capacity, causing severe tissue hypoxia. It also causes direct injury through inhibition of cytochrome oxidase. Poisoning usually occurs through inhalation of carbon monoxide, although carbon monoxide produced by catabolism of ingested or inhaled methylene chloride may also cause carbon monoxide poisoning.
A faulty central heating boiler led to 60 adults being exposed to carbon monoxide during a church service, with 22 being transferred to hospital for assessment and treatment with high flow oxygen. 17 patients had carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) concentrations greater than 10%, highest 35%. One patient suffered a myocardial infarction. Seven experienced neuropsychiatric problems, including depression, apathy, irritability and poor concentration. Three patients described persistent symptoms.

Ten boys (age 14-16 years) were inadvertently exposed when their scuba diving tanks were contaminated with high levels of carbon monoxide. One patient became unconscious with a COHb concentration of 32.8%. This patient also developed gross pulmonary oedema and a CT-head indicated generalised brain swelling with diffuse hypodensity in the white matter. He recovered completely following ventilation with 100% oxygen and high positive –end expiratory pressures.

Five further patients had headache and nausea and initial COHb concentrations ranging from 6.2-20.6%. Four asymptomatic patients had initial COHb concentrations ranging from (0.4-12.5%). Troponin –T concentrations were raised in 2 of the patients and CK concentrations were raised in all of the symptomatic patients. All patients were found to be well at 2 month follow-up.

The use of faulty new Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) powered racing karts led to admission of seven patients with carbon monoxide poisoning. The majority of those attending displayed symptoms of vomiting and dizziness; one person was said to have subsequently collapsed and several had difficulty walking. COHb concentrations of between 14.1% and 18.3% were recorded around 2-3 hours after the race ended. Several other users of the Go-Karts had experienced symptoms consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning.

Non-smokers will typically have a baseline COHb concentration of 1-2%. In smokers this baseline will be raised (5-10%).
The half-life of COHb is 320 minutes breathing air. This can be reduced to 80 minutes breathing 100% oxygen. A further reduction of half-life to around 40 minutes has been reported from the use of high flow nasal cannulae to deliver oxygen at up to 60 L/min.
Workplace exposure limits (excludes underground mining/tunnelling industry):
Long-term UK workplace exposure limit (8 hours): 20 ppm (23 mg/m3)
Short-term UK workplace exposure limit (15 mins): 100 ppm (117 mg/m3)

Features
Acute poisoning
Headache, nausea and vomiting, irritability, weakness and tachypnoea followed by dizziness, confusion, ataxia, agitation, syncope, hypotension, seizures, impairment of consciousness and respiratory failure. Cerebral oedema and metabolic acidosis may develop in serious cases.
Less common features include skin blisters, rhabdomyolysis, compartment syndrome, acute renal failure, pulmonary oedema, dysrhythmias, myocardial infarction, retinal haemorrhages, cortical blindness, choreoathetosis, mutism and hearing loss. Cherry red skin colour is rarely seen.
An initial carboxyhaemoglobin (COHb) concentration above 30% is likely to be associated with severe poisoning.
Commonly reported symptoms

90%
Nausea and vomiting
50%
Vertigo
50%
Alteration in consciousness
30%
Subjective weakness

Delayed features
The majority of people exposed to carbon monoxide will recover uneventfully, but delayed neuropsychiatric features (DNS) may develop. Features include memory impairment, disorientation, apathy, mutism, irritability, inability to concentrate, personality change, emotional lability, neuropathy, incontinence, chorea, apraxia, psychosis, dementia and Parkinsonism. Later features may be delayed by up to 40 days. Patients considered at higher risk are those who have experienced severe poisoning (e.g. unconsciousness etc).

Chronic poisoning
Chronic carbon monoxide poisoning is frequently misdiagnosed or undiagnosed since the features are non specific. Features include headache, lethargy, nausea, memory problems and flu-like symptoms. The diagnosis should be considered particularly if there are other members of the same house experiencing similar symptoms

Measurement of carbon monoxide concentrations
Breath: These are typically used in smoking cessation programmes. Diagnosis of CO poisoning in this manner is not frequently reported however high concentrations of exhaled carbon monoxide suggests excess CO exposure. Smokers will have elevated concentrations (breath concentrations up to 70 ppm, equivalent to ca.12% COHb have occasionally been recorded immediately after smoking a cigarette). Obtain an urgent blood sample for analysis of COHb in patients with elevated breath CO.

CO-Pulse oximetry: If pulse-oximetry is used to measure COHb concentrations, ensure it is a CO-pulse oximetersince regular oximeters cannot distinguish different forms of haemoglobin.

Patients should be advised on measures to avoid further exposure by excluding potential sources of CO.

Skin contact with rapidly released compressed CO may cause cold burns.

Public Health / Diagnosis
Ensure that the source of CO in the home has been identified and dealt with by appropriate engineers/specialists. This will help prevent further exposures to the patient(s) and others. The following guidance will assist with patient diagnosis and also considers CO sources within the home.

Pre-Hospital Management
Administer oxygen in as high a concentration as possible (10-15/L min with trauma mask and non-rebreathing bag). Where available, consider the use of nasal high flow cannulae to deliver oxygen at up to 60 L/min.
On arrival at hospital, ensure that high-flow oxygen is continued during the patient's wait and triage.
Patients with suspected CO poisoning should continue to receive high-flow oxygen until CO poisoning has been excluded.

Management
If not already initiated pre-hospital patients should be placed urgently on high flow oxygen (see below, point 3) irrespective of oxygen saturations until carboxyhaemoglobin level is available and carbon monoxide poisoning excluded.",2309496,,,,,,,

N,N-diethyl-2-[[4-(1-methylethoxy)phenyl]methyl]-5-nitro-1H-benzimidazole-1-ethanamine (Isotonitazene
Highly toxic substance

Type of Product
A drug of abuse. A synthetic µ-opioid receptor agonist.

Caution: using a slang term /abbreviation to try and identify a drug of abuse is potentially dangerous since there are many regional variations and the terms change over time.

Ingredients
N,N-diethyl-2-[[4-(1-methylethoxy)phenyl]methyl]-5-nitro-1H-benzimidazole-1-ethanamine

Caution: exact ingredients may vary. Different products will have different compositions. The label may not accurately reflect the contents.


Caution: the purity of the ingredients in recreational drugs may vary greatly.

Toxicity
This is a newly identified psychoactive substance. Limited information is available on the effects of this substance.
Isotonitazene is a synthetic opioid analgesic. It is a member of the benzimidazole family of opioids which includes etonitazene, a potent internationally controlled opioid analgesic.
Data suggests that isotonitazene may be a potent opioid in humans (Blanckaert et al, 2019); the most serious acute health risk from isotonitazene is likely to be respiratory depression, which in overdose could lead to apnoea, respiratory arrest, and death.
Isotonitazene has been identified in Belgium, Estonia, Germany, Latvia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. Germany and the UK have each reported a single death involving isotonitazene. No further details are currently available.
Isotonitazene has been identified in 3 deaths in Canada. Isotonitazene was also identified along with one or more other psychoactive substance in at least 18 deaths in the USA (August 2019 - January 2020). Many of the cases involved the use of other CNS depressants along with isotonitazene (such as other opioids and/or benzodiazepines).

There are concerns that isotonitazene has been used to fortify heroin preparations in the UK and that this may have caused unexpected severe toxicity and deaths, however investigations are ongoing.

Opioids cause toxicity via agonism at opioid receptors, centrally and peripherally. The principal features of respiratory depression (with hypercapnoea) and reduced consciousness/coma (with airway obstruction leading to hypoxia and death) are mediated by μ (mu) and κ (kappa) opioid receptors respectively. Other typical features include meiosis, hypotension, reduced GI tract motility, non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, nausea and vomiting. Opioid pyrolysate inhalation may lead to toxic leukoencephalopathy.
Duration of action varies markedly from ~2.5 hours for fentanyl to up to 18 hours for methadone. Note that this duration of action may be longer than that of competitive antagonists such as naloxone with a risk of recrudescence of toxicity on discontinuation of antidote. It is not possible to distinguish different opioids by clinical features alone other than broadly by duration of action.

Highly potent opioids may require high doses of naloxone to reverse toxicity although the protocol of incremental titration to clinical response remains most appropriate.
Many opioids are hepatically metabolised and renally excreted.

Please discuss individual cases with your local poisons information service.

Features
Severe opioid toxicity produces depression of the respiratory and central nervous systems and pin-point pupils. If untreated the depression of the level of consciousness can lead to deep coma, convulsions and respiratory arrest.
Effects in overdose will be potentiated by co-ingestion of alcohol and other centrally acting drugs.
Effects will appear very rapidly after exposure to high-potency opioid drugs (e.g. veterinary sedating agents like etorphine).
Severe and recurrent respiratory depression can occur after ingestion of transdermal patches.
Milder opioid toxicity may produce nausea, vomiting, nightmares, anxiety, agitation, euphoria, dysphoria, depression, paranoia and hallucinations. While pin-point pupils are often present, this is not a reliable clinical sign and their absence does not exclude opioid toxicity. Sedation may be associated with hypotension, bradycardia and hypothermia.
Toxic leukoencephalopathy has been reported following recreational use of heroin, methadone, oxycodone and buprenorphine. Malignant cerebellar oedema and raised intracranial pressure has been reported in one child following unintentional dihydrocodeine ingestion.
For certain opioids (such as morphine, diamorphine, codeine and pethidine), the risk of toxicity is significantly increased if kidney function is impaired due to reduced elimination of the parent opioid or active metabolite.
Opioids, in particular codeine, can cause histamine release, causing urticaria and pruritis. Non-cardiac pulmonary oedema and rhabdomyolysis may occur after intravenous injection of opioid analgesics.
Some opioids may cause cardiotoxicity e.g. methadone, which causes potassium channel blockade and QT prolongation or dextropropoxyphene, which causes sodium channel blockade and QRS prolongation.
Co-administration of opioids with serotonergic agents such as SSRIs, SNRIs, MAOIs etc. may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome. For more information click here. For the management of serotonin syndrome click here.
The route of opioid administration may produce important clinical features such as soft-tissue infections and abscesses at the sites of intravenous heroin injection. The presence of infections distant to the injection site should also be specifically determined (for example, endocarditis, lung abscesses). Inadvertent intra-arterial injection can cause severe limb ischaemia.
The possibility of viral hepatitis and HIV infection should be considered in all intravenous drug users and testing should be routinely offered or recommended.
Rarely, sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSHL) has been reported following opioid overdose. Recovery of hearing has been reported in some cases.

Fentanyl
Highly toxic substance

Type of Product
A drug of abuse. A synthetic µ-opioid receptor agonist.

Caution: using a slang term /abbreviation to try and identify a drug of abuse is potentially dangerous since there are many regional variations and the terms change over time.

Caution: exact ingredients may vary. Different products will have different compositions. The label may not accurately reflect the contents.

Caution: the purity of the ingredients in recreational drugs may vary greatly.

Toxicity
The most serious toxic features are respiratory depression, hypercapnoea, reduced consciousness/coma and airway obstruction, mediated by mu and kappa opioid receptor agonism. These effects will be potentiated by simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other sedative drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines, xylazine); reversibility with naloxone will be reduced in these situations.

The time to onset of effects for opioids varies according to route. Intravenous and smoking use leads to effects in under 1 minute, intramuscular, subcutaneous or insufflation use leads to effects within 20 minutes; while oral ingestion can take up to 90 minutes for effects to occur. Nausea, vomiting and delayed gastric emptying slow oral onset.

Reduced consciousness, respiratory depression, miosis and cardiac arrest have been reported following fentanyl exposure (with concomitant exposure to other drugs, including via nasal spray.

fentanyl use has been associated with diffuse alveolar haemorrhage in one case.
Recreational use of heroin laced with fentanyl has been rising rapidly and is associated with an increase in opioid-related deaths in North America. Currently fentanyl or its analogues are rarely found in samples from those presenting with heroin toxicity in the UK.
This fentanyl analogue was not detected in any of 140 patients presenting to participating Emergency Departments in the UK with suspected severe heroin toxicity since 2017.",,,,,,,,

A white to yellow-white odourless solid with a salty taste. Used as a pharmaceutical precursor, meat and fish curing agent (E250), corrosion inhibitor and in the manufacture of azo dyes. Also used as an antidote in cyanide poisoning.

Synonyms
Nitrous acid, sodium salt, erinitrit, filmerine
E250
CAS 7632-00-0
UN 1500
EC 231-555-9

Toxicity
May be highly toxic – as little as a single 1 g tablet has been fatal. Mechanism of toxicity is mainly via methaemoglobinaemia and nitric oxide induced vasodilation.
Oral exposure is most common, but one fatality has been reported following extensive dermal exposure.
Sodium nitrite poisoning has been occasionally reported following antifreeze ingestion.
Sodium nitrite is readily absorbed from the gut; methaemoglobinaemia can occur within a few minutes but may be delayed for 45 minutes or more after exposure.
Decomposition may produce irritating, corrosive and/or toxic gases with an explosion hazard.

Whole blood nitrite is almost completely converted to nitrate within an hour and largely eliminated in the urine.

A 17-year-old dental nurse died after ingestion of 1 tablet of sodium nitrite. Fifteen minutes after admission to A&E she vomited, aspirated and suffered a respiratory arrest. A blood sample indicated severe methaemoglobinaemia and she was administered IV methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue) (2 mg/kg over 10 minutes). Her blood pressure was unrecordable and following a series of cardiac dysrhythmias she died despite the insertion of a temporary pacing wire.

A 29-year-old male ingested 20-22 g of sodium nitrite in a suicide attempt and experienced severe metHb (91%) and haemolysis. He required intubation, activated charcoal and approximately 4 mg/kg methylthioninium chloride in total. He recovered uneventfully and was discharged on day 2 without sequelae.

Features
The two main features are hypotension and methaemoglobinaemia, which can develop rapidly over minutes with nitrites but may be delayed with nitrates, occurring after 12 hours.
Methaemoglobinaemia (elevated MetHb) can be present in apparently insignificant exposures and may lead to severe clinical features. Patients with MetHb concentrations greater than 7-10% appear to have central cyanosis (often grey peripheries and brownish mucous membranes). Blood drawn by venepuncture may appear dark brown in colour.
Finger probe pulse oximetry and some point of care blood gas analysers may provide unreliable results in the presence of methaemoglobinaemia and administration of oxygen may not increase finger probe oxygen saturations.

Other features include GI upset (if ingested), blurred vision, xanthopsia, sweating, chills, throat irritation, dyspnoea, headache, dizziness, and agitation.
More severe features may include tachycardia, hypotension, hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, respiratory depression, coma, convulsions, and death.
Haemolysis can also occur and is more likely in patients with G6PD deficiency.
Eyes: Visual loss associated with retinal toxicity has been reported with isopropyl nitrite containing poppers but appears rare. This may resolve over several weeks after stopping exposure. Vapours may produce transient lacrimation and stinging. Splashes in the eye usually cause only mild irritation but corneal damage has been reported.
Recreational use: abuse of alkyl nitrites causes contact and allergic dermatitis particularly around the nose and lips. Prolonged contact with the skin can cause systemic features. As these chemicals are flammable, thermal burns have occurred.
Due to the irritant nature of nitrite compounds, haemoptysis and respiratory complications including severe tracheobronchitis can occur with chronic inhalation or regular abuse.
Explosions: Burns and systemic toxicity have occurred after dermal contact following explosive trauma with ammonium nitrate.

Management
Remove from exposure where possible. Remove all soiled clothing. Once stabilised, wash contaminated areas thoroughly with soap and water.
1.
Maintain a clear airway and ensure adequate ventilation.
2. If the patient is cyanosed administer high flow oxygen and measure methaemoglobin (MetHb) concentration urgently (see below).
Finger probe pulse oximetry and some point of care blood gas analysers may provide unreliable results in the presence of methaemoglobinaemia and administration of oxygen may not increase finger probe oxygen saturations.
pO2 and oxygen saturations underestimate oxygenation in methaemoglobinaemia.
3. The benefit of gastric decontamination using activated charcoal is uncertain. Consider activated charcoal (charcoal dose: 50 g for adults; 1 g/kg for children) if the patient presents within 1 hour of ingestion of any amount providing it is safe to do so and the airway can be protected. Efficacy declines rapidly with time since ingestion but there may be some potential benefit from later use, especially following ingestion of highly toxic substances.
4. Monitor vital signs and check the capillary blood glucose.
Check and record pupil size.
Pulse oximetry is unreliable in the presence of methaemoglobinaemia.
5. Perform a 12-lead ECG in all patients who require assessment.
Repeat 12-lead ECGs are recommended, especially in symptomatic patients or in those who have ingested sustained release preparations.
6. All patients who require assessment should be observed for at least 6 hours after exposure. Asymptomatic patients can then be considered for discharge with advice to return if symptoms develop.
7. In symptomatic or cyanosed patients check arterial blood gases, methaemoglobin concentration, FBC, U&Es, and LFTs.
8. Methaemoglobinaemia
In symptomatic or cyanosed patients measure the methaemoglobin (MetHb) concentration urgently; usually available on point of care blood gas analysers. Blood samples for MetHb measurement should be analysed as soon as possible after collection.
Administration of oxygen may not increase finger probe oxygen saturations.

For adults and children aged 3 months and older:
Severe life-threatening cases
(click here for features of methaemoglobinaemia) Administer high flow oxygen.
Do not delay treatment if MetHb concentration is not available or delayed.
Administer methylthioninium chloride 2 mg/kg diluted in 100 mL of 5% glucose IV over 5 minutes
(0.4 mL/kg of 50 mg/10mL methylthioninium chloride solution for injection OR
0.2 mL/kg of 50 mg/5mL methylthioninium chloride solution for injection)
If treatment with methylthioninium chloride is ineffective or contraindicated, immediate administration of O-negative red cells to increase oxygen carrying capacity of blood or exchange transfusion should be considered.
Methaemoglobin concentration ≥ 45% Administer high flow oxygen.
Administer methylthioninium chloride 2 mg/kg diluted in 100 mL of 5% glucose IV over 5 minutes
(0.4 mL/kg of 50 mg/10mL methylthioninium chloride solution for injection OR
0.2 mL/kg of 50 mg/5mL methylthioninium chloride solution for injection)
Do not delay treatment if MetHb concentration is not available or delayed
If treatment with methylthioninium chloride is ineffective or contraindicated, exchange transfusion should be considered. If this is not available, consider immediate administration of O-negative red cells to increase oxygen carrying capacity of blood.
Methaemoglobin concentration 30 – 45% Administer high flow oxygen.
Administer methylthioninium chloride 1 mg/kg diluted in 100 mL of 5% glucose IV over 5 minutes
(0.2 mL/kg of 50 mg/10mL methylthioninium chloride solution for injection OR
0.1 mL/kg of 50 mg/5mL methylthioninium chloride solution for injection)
Methaemoglobin concentration < 30% but the patient has hypoxic symptoms
(click here for features of methaemoglobinaemia)
NB: Pre-existing conditions may increase susceptibility to tissue hypoxia at lower methaemoglobinaemia concentrations (e.g. anaemia, pulmonary disease, heart failure)
Administer high flow oxygen.
Administer methylthioninium chloride 1 mg/kg diluted in 100 mL of 5% glucose IV over 5 minutes
(0.2 mL/kg of 50 mg/10mL methylthioninium chloride solution for injection OR
0.1 mL/kg of 50 mg/5mL methylthioninium chloride solution for injection)
Methaemoglobin concentration < 30% without symptoms Administer high flow oxygen.
Repeat MetHb concentration in 30 minutes
If MetHb concentration does not reduce and/or patient develops hypoxic symptoms (click here for features of methaemoglobinaemia), then consider methylthioninium chloride 1 mg/kg diluted in 100 mL of 5% glucose IV over 5 minutes
(0.2 mL/kg of 50 mg/10mL methylthioninium chloride solution for injection OR
0.1 mL/kg of 50 mg/5mL methylthioninium chloride solution for injection)

Repeat the MetHb concentration after 30 minutes. If no response to treatment, repeat the dose of methylthioninium chloride. Then continue to monitor MetHb concentration every 30-60 minutes after therapy to assess effectiveness, or sooner if cyanosis recurs. Note that methaemoglobinaemia may recur and further treatment may be required.

Dosing can be complicated and methylthioninium chloride doses in excess of 4 mg/kg should not be given without prior discussion with NPIS.

Click here for help preparing and administering the correct dose and for further information if treatment with methylthioninium chloride is ineffective or contraindicated.

All patients who have been administered methylthioninium chloride should be monitored for at least 6 hours after features have resolved.

Hypotension
Ensure adequate fluid resuscitation.

Consider early referral to critical care for patients with fluid-resistant hypotension, as these patients can deteriorate extremely rapidly; the management of children with fluid-resistant hypotension should be overseen by an experienced paediatrician.

Invasive vascular monitoring and echocardiography may help determine the likely relative benefits of inotropes and vasopressors because reduced cardiac output and vasodilation often co-exist in severe or mixed poisoning.

There have been very occasional reports of worsening of hypotension associated with adrenaline treatment, thought to be due to beta-receptor agonist effects.

Vasopressors and inotropes can be initiated in an emergency through peripheral venous access but only under the direction of an experienced physician. Click here for further advice on doses.

Convulsions
Give oxygen; check blood glucose, U&Es, calcium, magnesium, phosphate and blood gases. Correct acid base and metabolic disturbances as required.

Single brief convulsions do not require treatment.

Control convulsions that are frequent or prolonged with intravenous diazepam (10-20 mg in adults; 0.1-0.3 mg/kg body weight in children), lorazepam (4 mg in adults; 0.1 mg/kg in children), or midazolam (5-10 mg in adults; 0.05-0.15 mg/kg in children).

Further doses of benzodiazepines may be needed in adults; refer to intensive care. In children seek consultant paediatric input.

If unresponsive to the above measures, the patient should be referred urgently to critical care. The NPIS recommends barbiturates as second line therapy and avoidance of phenytoin.

Metabolic acidosis
If metabolic acidosis persists despite correction of hypoxia and adequate fluid resuscitation consider correction with intravenous sodium bicarbonate. Ensure serum potassium is within normal range as administration of sodium bicarbonate may worsen hypokalaemia.

Adults: an initial dose of 50-100 mmol sodium bicarbonate (e.g. 50-100 mL 8.4% or 100-200 mL 4.2%) may be given and repeated as necessary, guided by arterial blood gas monitoring, aiming for a normal pH. The volumes for different concentrations of sodium bicarbonate to achieve a dose of 50-100 mmol in adults are shown here.

Children: Give 1-2 mmol/kg sodium bicarbonate (1-2 mL/kg 8.4% or 2-4 mL/kg 4.2%) over 20 minutes. Repeat as necessary, aiming for a normal pH.

Since 4.2% and 8.4% bicarbonate are irritant to veins, and can rarely cause local necrosis in cases of extravasation, administer into a large vein (or via a central line where possible). A bolus should be preceded and followed by a large flush to confirm cannula position and to reduce local contact.

Adults and children: Recheck acid base status after administration of sodium bicarbonate. For severe acidosis, large amounts of bicarbonate with repeated pH checking may be required to correct the metabolic acidosis.

Carisoprodol
Toxic substance

Type of Product
A muscle relaxant. Precursor to meprobamate. Mechanism of action unknown but thought to be centrally acting.
Carisoprodol (Carisoma) is a centrally acting muscle relaxant used in the short term as an adjunct to the symptomatic treatment of acute musculoskeletal disorders associated with painful muscle spasm. Carisoprodol is associated with increased risk of abuse, addiction, intoxication, and psychomotor impairment. There are safer alternatives to carisoprodol for the management of acute musculoskeletal disorders. A phased withdrawal of carisoprodol from the UK market will take place. Meprobamate is closely related to carisoprodol and has a similar balance of risks and benefits. The MHRA is therefore exploring a phased withdrawal of this medicine in the UK
The marketing authorisation for carisoprodol was suspended in September 2009 due to an increased risk of abuse and addiction, as well as the risk of altered mental state and psychomotor impairment.

Ingredients
Carisoprodol
Tablets - 125 mg, 350 mg

Toxicity
Carisoprodol's mechanism of action is unknown; it is a precursor for meprobamate, which is thought to have benzodiazepine-like effects. It is used as a drug of abuse.
In adults, ingestions of 21 g and 35 g have resulted in respiratory failure and coma. Ingestions of 8-10 g produced little more than drowsiness, dizziness and impaired coordination in some patients; however, 9 g resulted in coma in one patient.

A 4-year-old died after ingesting 3.5 g and 700 mg caused severe CNS depression and respiratory depression with hypoxia in a 2-year-old.

A 34-year-old male patient with a history of carisoprodol abuse developed severe CNS and respiratory depression following an acute ingestion of 7.5 g. He subsequently required high doses of multiple sedatives to control agitation; this was thought to be due to carisoprodol withdrawal. He was extubated 10 days post admission and self-discharged 16 days post admission.

In a case series of 34 patients, 88% disclosed they were abusing opiates together with carisoprodol to increase the desired opioid effect. An acute dose of 10 tablets or more of carisoprodol was associated with more severe side effects such as confusion and partial amnesia.
Serotonin toxicity has been reported following ingestion of carisoprodol.
Peak plasma concentrations occur after 1.5 to 2 hours. The terminal elimination half-life in therapeutic use is about 2 hours. Carisoprodol is substantially metabolised to meprobamate and in overdose serum meprobamate concentrations are likely to be raised.

Features
CNS - drowsiness leading to coma which can be deep and prolonged. Slurred speech, ataxia, headache, weakness, hyperreflexia, clonus, convulsions and respiratory depression may occur.
Cardiac - hypotension, tachycardia and cardiac dysrhythmias have been reported.
Other features - GI upset, hypothermia and pulmonary oedema may occur. Agranulocytosis and pancreatitis have been reported. Acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis may occur. Blisters (erythematous or haemorrhagic) may occur, particularly at pressure points.
Bezoars have been reported following meprobamate ingestion.
Serotonin toxicity has been reported following ingestion of carisoprodol of which meprobamate is the main metabolite. Click here for further information.
Co-ingestion of alcohol and other central nervous system depressants may potentiate the effects of meprobamate and may increase toxicity.",2310573,,,,,,,

Toxic substance

Type of Product
Short acting nonbenzodiazepine GABAA agonist hypnotic agent used in the short-term treatment of insomnia. Zopiclone has sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant and muscle-relaxant actions.

Ingredients
Zopiclone
Tablets - 3.75 mg, 7.5 mg

Toxicity
The primary toxicity of zopiclone is CNS depression and is likely to be potentiated when co ingested with alcohol or other CNS depressants.
In elderly people with pulmonary impairment due to lung cancer doses of 90 mg and 200–350 mg have proven fatal.
Methaemoglobinaemia, renal failure, and/or haemolytic anaemia have all been reported following zopiclone ingestions of greater than 375 mg.
Zopiclone is rapidly absorbed with peak levels within 1.5-2 hours. The therapeutic half-life of zopiclone and its metabolite is 3.5-6 hours increased to about 8 hours in cirrhotic and elderly patients.

Features
In mild cases, drowsiness, confusion and lethargy are seen.
In more serious cases GI upset, ataxia, psychosis, bradycardia, prolonged QT, hypotension, methaemoglobinaemia, acute kidney injury, haemolytic anaemia, hypotonia, respiratory depression and coma may occur.
Hypoventilation and non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema, probably secondary to hypoxia, occur rarely. This may then lead to respiratory failure and death in severe cases.
The effects will be potentiated by simultaneous ingestion of sedating cold and flu preparations, alcohol or other psychotropic drugs.",2310621,,,,,,,

Caution: exact ingredients may vary. Different products will have different compositions. The label may not accurately reflect the contents.

Caution: the purity of the ingredients in recreational drugs may vary greatly.

Toxicity
Limited information is available on the effects of this class of psychoactive substances.
Several nitazenes have been detected in the UK including isotonitazene which has been linked to multiple deaths since it was identified in 2019.

Nitazenes are highly active at µ-opioid receptors in in vitro assays, with the potency and efficacy of several analogues equal to or exceeding that of fentanyl.

There are concerns that nitazenes have been used to fortify heroin preparations in the UK and that this may have caused unexpected severe toxicity and deaths. More recently, multiple heroin seizures in the UK have been adulterated with nitazenes.

Several members of this group of substances have been associated with deaths, click here for further information.

The most serious toxic features are respiratory depression, hypercapnoea, reduced consciousness/coma and airway obstruction, mediated by mu and kappa opioid receptor agonism. These effects will be potentiated by simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other sedative drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines, xylazine); reversibility with naloxone will be reduced in these situations.

The time to onset of effects for opioids varies according to route. Intravenous and smoking use leads to effects in under 1 minute, intramuscular, subcutaneous or insufflation use leads to effects within 20 minutes; while oral ingestion can take up to 90 minutes for effects to occur. Nausea, vomiting and delayed gastric emptying slow oral onset.",2319796,,,,,,,

Ingredients
Isoniazid
Tablets - 50 mg, 100 mg
Injection (2 mL amp) - 25 mg/mL
Also available in the following combined preparations; please refer to the specific TOXBASE entry for the following:
Rifater (rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide)

Rimstar (rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol hydrochloride)
Voractiv (rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide + ethambutol hydrochloride)

Toxicity
Acute isoniazid toxicity results mainly from functional deficiency of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) and the consequently limiting ""pyridoxine-dependent"" reactions, including the synthesis of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid). In addition, isoniazid inhibits glutamic acid decarboxylase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to GABA.

Metabolic acidosis in acute isoniazid toxicity is primarily related to seizure activity causing lactate production. However, isoniazid may also inhibit the conversion of lactate to pyruvate.

Ingestion of over 80 mg/kg has been reported as fatal.
Prolonged seizure activity, metabolic acidosis and raised deranged liver enzymes were reported in 3 adolescents who ingested between 40 mg/kg – 160 mg/kg of isoniazid in acute overdose. They were treated with pyridoxine and benzodiazepines. Seizure activity resolved after 6 hours in 1 patient and after 1 day in 2 patients. Liver enzymes remained elevated for at least 7 days in all 3 patients. They all made a complete recovery.

A 32-year-old man developed coma and recurrent seizures after ingesting 12 g isoniazid. He was treated with pyridoxine and haemodialysis, recovering consciousness after 3 days. He had no persisting toxic features.

A 20-year-old woman was admitted with recurrent seizures following ingestion of 25 g isoniazid. Following multiple doses of pyridoxine (14 mg) and midazolam she was intubated and ventilated and started on high-volume continuous venovenous haemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) 5.5 hours after the ingestion. She was extubated after 24 hours and CVVHDF was stopped 6 hours later. The patient made a full recovery and was discharged 4 days post admission.

A 7-year-old who ingested 3 g (125 mg/kg) isoniazid developed coma and metabolic acidosis which persisted despite the administration of 6 g of pyridoxine but resolved following haemodialysis.

A 68-year-old man with end-stage renal disease and latent tuberculosis was admitted with accidental therapeutic excess of isoniazid over a 2-week period. He was drowsy, tremulous and had a lactic acidosis. Within a few hours he developed features of fulminant hepatic failure with encephalopathy, haematemesis, deranged enzymes and a raised INR. His isoniazid was withheld and he was treated with vitamin K and FFP. Pyridoxine was not administered. He did not require intubation and was discharged 8 days post admission.

Isoniazid is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. Peak plasma concentrations occur within 1-2 hours of ingestion. The plasma half-life ranges between 1 to 6 hours, with shorter half-lives in rapid acetylators dependent on genetic phenotype.

Features
Initial symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, rash, fever, ataxia, slurring of speech, dizziness and stupor.
Severe poisoning is associated with a triad of coma, convulsions, and lactic acidosis. Convulsions can be prolonged, and present as status epilepticus refractory to the usual anticonvulsants. Coma may develop even in the absence of convulsions and may also be prolonged.
Other features of severe toxicity include hypotension, respiratory depression, rhabdomyolysis, acute liver failure and acute kidney injury. Hyperglycaemia and glycosuria are common and may be confused with diabetic emergencies.
Lorazepam
Toxic substance

Type of Product
A benzodiazepine used for sedation and treatment of status epilepticus.

Ingredients
Lorazepam
Tablets – 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2.5 mg
Injection (1 mL amp) - 2 mg/mL, 4 mg/mL
Oral solution (60 mL and 150 mL bottles) - 1 mg/mL

Toxicity
The primary toxicity of benzodiazepines is CNS depression; the effects are potentially more severe when co-ingested with alcohol and other CNS depressants.

Three children ingested between 2.5 mg and 25 mg and developed ataxia, lethargy and hallucinations.

Lorazepam solution contains propylene glycol as an excipient and may cause metabolic acidosis, hyperosmolality and acute kidney injury from propylene glycol accumulation after continuous infusions.

Peak plasma concentrations occur about 2 hours after an oral therapeutic dose. The elimination half-life is about 12 hours.

When given by intramuscular injection, peak plasma concentrations occur after 60-90 minutes. The elimination half-life of a therapeutic dose is about 12-16 hours when given intramuscularly or intravenously.

Features
Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Coma, hypotension, bradycardia and respiratory depression occasionally occur but are seldom serious if these drugs are taken alone. Coma usually lasts only a few hours but may be prolonged in elderly patients.
Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease. Severe effects in overdose also include rhabdomyolysis and hypothermia.

ECG abnormalities include transient first degree and second degree block and QT prolongation. Abnormal LFTs may also occur.
Microembolisation can result from intravenous injection of crushed tablets. Accidental intra-arterial injection of benzodiazepines can cause severe limb ischaemia and gangrene necessitating limb amputation.

Co-ingestion of alcohol and other central nervous system depressants potentiates the effects of benzodiazepines and can increase toxicity.

Clonazepam
Toxic substance

Type of Product
A benzodiazepine used for the treatment of epilepsy and panic disorders.

Ingredients
Clonazepam
Tablets - 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg
Oral solution (150 mL container) - 0.5 mg/5 mL, 2 mg/5 mL (contains either 65 mg/5 mL (Thame) or 100 mg/5 mL (Rosemont) ethanol as an excipient depending on brand)

Toxicity
The primary toxicity of benzodiazepines is CNS depression; the effects are potentially more severe when co-ingested with alcohol and other CNS depressants.

A 4-year-old developed cyclical coma lasting for 24 hours and recovered within 36 hours.

A 4-year-old boy who was unresponsive following an ingestion of clonazepam was found to have first degree AV block (PR 206 ms) on presentation. This changed to second degree AV block (Mobitz type 2) following flumazenil administration. ECG abnormalities resolved 16 hours after presentation.

QTc prolongation has been reported in a 30-month-old girl who was admitted with drowsiness and loss of consciousness following clonazepam overdose.

Peak plasma concentrations occur within 1-4 hours of an oral dose. The elimination half-life following therapeutic doses is between 20 and 60 hours, mean 30 hours.

If large amounts of the oral solution are ingested there may be features of ethanol toxicity, but the major toxic risk is likely to be due to clonazepam.

NOTE Combination products with paracetamol or aspirin are available. Please consult the relevant TOXBASE entry.

Toxicity
The most common toxicity includes extrapyramidal effects such as acute dystonias which may occur even at therapeutic doses, particularly in children, young adults and the very old. Poor CYP2D6 metabolisers (Chua et al, 2019; Akbuga-Ozel, 2017) and pregnant women (Chua et al, 2019) may also be at risk of developing acute dystonias.
A 62-year-old female developed severe bradycardia then asystolic cardio-respiratory arrest within one minute of a 10 mg IV injection of metoclopramide (Rumore et al, 2011). Spontaneous circulation recovered following chest compressions and she was transferred to intensive care where she developed SVT. She ultimately made a full recovery. Several other cases of bradycardia and cardio-respiratory arrest following IV metoclopramide have been reported in the literature (Rodrigues et al, 2019).
A metoclopramide-induced acute hypertensive crisis complicated by multi organ injury, myocardial infarction and acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring vvECMO was observed in a 36-year-old woman with pheochromocytoma (Leonard et al, 2018).
Severe extrapyramidal symptoms have been reported in a 4.5-month-old infant who received 15 mg (2 mg/kg) metoclopramide over 12 hours (Sahin et al, 2001) and in a 6-month-old child who received 3 mg/kg metoclopramide over 9 hours (Batts & Munter, 1998). In both cases, symptoms resolved with supportive care.
A 3-week-old male infant became cyanotic, lethargic and irritable after receiving an iatrogenic overdose of metoclopramide (6 mg/kg over 36 hours) for the treatment of suspected gastroesophageal reflux. Methaemoglobinaemia (20.5%) resolved following a single intravenous dose of methylthioninium chloride (Kearns & Fiser, 1988).
Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported in a 58-year-old man with C. difficile diarrhoea after ingestion of 50 mg metoclopramide over 3 days. He recovered with supportive care (Supariwala et al, 2011).
Serotonin toxicity has rarely been described following exposure to metoclopramide. A 19-month-old child developed seemingly overlapping symptoms of both neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin toxicity following oral therapeutic dosing (Aussedat et al, 2020). A 40-year-old woman developed serotonin toxicity after an IM injection of metoclopramide (Harada et al, 2017).
After oral administration of a therapeutic dose, peak plasma concentrations of metoclopramide occur after 1 to 2 hours. The elimination half-life is 4-6 hours (Martindale, 2010), which may be prolonged (up to 19 hours) in patients with impaired renal function and in infants. A half-life of 23 hours has been reported in a 3-week-old infant (Kearns et al, 1988).

Features
Acute dystonic reactions such as oculogyric crises, spasmodic torticollis, trismus and sensation of tongue swelling are the commonest features. They are most likely in children and young or pregnant women and may occur at therapeutic doses. Extrapyramidal features usually resolve after drug discontinuation although symptoms may persist for up to 36 hours.
Bradycardia, hypotension, ECG abnormalities (including QT prolongation), and cardio-respiratory arrest have been reported following IV administration. Metoclopramide may induce acute hypertensive crises in patients with pheochromocytoma.
Headache, dizziness, drowsiness, decreased conscious level, confusion, hallucinations and convulsions have been reported.
Methaemoglobinaemia has rarely been reported in neonates and infants. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported after therapeutic use and overdose.
Co-ingestion of alcohol and other central nervous system depressants may potentiate the sedative effect of metoclopramide.
Although rare, serotonin toxicity has been reported and may occur alongside acute dystonic reactions, particularly in patients on other serotonergic medications.
If taken with other serotonergic agents there is a greater risk of serotonin toxicity.

Domperidone

Type of Product
Selective peripheral dopamine antagonist at the D2 dopamine receptor. Used for control of nausea and vomiting. Domperidone has also been used to increase breast milk production in lactating women (unlicenced indication).

Ingredients
Domperidone
Tablets - 10 mg
Orodispersible tablets - 10 mg
Oral suspension (100 or 200 mL bottle) - 1 mg/mL

Toxicity
Domperidone may cause cardiac potassium channel blockade resulting in QT prolongation and torsade de pointes. It may cross the blood brain barrier, especially in infants and young children, and occasionally cause acute dystonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome due to antagonist actions at central dopamine D2 receptors.
A 69-year-old man who was receiving chemotherapy with bleomycin, cisplatin and methotrexate for oesophageal cancer developed ventricular fibrillation and died after an IV bolus of 100 mg domperidone (Joss et al, 1982). Lower doses of IV domperidone (50 mg and 20 mg) have been associated with ventricular arrhythmias in the context of hypokalaemia (Roussak & Carey 1984). Of four chemotherapy patients given domperidone 20 mg IV bolus, followed by 10 mg/kg over 24 hours, one developed ventricular tachycardia; potassium concentration was 2.9 mmol/l at the time (Osborne et al, 1985).
A 3-month-old infant was accidentally given 50 mg domperidone and developed dystonic eye and limb movements, persistent tachycardia and hyperkalaemia with ECG showing SVT. Features resolved after 36 hours of supportive treatments (Sanklecha & Charde, 2013).
Domperidone is rapidly absorbed with peak plasma concentrations occurring approximately 60 minutes after ingestion (in fasting subjects). The therapeutic plasma half-life is 7-9 hours following oral administration (this may be prolonged in hepatic and renal insufficiency) (Motilium SPC, 2021).

Features
Clinical features include dry mouth, GI upset, fatigue, drowsiness, dizziness, anxiety, extrapyramidal symptoms. Convulsions, coma and neuroleptic malignant syndrome may occur.
Intravenous boluses given to patients with pre-existing heart conditions, hypocalcaemia or undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy have resulted in cardiac arrhythmias, convulsions, cardiac and respiratory arrest and death.
Midazolam
Type of Product
A short-acting benzodiazepine used for sedation and treatment of seizures.

Ingredients
Midazolam
Buccal liquid - 5 mg/mL (0.5 mL vial, 1 mL vial, 1.5 mL vial, 2 mL vial)
Oral mucosal solution - 2 mg/mL (5 mL amp), 5 mg/mL (7.5 mL in 15 mL bottle)
Oral mucosal solution (in pre-filled oral syringe) - 5 mg/mL (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg syringes), 10 mg/mL (1 mL)
Buccal liquid - 10 mg/mL (1 mL vial)
Injection - 1 mg/mL (2 mL amp, 5 mL amp, 5 mL pre-filled syringe)
Injection - 2 mg/mL (5 mL amp)
Injection - 5 mg/mL (1 mL amp, 2 mL amp, 3 mL amp, 5 mL amp, 10 mL amp)
Solution for Infusion - 1 mg/mL, 2 mg/mL (25 mL and 50 mL vials)
Nasal spray - 2.5 mg, 3.75 mg, 5 mg (single-dose containers, available in Ireland)

Toxicity
The primary toxicity of benzodiazepines is CNS depression; the effects are potentially more severe when co-ingested with alcohol and other CNS depressants.
Fatal accidental iatrogenic midazolam overdose has been reported (Michalodimitrakis et al, 1999).
A term baby sedated on intensive care with midazolam for 32 hours and morphine for 62 hours remained unresponsive until day 5 following discontinuation and recovered fully by day 7 (Gupta et al, 2013).
Midazolam is absorbed rapidly following oromucosal administration and intramuscular injection. Extensive first-pass metabolism results in a low systemic bioavailability following ingestion (Martindale, 2011). The elimination half-life following therapeutic doses in healthy volunteers is 1.5-2.5 hours (Midazolam SPC, 2018).

Features
Benzodiazepines commonly cause drowsiness, ataxia, dysarthria and nystagmus. Coma, hypotension, bradycardia and respiratory depression occasionally occur but are seldom serious if these drugs are taken alone. Coma usually lasts only a few hours but may be prolonged in elderly patients.
Benzodiazepine respiratory depressant effects are more serious in patients with chronic obstructive airways disease. Severe effects in overdose also include rhabdomyolysis and hypothermia.
ECG abnormalities include transient first degree and second degree block and QT prolongation. Abnormal LFTs may also occur.
Microembolisation can result from intravenous injection of crushed tablets. Accidental intra-arterial injection of benzodiazepines can cause severe limb ischaemia and gangrene necessitating limb amputation.
Co-ingestion of alcohol and other central nervous system depressants potentiates the effects of benzodiazepines and can increase toxicity.
Propranolol

Type of Product
Non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker with sodium-channel blocking properties.

Ingredients
Propranolol
Tablets - 10 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg, 160 mg
Oral solution - 5 mg/5 mL, 10 mg/5 mL, 40 mg/5 mL, 50 mg/5 mL
Sustained release capsules - 80 mg, 160 mg

Toxicity
Severe toxicity in overdose is from blockade of sodium-channels (similar to severe tricyclic antidepressant poisoning) and blockade of beta-adrenergic receptors (similar to beta-blocker poisoning). Propranolol is lipid soluble so will also penetrate the CNS to cause convulsions or coma.
Individual response varies greatly. Death has followed ingestion of about 2 g (Suarez et al, 1988) and survival after ingestion of 8 g (Tynan et al, 1981).
In one case series the smallest dose which caused symptoms in a child was 5 mg/kg (Belson et al, 2001).
A 7-month-old infant who had accidentally been administered propranolol 6 mg/kg three times daily instead of 0.6 mg/kg three times daily for the treatment of scalp haemangioma developed tachypnoea and lethargy. On arrival in the ED oxygen saturation varied from 96% to 100% on room air, ECG showed sinus bradycardia (62 beats/min versus normal of 100-150 beats/min). Treatment included intravenous fluid boluses of 0.9% sodium chloride and high dose insulin, dextrose, and intravenous lipid emulsion. Following completion of these treatments, haemodynamic stability was regained. The infant was observed in PICU and discharged home the following day (Thompson et al 2016).
A 24-year-old female who ingested 7360 mg of propranolol developed wide QRS, coma, hypotension, VF, VT and multiple PEA arrests despite 100 mL 8.4% sodium bicarbonate, isoprenaline, adrenaline and glucagon. After a second dose of 300 mL of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate she stabilised and returned to a narrow complex sinus rhythm (Shanker et al, 2003).
Risk of convulsions is higher with propranolol than the other beta-blockers (Mokhlesi et al, 2003).
Peak plasma concentrations occur after 1-2 hours. The half-life in therapeutic use is about 3-6 hours but may increase to 10-20 hours with the modified release preparation (Propranolol 160mg SR capsules SPC, 2020).

Features
Key features in severe poisoning are cardiovascular collapse, CNS depression and convulsions.
Cardiac - QRS widening on ECG, hypotension, bradycardias and other arrhythmias including 1st – 3rd degree AV block. May produce VF, VT, or asystole in severe poisoning.
Development of cardiovascular complications is more likely if other cardioactive drugs, especially calcium channel blockers, digoxin, cyclic antidepressants or neuroleptics have also been ingested. The elderly and those with underlying ischaemic heart disease are at risk of developing severe cardiovascular compromise. Clinical features common to cardiac/cardiotoxic agents involved in mixed overdoses may be more severe or prolonged.
CNS - drowsiness, confusion, convulsions, hallucinations, dilated pupils and in severe cases coma. Neurological signs such as coma or absence of pupil reactivity are unreliable prognostic indicators during resuscitation or assessment of brain death.
Other - bronchospasm, pulmonary oedema and hyperkalaemia are possible.
Butaniol Highly Toxic Substance

Type of Product
GHB and its analogues (GBL, 1,4-BD, GVL and GHV) are sedative drugs of abuse, which are also used as body-building agents.
Sodium oxybate is a liquid preparation of the GHB sodium salt, used in the treatment of narcolepsy. It is available as a 500 mg/mL oral solution, under the brand name Xyrem.
GBL and 1,4-BD are metabolised to GHB. They are organic industrial solvents found in products such as acetone-free nail polish removers, paint strippers, cleaning products, and glue debonders.
Gamma-hydroxyvaleric (GHV) is a 4-methyl-substituted analogue of GHB, reported to be a direct GABA receptor agonist. Gamma-valerolactone (GVL) is a precursor of GHV.

Ingredients
GHB sodium salt is a white solid. It dissolves in water to form a clear, colourless and often tasteless liquid. It is presented as either a liquid or a powder (loose, or as tablets/capsules).
GBL and 1,4-BD are colourless liquids. They can be obtained from commercially available solvents.

Caution: the purity of the ingredients in recreational drugs may vary greatly.

Toxicity
GHB occurs endogenously in the brain at low concentrations. It is an agonist at GABA-B and GHB receptors (Busardò & Jones, 2015).
GBL and 1,4-BD are precursors for GHB. The latter may cause delayed toxicity when co-ingested with alcohol due to enzyme inhibition and delayed conversion of 1,4-BD to GHB (Schneidereit, 2000). High anion gap metabolic acidosis with raised anion gap has been reported following overdose of 1,4-butanediol (Stefani & Roberts, 2020).
GHB is rapidly absorbed from the gut with peak effects occurring 30-60 minutes post-ingestion. GHB is metabolised to carbon dioxide and water. The elimination half-life is between 20-60 minutes and prolonged in patients with hepatic impairment (Schep et al, 2012).
Severe clinical features may occur due to:
• Acute toxicity
• Severe withdrawal reactions after dose-reduction or abstinence following prolonged use
Click here for information on cases.
Features of acute toxicity include CNS and respiratory depression, hypersalivation, bradycardia and hypotension. Clinical effects are potentiated by ethanol, benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and other CNS depressants, including some co-ingested recreational drugs.

Click here for further details on clinical features and management of toxicity due to GHB and analogues.
Features of withdrawal include severe agitation, hallucinations, insomnia, tachycardia and hypertension.

Click here for further details on clinical features and management of withdrawal from GHB and analogues.
Diphenhydramine
Type of Product
A 1st generation sedating anti-H1 antihistamine with sodium and potassium channel blocking activity. Used in the treatment of allergic conditions, as a sleep aid, and in cold and flu combinations.
Diphenhydramine is also abused for sedative and hallucinogenic effects.

Ingredients
Diphenhydramine
Tablets - 25 mg, 50 mg
Oral Solution - 2 mg/mL
Cream - 2% w/w
May be found as an active ingredient in combination products - please see specific TOXBASE entry for details.

Toxicity
Toxicity manifests principally as sedation and central and peripheral anticholinergic features. Severe cardiotoxicity is also possible due to sodium channel blockade.
Following overdose in adults, moderate features (agitation, hallucinations, ECG abnormalities) have been associated with ingestions of greater than 300 mg and severe features (delirium, convulsions, coma) associated with doses greater than 1 g diphenhydramine (Radovanovic et al, 2000).
A retrospective study of 863 patients in the US found that acidosis, a raised anion gap and a prolonged QRS were the symptoms most associated with a severe outcome after ingestion of diphenhydramine. Severe outcomes were defined as the development of convulsions, ventricular dysrhythmias or intubation, 15.6% (n=135) of patients developed one or more severe outcome with convulsions being the most common (occurred in 98 cases (11.6%)). Three deaths were reported and all had one or more severe outcome prior to death (Hughes et al, 2021).
A 29-year-old male ingested 25 g of diphenhydramine and developed coma, convulsions and Brugada pattern ECG. He was treated with sodium bicarbonate and ventilation and subsequently recovered fully (Levine & Lovecchio, 2010).
A retrospective study of 42 adult and paediatric ingestions of diphenhydramine found that there was an increased risk of QRS prolongation and cardiotoxicity among patients who had ingested more than 1.5 g (Hughes & Hendrickson, 2018).
A 33-year-old male developed coma, tonic-clonic seizures, cardiac arrest and died after ingestion of 4.9 g of diphenhydramine (Yu et al, 2016).
A 23-year-old male who ingested up to 2.5 g developed cardiotoxicity with prolonged QRS (172 msec) and QTc (577 msec) and hypotension, recurrent convulsions and lactic acidosis. He underwent DC cardioversion and was treated with sodium bicarbonate and intralipid before the broad complex tachycardia resolved and he made a complete recovery (Abdi et al, 2014).
Young children can be more sensitive to the effects of overdose. Doses greater than 10 mg/kg have been reported to produce severe toxicity (Scharman et al, 2006) with five fatalities reported to be associated with diphenhydramine administration (Baker et al, 2003).
A 13-month-old child was admitted following a convulsion after being found with an empty bottle of diphenhydramine and 24 x 25 mg missing tablets. She had dilated pupils, nystagmus and altered mental status. ECG showed sinus tachycardia with a prolonged QRS duration of 130 ms. The ECG normalised following sodium bicarbonate therapy (Cole et al, 2011).
Few data are available regarding absorption of topically applied diphenhydramine; however, toxicity in children has been reported (Huston et al 1990; Turner, 2009). In the most serious case, a 17-month-old child died following use of a topical diphenhydramine cream; autopsy results showed the child's blood contained 20 times the normal therapeutic dose.
After therapeutic doses, peak plasma concentrations occur at 1-4 hours and the elimination half-life ranges from 2.4-9.3 hours (Martindale, 2019). Diphenhydramine is an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and interactions can occur following usage of drugs metabolised by this system (Nytol Original SPC, 2019).

Features
Key features include sedation and anti-cholinergic effects.
Peripheral anticholinergic effects include flushing, dilated pupils, blurred vision, dry mouth and tongue, hot dry skin, fever, decreased gastric motility and urinary retention. There may also be transient bradycardia followed by sinus tachycardia, hypertension, nausea, vomiting and tachypnoea.
Central anticholinergic effects include ataxia, delirium, agitation, aggression, visual and auditory hallucinations, speech disorders, convulsions, myoclonus, hypertonia and hyperthermia. In severe cases CNS excitation may give way to CNS depression, circulatory and respiratory failure and coma.
Other cardiac features may include cardiac conduction abnormalities including QRS and QT prolongation, ventricular dysrhythmias including torsade de pointes, ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest can occur.
Other features may include paralytic ileus, hyperglycaemia, rash and glaucoma. Abnormal liver and renal function and rhabdomyolysis have also been reported. Patients who have been unconscious may be hypothermic.
Less commonly than anticholinergic toxicity, serotonin toxicity may occur; click here for features and management .
Clinical features common to cardiac/cardiotoxic agents involved in mixed overdoses may be more severe or prolonged.
Features may also be prolonged due to continued drug absorption from a pharmacobezoar in the gastrointestinal tract.

Ethylene Glycol Highly Toxic Substance

Type of Product
Antifreeze, coolant, brake fluid etc. A clear, viscous fluid with a sweetish taste. When used as an antifreeze it may be coloured with dye.

Synonyms
1,2-dihydroxyethane, 2-hydroxyethanol, ethylene alcohol, ethylene dihydrate, EG, glycol, glycol alcohol, glycolmonomer, MEG, monoethylene glycol.
CAS 107-21-1

Ingredients
Ethylene Glycol (1,2-Ethanediol)

Toxicity
Highly toxic. Ethylene glycol is an alcohol and will cause features of intoxication. However, its main toxicity follows its metabolism to glycolaldehyde then to glycolic, glyoxylic and oxalic acids. Glycolic acid is cleared by the kidney and is largely responsible for the marked acidosis seen in severe cases. There is increasing evidence that calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals are the cause of renal failure and cerebral oedema.
Patients initially show a high osmolar gap as they absorb the alcohol; thereafter, their osmolar gap falls and their anion gap rises as the ethylene glycol is metabolised to glycolic, glyoxylic and oxalic acids (see features section below). Antidotes are required to prevent this production of toxic metabolites (see management section below). Early treatment with an antidote will minimise toxicity.
The fatal dose for a 70 kg adult is approximately 100 g of ethylene glycol (about 90 mL of pure ethylene glycol). Concentrations vary in different commercial products and are usually expressed as a percentage. Click here for approximate amount of ethylene glycol in commercial preparations.
Inhalation and skin absorption are not serious hazards.
Ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed from the gut. Peak concentrations occur 1 to 4 hours after ingestion.

Features
Typically, after a brief period of inebriation due to the intoxicating effect of ethylene glycol itself, metabolic acidosis develops, followed by tachypnoea, coma, convulsions, hypertension, the appearance of pulmonary infiltrates and oliguric renal failure. If untreated, death from multi-organ failure usually occurs 24 to 36 hours after ingestion.
The stages shown below may merge into each other; the time for each stage is only approximate.
Stage 1 (30 minutes to 12 hours after ingestion):
Apparent intoxication with alcohol (but no ethanol on breath), nausea, vomiting and haematemesis, coma and convulsions (often focal). Nystagmus, ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, papilloedema, hypotonia, hyporeflexia, myoclonic jerks, tetanic contractions and cranial nerve palsies (II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XII) may occur. Metabolic acidosis develops.
Stage 2 (12-24 hours after ingestion):
Increased respiratory rate, sinus tachycardia, hypertension, pulmonary oedema and congestive cardiac failure develop.
Stage 3 (24-72 hours after ingestion):
Flank pain, renal angle tenderness, acute tubular necrosis, hypocalcaemia (as a consequence of calcium complexing with oxalate), calcium oxalate monohydrate crystalluria, hyperkalaemia and hypomagnesaemia develop.
Calcium oxalate monohydrate crystalluria is diagnostic and hypocalcaemia is frequent. Leucocytosis is a common but a non-specific finding. Severe metabolic acidosis, hyperkalaemia, convulsions and coma carry a poor prognosis.

Metabolic changes:
Patients will develop a high osmolar gap as they absorb the toxic alcohol over the first few hours. Thereafter, as it is metabolised, the osmolar gap will fall while the patient's anion gap will climb and acidosis worsens. A severely poisoned patient can present early with a normal anion gap and a normal pH or hydrogen ion concentration. However, their osmolar gap will be high.
Absence of a high anion gap metabolic acidosis does not exclude the diagnosis if the presentation is early. Acidosis only develops after some of the toxic alcohol has been metabolised.
Absence of an elevated osmolar gap does not exclude serious poisoning since the osmolar gap begins to fall once the toxic alcohol is metabolised and may therefore not be elevated in the later stages of poisoning.
A high anion gap metabolic acidosis suggests that presentation is late and that a substantial amount of the toxic alcohol has been metabolised. The high anion gap usually occurs as the serum bicarbonate falls with progressive development of metabolic acidosis.
A high anion gap metabolic acidosis can occur after ingestion of any toxic alcohol (e.g. methanol; ethylene glycol; diethylene glycol) or with other clinical conditions (e.g. diabetic or alcoholic ketoacidosis, renal failure, multi-organ failure).
Although plasma lactate may be increased, some automated arterial blood gas analysers may erroneously report an elevated lactate which is in fact due to cross reactivity with metabolic products of the toxic alcohol.

Management
Early treatment with an antidote will prevent the production of toxic metabolites, severe acidosis and renal failure. Delay in commencing treatment with an antidote will result in a more severely poisoned patient.

Sertraline

Type of Product
Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI). Used for the treatment of depressive illness, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder.

Ingredients
Sertraline
Tablets - 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg
Concentrate for oral solution - 100 mg/5 mL

Toxicity
Fatalities are uncommon when sertraline is taken alone in overdose. However, deaths have occurred when other agents are co-ingested (Filter et al, 2007; Milner et al, 1998).
On the evidence available, sertraline has a wide margin of safety in overdose. In adults, overdoses of 700 mg to 2,100 mg have not resulted in serious symptoms. Ingestion of 4,000 mg resulted in convulsions in an adolescent. The largest known ingestion is 13.5 g with recovery reported. Another overdose of 2.5 g sertraline alone resulted in death (Zoloft SPC, 2017). Overdosage of 400 mg and 500 mg in two children have resulted in serotonin syndrome (Zoloft SPC, 2017).
An 11-year retrospective case study comparing the severity of SSRI exposures in children under 6-years found that of 13,358 sertraline exposures, only 3 developed major features (life-threatening or leading to significant residual disability) and 257 developed moderate symptoms (requiring treatment but not life-threatening). Of the remaining patients 1742 developed minor symptoms (transient, rapidly resolving) and the majority (11,355) none (Klein-Schwartz et al, 2012).
An 8-year-old female developed serotonin toxicity after ingestion of 1500 mg sertraline and required admission to ICU. She was discharged without any neurological sequelae (Grenha et al, 2013).
A 22-month-old female who ingested between 250 mg and 300 mg became lethargic but made a complete recovery (Catalano et al, 1998).
Peak plasma concentrations occur about 5 to 8 hours after ingestion. The plasma elimination half-life is about 26 hours (Sertraline SPC, 2022).

If taken with other serotonergic agents there is a greater risk of serotonin toxicity (serotonin syndrome).

Features
Clinical features may include GI upset, fever, tremor, agitation, diaphoresis, dizziness, dilated pupils, drowsiness, hallucinations, convulsions (these may be delayed) and coma.
Cardiovascular features include tachycardia, hypotension, hypertension, QT and QRS prolongation and Torsade de Pointes.
Rhabdomyolysis may occur late in the presentation and in the absence of convulsions. Other features include hepatotoxicity, hyponatraemia (due to SIADH) and hypoglycaemia.

Serotonin Toxicity
Serotonin toxicity may occur, especially in those exposed to multiple drugs affecting the serotonin system. Features include CNS effects (including agitation or coma), autonomic instability (including hyperpyrexia), and neuromuscular excitability (including clonus and raised CK).
Death of patients with serotonin toxicity may be due to hyperpyrexia with associated multi organ failure.",2384847,2384847,2384685,2384685,2384782,,,

Conspective article on the efficiency of drugs used for assisted dying,2593974,b_adr,"Jul 12, 2024 at 12:50 PM","This article does not necessarily provide any new information, but I really liked it, as it summarizes all of the most commonly used drugs for assisted dying. This is essentially the best that we have up with as species (within the legal restrictions). And yet, there are still many complications with these drugs, given that peaceful death is the key goal. Overall, it appears that any method with drug ingestion orally will be much less peaceful than a method where an anesthetic injection is administered at first. At least for me, this makes me want to diverge from the original SN method and try to obtain some sort of intravenous anesthetic right after ingestion of SN.
