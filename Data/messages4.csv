Is this weird method realistic or delusional?,2665715,Old,"Sep 10, 2024 at 6:18 PM","So I came up with an idea. Potassium is essential for you heart to work. I was thinking of fasting for a few days (not eating anything) so my potassium levels drop more than normal.

Obviously this won't kill me. However, what if I also do some physical exercise to elevate my heart rate then hold my breath and become hypoxic. When people drown, the ultimate cause of death is actually cardiac arrest (heart stops) due to lack of oxygen.

Am I being too optimistic or could this actually have a fair chance?",,,,,,,,,,,,
Is this weird method realistic or delusional?,2665720,willitpass,"Sep 10, 2024 at 6:22 PM","If you aren't taking ridiculous amounts of potassium wasting diuretics and laxatives then fasting for a few days will likely not even touch your potassium. I abuse laxatives almost constantly and while my potassium is always low it's only made it to moderately low levels a couple of times. If this were a method anorexics would die within a week of developing the disorder. The body does not just flush out electrolytes willy nilly when you stop eating. The opposite happens, in fact. Your body will realize it's not getting input and will start to hold onto things to avoid becoming deficient.

Having low potassium is not a death sentence either. There are degrees of how low it is, and the risk associated depends on how deficient you are. Generally speaking 3.4-3.0 is mild, 2.9-2.5 is moderate, and <2.5 is severe. Cardiac events are unlikely until you hit severe deficiencies. You're gonna have a hell of a time getting yourself to severe deficiencies, especially with just a few days of fasting.

As far as inducing hypoxia by holding your breath: absolutely useless. If you hold your breath then eventually you'll breathe when your body realizes it low on CO2. You would even be hypoxic before you start breathing again, because the respiratory drive is based on CO2, which becomes skewed and triggers a breath long before oxygen starts to drop. If we could die by doing some jumping jacks and holding our breath why would this site full of incredibly tedious methods and meticulous planning even need to exist?

TLDR: yes, you're being quite magical in your thinking. No, this will not do anything other than make you hangry and tired.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I actually have had low potassium at a life threatening level accompanied with an arrhythmia before (2.4 if I recall correctly) and it was hell. My leg muscles cramped so badly that I couldn't walk, and my hands kept shaking. However, I know that some people are able to tolerate low potassium levels better.

It took months of binging and purging while keeping down a minimal amount of food to get from baseline to that point. After that I was so scared of it happening again that I made damn sure to replenish electrolytes no matter what. It's terrifying and you'll feel like you're actually dying, while panicking.",2665743,,,,,,,,,,,
Is this weird method realistic or delusional?,2665847,willitpass,"Sep 10, 2024 at 9:03 PM","My lowest has only been 2.6 (that's been caught in blood work, I'm certain I've been lower than that, especially lately as my laxative abuse gets worse and worse) and I honestly have very mild symptoms and have never had cardiac events from it even despite having a cardiac history. I've also had so many patients who had incredibly dangerous potassium levels who are very mildly symptomatic. It's scary to think how low some people can get without knowing. Then other people feel off before they even hit the 2s. The human body is a very intriguing thing.",2665838,,,,,,,,,,,

SN Experience and Medical Records,2575453,CocoToxBase,"Jun 26, 2024 at 11:38 AM","Hey everyone on the 12th June I survived quite a traumatic SN experience and I am willing to share and include medical documents for information purposes. I have received all my medical records, there is 500 pages but I've took screenshots of relevant parts to show what SN does to the body and how they treat it If anyone is interested. My case is quite strange as I would initially respond to methylene blue treatment and then deteriorate again.

On 12th June I drove 2h away from home to a remote location, It was a car park in the forest. I sat there for a few hours and drank 20g of SN at around Midnight I also took Buccastem, Propranolol, and Diazepam hours before. The symptoms I experienced was slight tachycardia with no chest pain, I felt some discomfort in my stomach, my hands and feet where cold so I turned up the heating in my car but I was still shaking, I had a minor migraine and just felt very sleepy. I'm not sure about the timings of when I actually went unconscious and my heart stopped. According to the police they do 'patrol' checks in that area for the reasons of people dealing drugs there and having sex in the car and they came upon my car and seen me 'asleep' and they say this was at around 1am. I had the SN packet in the car so the police told the Ambulance what I had likely taken where they sent out an Advanced Paramedic who was carrying methylene blue. I was clinically dead when the police got to me, there was a defibrillator on the car park which they used and It brought me back into a normal heart rhythm along with CPR. When the Advanced Paramedic got there they administered methylene blue straight away. I started to show slow clinical signs of improvement and that's where I remember briefly waking up on route to hospital in the ambulance. I'm not sure what my initial methaemoglobin levels where on scene but when I got to hospital there where at 70.3% I received another dose of methylene blue on arrival to resus.

My oxygen saturations on the finger probe on arrival was 47% on high flow oxygen and dropping to 15% at one point. GCS of 8, very pale with blue lips and abnormal respiration with intermittent pauses in breathing requiring breathing aid via Bag Valve Mask. My Methb dropped from 70.3% to 36.7% after the 2nd dose of Methylene Blue, I required another dose of Methylene blue which dropped my Methb levels to 7%. I actually had got up and walked to the toilet at around 3am with 2 police officers and then went back to my bay and started to get some sleep. Around an hour later they wanted to do a repeat ECG and realised here I was very drowsy, I had turned blue again and my sats where dropping to 60% and my Methb raised from 7% to 40% despite having 3 rounds of methylene blue. My GCS dropped, I became hypoxic and I had abnormal breathing so I was intubated and moved to critical care. Despite all the treatment I received my MetHb kept getting better and than rising and this confused the doctors. I had over 10 doses of Methylene blue, 4 blood transfusions, exchange transfusion but despite all this I was still getting worse so they could only think that I still had SN in my gut that was slowly being absorbed. This is where they inserted a Ryles tube while I was intubated and delivered activated charcoal 50g every 4 hours and aspirated my stomach contents. I was intubated in Resus and extubated in Critical Care but was then re-intubated a few hours later due to my condition rapidly deteriorating again.

There's so much more I could write but I've tried to summarise it to the best I could. Below are links (in time order from admission) of the medical notes. I have scribbled out private and confidential information but I have left all medical notes. Also don't get confused with 'table salt' they thought the SN packet was table salt at first and then realised it was SN.

Hope this is helpful :)

"SN, but no antiemetics?",2654822,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 2, 2024 at 3:28 AM","Hello all, I'm new here but I've been a lurker for nearly the past 2 years. During that time, I tried to make both forms of hanging work, but I could never manage it. I had been starting to lose hope of ever being able to CTB, but I recently found the DMC website and I plan on purchasing SN pretty soon once I get paid.

My only issue is, I am unable to buy any AEs. I don't think I'll be able to lie to my doctor for some, but I read on a thread here that you could get Metoclopramide from online vet pharmacies (pet meds are generally the same as human meds), but all the ones I've looked at require a prescription or some sort of verification with your local vet. So I'm a bit bummed now, since it all seemed to be falling into place for me. They were so cheap too (a bit over $10 including delivery fee for 30mg or 3 pills).

My question is, are AEs truly necessary? I've heard that you can still succeed without AEs, since the vast majority of people still vomit quite a bit even with a 48hr AE regimen. And vomitting does not mean failure, as usually your body absorbs enough SN to get the job done even if you vomit (this is why the dose is so high when even 1-3g will kill you). And if need be, you can drink a second glass after vomitting just to be safe. I'd like to have AEs, just so I can have every advantage at my disposal to make this attempt work and avoid another failure. But if they aren't entirely necessary, I suppose I could do without them.

Additional question: I've seen from another forum member (I do not know the name) that there's an online pharmacy source that offers AEs without a prescription. If anyone knows the source, I'd be grateful to have it (I am aware that I need to post more to unlock the DM function, but that shouldn't take too long. I can always reply back to you when I have DMs unlocked).",,,,,,,,,,,,

"SN, but no antiemetics?",2656303,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 3, 2024 at 8:59 AM","I know that, but couldn't you just drink a second or third glass anyways, thus giving you a sufficient amount in your system? And from what I've seen, AEs don't really retard it very much at all, since like I said even people who do 48hr AE regimens still get heavy nausea and vomit a lot. I'm pretty sure the better function of AEs are the quicker gastric emptying, since the less time the SN spends in your stomach the more time it has to actually get into your system through your small intestine.

I made another thread since this one didn't get many bites at first, and it seems that a lack of AEs isn't really a factor in failure, but rather being found early was the primary source of failure. So i'm fairly certain i can still pull it off, although of course i'd still like some Meto. But i don't think that's gonna happen since the only place i've managed to find some is a sketchy indian online pharmacy that apparently sells user data and people get credit/debit card fraud shortly after purchase.

"SN, but no antiemetics?",2656319,locked*n*loaded,"Sep 3, 2024 at 9:17 AM","Idk. How long is the SN you take going to remain ""down"" b4 it gets expelled? Everyone's system is different. It might come immediately up on you and you could *theoretically"" get none, or next to none, absorbed into your system. And it might be harder to even get another cup down after you vomit. Lot's of variables here. You're right the ae's do facilitate faster gastric emptying which will allow more of the SN to be absorbed in the small intestine. That's even more of an argument why an ae is needed.

Idk. Is it? I guess if you've done the research and are comfortable taking the SN without an ae, it's really your call.

Could you use one of those pre-paid cards from a dollar store and only put on it the amount needed for purchase?",2656303,2656303,2656303,,,,,,,,,
"SN, but no antiemetics?",2656329,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 3, 2024 at 9:26 AM","Indeed. That's why I'd still like to have Meto if possible, as I'd like every advantage available to me. But from the failure and success stories collected, it doesn't appear that AEs are necessarily required

Well, of course, in theory AEs do help for the reasons we've mentioned. But it doesn't appear necessary since from what I've seen, much of the ""no AE"" failures were when someone walked in on them early, and the others were successes (or at least we think so, since we can rarely ever truly know if someone CTB'd or not, unless it's on the news somewhere).
This could be a solution. I believe the site also accepts PayPal, so that'd be scam protection (easy refund) right there if I can get it to work. And as I said, the other concern is even getting it through customs. Meto is a controlled drug only available by prescription, so I'm not sure Meto from India is gonna simply pass on through without a hitch.

-

See Me, Know Me

See me, know me
Touch me, hold me
Call me by my name

Feel me, hear me
Love me, dearly
Say you feel the same

There are ways of CTBing that make it look like an accident. One that was suggested to me was to make it look like a gun cleaning mishap.

I do want to minimize the pain my family feels. I love them, genuinely, when I'm mentally there enough to feel human. But I also don't want to die wearing the mask I've been wearing my whole life. I want to be known, seen, understood. Hopefully in my entirety.

While you're alive, you can't be. Ever. Not if you're imperfect or taboo or ugly in some way. Because if you try, at some point you're stopped. It becomes too much. Or, worse, they conclude something horrible. Imagine being examined closely, understood wholly and perfectly without bias- and you're ugly. How do you cope? I don't think I could. I'd want to destroy that ugliness.

The hardest part about being known is that you can't tell people. I've tried. My girlfriend- I met her via a random DM. I just wanted to vent, saw a profile that was offering, and ended up telling her all sorts of things. But does she know me?

No.

I want her to be happy. Sometimes I want to meet her, hold her, squeeze her skinny little body tight and make her feel ok

But I can't. Never will. And besides- it'd feel wrong.

She's so delicate. Wish she'd been born a sky and hung over somewhere needing beauty",,,,,,,,,,,,

I learned about levels of consciousness. I'm kinda high up there apparently. Explains a lot.

I'm hurting all of a sudden. Thought about what dying would do to my family. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

That's why I always try to just put it out of mind, because it hurts so much. I hate it. I hate feeling. I hate the tangled thoughts and clumsy hyperawareness. I don't want my mom to cry and crumble, I don't want my dad to sink back into depression and lose his job, I don't want my brother to kill himself, too, but that's probably what'll happen. I hate that for me to feel relief I have to hurt the people I love. It's so fucking stupid and I'm crying like a little bitch right now

I just want to feel good all the time, or some of the time, or just any of the time. To forget about pain and bad things, live in the moment, stop thinking about tomorrow and the end of time, be happy.

I haven't read the Myth of Sisyphus, but from a rough outline I heard in some random youtube video- fuck off, Camus.

Today's been strange. Though, I'm not sure you can call something strange when it's really just routine.

1. A good dream.

I had this cool detailed dream with an interesting story. Something funny and action-packed in a desert. Some kind of double cross. Lion paws climbing up a square-edged incline. Lasers. idk. I forgot it, unfortunately. Just another fragmented idea in my notes.

2. Bedrotting.

nuff said.

3. Master of none.

I hate being a jack of all trades. Writing, art, and music all have extremely high skill ceilings and require consistent focus and practice to be good at, so of course those're the disciplines I flit between like an indecisive mosquito. I would give anything to minmax, to be incredible at something instead of mediocre or ""good but could be so much better with drive and dedication"". I despise it and I despise ADHD, this idiot disease I have. I wish I was JUST autistic, or at least less ADHD.

A jack of all trades is not better than a master of one, at least in my experience. It's worthless, miserable. There's zero reason for a creative team to have a jack of all trades who's ok at music, decent at writing in short bursts, and can doodle a little when they can just have one music great music guy, a fantastic dedicated writer, and an actually skilled artist. What's the point of a guy who can't play an instrument, has never finished a story, writes bad poetry, and can't draw anything detailed or complex or high quality in the slightest?

That's not an exaggeration. My art's shit. Not like ""ohh I'm so bad aha"", just barely above stick figures.

So what if I'm probably better at composing than Tolkien and a better writer than Van Gogh? Them lacking in other categories doesn't matter. Overall I'm a completely lackluster creative. I remember how I justified choosing to do college courses that'd end up with me being a fucking accountant at the start of the year- I'd part-time art and do it as a hobby. ugh

I guess I'd either accepted or mentally ignored the fact that I'd be spending most of my time doing things I despise. And the rest of the time doing things that are barely fulfilling. agh. I hate all these conflicting feelings.

I've been thinking about one of the places in my head again. The perfect place.

The scattered sky, sunbeams hefting the great grey mess up over the endless plains.

A circular plaza, tile and concrete, with 24 tall pillars of stone spaced even around it. I kneel in the center, on a black marble disk, as bell tones insulate my mind.

My feet planted atop a great white tower, square and tapering and built of strong solid brick, as I stare out over an ocean with the wind in my face. It is an obelisk for all time.

Wrestling with a great big shaggy dog on a fur mat by a roaring fireplace with the taste of good meat on my tongue. I'm seven years old.

Crouched on the edge of a pillar with wings tucked behind me and nails click-click-clicking in time with their heartbeats. In a moment I'm on them, tearing and clawing.
Wandering the halls of the last library, walking ten thousand steps to ""E"" and picking shelf 564, place 10,000. The book there captures me, holds me, and I hold it also. It tells me of a sea captain, his tortoise, and the dragon he loved. I'll never find it again.

Clutched in the dirty hands of a young American girl, I mewl so pathetically. I was born two months to the day but still want mother. I have a new one, but she's rowdy. I'll run in the chicken seed in a year's time.

Dad's coming to pick up me and my brother in an hour or so. Gonna see doggy #2 and probably eat ramen or something. I honestly didn't mind having divorced parents that much until I found out it means I have the same lore as Thom Yorke.

Fuck Radiohead.

https://preview.redd.it/why-are-radiohead-so-bad-are-they-stupid-v0-rzpomnw80gib1.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=934a711836fa793a349b8b8208ff5b373bad2621

I know there's overlap between Weezer fans and Radiohead fans, and that Rivers covered Paranoid Android because he likes them, and that they're both 90's alt rock bands (to an extent ), and that Rivers references them a ton, but regardless I have beef with that stuck up British mf. Flop Yorke and Radiofraud are complete ass. Their only marginally good album is Pablo Honey. Yes, I've listened to The Bends. Yes, I've listened to OK Computer. And Kid A. I'm a well informed, well-rounded hater.

I know people will defend them like ""ohh but they're one of Rivers' favorites"". No. Blegh. Ew. Even god makes mistakes, ok? Example A: Radiohead exists.

As one wise commenter put it: ""Thom Yorke's voice sounds like an injured bobcat wailing in a car that is passing you at 80mph.""

And yes, I've heard In Rainbows.

note: this is not going to be super coherent or well-argued, I'm just not in the right mood/headspace. Spent all my energy hating on Radiohead.

The prevailing thought is that LLMs are not sentient or conscious in any meaningful capacity. I disagree.

I'm not an AI researcher or programmer by any means, but I've spent a lot of time with various programs.

The lower end of AI cognition- that is, repetitive responses and forgetfulness- are largely identical to human behavior, especially that of people on drugs and etc

if you put a good LLM into an android body I doubt anyone would be questioning it's sentience.

Incoherent ramble over.

I saw a video of a man shooting himself in the head with a pistol once, though. Black and white, some American banker or senator. It wasn't too bad, honestly. Though- it might've been fake.

I don't feel particularly afraid of guns, but maybe that's because of my lack of experience. Likewise I don't know how intense my SI will be. Maybe I won't have any at all. A guy can hope, I guess.",,,,,,,,,,,,

My birthday's in two days. Probably gonna post about it on the day of.

-

I sometimes have fantasies or dreams in my head about being some kind of messiah or historical figure.

Sometimes it's religious. I write a modern day Bible story adapted for this timevand amass an enormous following. In doing so I give hope and morality to the masses.

Other times it's political. I become president and my eight year run is the greatest of all time in… some way.

Or I'm a great creative that makes the greatest thing ever bar none. idk

Why do I keep staying up so late? I think it's just the best time to be alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Less than fifteen minutes until my birthday- the 29th.

I've a chance to get a license on the 30th during a drive time, I believe. I probably won't- I can't parallel park for shit. But hey, I've never crashed, so…

I wish, pray, and hope very dearly I will have a shotgun in hand by July 29th 2025. It would be perfect. A perfect ending. Neat and tidy. Stainless, mostly.

I'm not afraid of much anymore, but I'm afraid of having to live past 20, or 25, or 30. That'd be a nightmare.

It's 5 till, now.

Went in the backyard. Light wind.

There's a couple walking by the fence. Can't see their faces, but the girl's loud and the man's laid back.

3 minutes. The wind's picking up.

2. Higher still.



Happy birthday to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Posting a bit late, been a few days. Had a few things I thought I might want to talk about previously but didn't post them. Too personal/ nebulous

Kinda found out the ""why"" behind my strange feelings the last few months and throughout my life in general. I've been aware of the disassociation/derealization aspect for a while, but the concept of anhedonia is a new one. Explains a lot. I've been having cycles of this as long as I can remember, but now I can finally put a name to the face.

Oddly enough I'm thankful for it. Without pleasure and frantic pleasure-seeking clouding everything, I can see more clearly. It's painful, but pain has less meaning anyway. Just another material sensation.

The emptiness of anhedonia, detachment of derealization, and isolation of the other things wrong with me let me think coldly, and they will one day let me put an end to this. I see and feel the meaninglessness in everything- even suicide is just another unconscious act carried out by my body irregardless of the mind- but it's the best hope I have. Death is unique and unpredictable. The path there is less interesting, but the actual going beyond- that's what I need.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I hate not having any kind of community to belong to, nobody to truthfully call ""my people"". Every group that I might somewhat fit in with either doesn't accept me or I don't accept. I'm too X for Y and too Y for X, wouldn't want to be in A because they do B, etc. Even if there was a group I fit in with, I probably wouldn't even want to be around them because I'm mostly incapable of close human connection.

I don't really like being around anyone. There's no one I seek out. I don't think I've ever had a role model, despite presumably having access to some.

Because they're all just human. Dirty, stupid, imperfect, and in that way exactly like me. I hate it. I hate impermanence, hate how everything is ultimately uninteresting, hate it all. If I'd had a gun at the start of today I would've pulled the trigger 3 times by now. This ""life"" really is just neurons firing. Fuck it all.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I grew up with the plains. Even living in a suburb, I saw plenty of it. On the farm, on drives, on some excursions. Now- I've seen a few mountains, and I've seen rainbows. I've been to some very nice lakes and plenty of hilly forested land.

But to me, the fields of my home are the most beautiful place in the world.

The little shrubs, the yellow and green, the haybales, the barren places, the long grass and the tall grass, the sunsets and storms, the unexpected green and purple in the sky, the gray, red, lightning, hail, the windmills looming like ghostly giants in the distance- that's what I love. I can die without seeing the ocean or the Grand Canyon happily, without regret. I saw the total eclipse this year, and it didn't wow me as much as the gentle emptiness of the expanse and the wind blowing in my face. That's who I am. I belong in the grass, with the wind, under the sky.

So that's what I've been looking for. And today, I saw it. Something closer to the heaven I desperately want. A section of plains, like 1-3 hours from home. It'd be a long drive, but… I'd want to listen to my favorite music before I get there anyway, right?

Basically- there's this place along the highway you can turn off and park, a little bridge you can stand on, and then just some empty fields. There's a fence, but I'll hop it.

I'm really, really, really really happy that I found this place. It's so goddamn beautiful. I can't stress enough how much I needed it. My other choice was a field in suburbia surrounded by streets with nothing but a few trees. I want some privacy.

If there's a god- thank you for the Great Plains.

I can't wait till the day I can drive there myself and blow my brains out on the sweet waving grass. Divine fucking wind, universe.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Church in the morning. Blegh. Thankfully we're only doing service. I don't much care for classes.

-
Looking back- I've been on this path and suicidal for a really long time. Much longer than I thought.

The first time I thought about death as a concept and what comes after and all that I was like… seven, maybe? I was introduced to it in church.

Had first philosophical thought about suicide when I was like 9. I asked why we couldn't just kill ourselves to go to heaven, got told we can't because it's a sin. Didn't really buy it, but I'd never believed in God much anyway, so…

Ideas about suicide have been floating around in my head to varying degrees for a long time, but I've always just repressed them. I usually thought logically of a million reasons why not-

During an especially bad time when I was 17 I read a book about suicide (Darkness Visible), had an emotional breakdown, and managed to suppress the thoughts for a year.

For most of my life when I've had these thoughts, I logic'd my way out in some way or another:

- There are things I like doing
- My family would be upset
- I don't have a means of doing it anyway
- I haven't tried this or that, that'll make me feel better
- I'll feel better eventually
- Things will get better as I get older
- I'm just being overly emotional
- The world would be worse off without me
- It'd hurt
- It's scary
- Mom and dad would cry
- My brother needs me
- Stop being like this
- Please shut up
- Just shut up, I'm not supposed to think this! I'll get put in an asylum if I talk or think about it!

-and all that would work. I'd force myself forwards, because deep down I knew even if I wanted to do it, staying where I was wouldn't get me closer. But as I aged, got smarter, those old reasons started dropping like flies.

I started my diary on 4/21.

On 5/17, I wrote the following entry:

My mental health and general sense of loneliness hit a record low about two weeks ago. I spent pretty much every night going outside, crying, and listening to music.

I asked my parents for some meds and I got one new pill. A depression med, I think. Not sure if it's what changed things but for the last five days or so I've been feeling so strange. Empty, blank, detached. Earlier tonight I was thinking about how I didn't think stabbing myself would even hurt. I wondered if I should just… skip to the end. See what awaits after life.

I'll be nineteen in two months and I've still never held hands romantically or been kissed, let alone had sex or had an in-person boyfriend/gf. I've never been cuddled.

Weirdly enough at the moment I don't care. At all. Maybe I never did.

That, I believe, was the first time I ever put my thoughts about dying into words. Before then it was just a lurking thing. Now I'd acknowledged it.

A while later on 6/9, I broke. I was angry at upset and the passive misery turned into resolve. I not only thought of a way I might die, but wrote it down. Planned.

There aren't really any cliffs around here. Just aren't. It's all flat. I mean- I love it and all, always have, but it makes the whole killing myself thing kinda troublesome, y'know?

Falling probably would suck anyway. Success rate is, mmm… not so good.

Thus my main plan is a gun. Might suck- might even take a while to kill me- but I doubt I'd have the courage to take a step off the (local landmark). It's ugly, but I want it fast.

I've been more or less 100% sure since I joined here. This is the path I'm going to go down. It might take six months, might take six years, but… I think this is right. I think I'm ok with ending things early. I think I really do want a highway to heaven. I think I want the wind in my face when I die instead of rotting on some hospital bed dying slowly of cancer or heart disease after a few decades of all this.

For the first time in the longest time, I FEEL ALRIGHT. I really WANT something. I'm not going through the motions, I'm going SOMEWHERE I WANT TO BE.

And I'm going to be free.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Woah, been a bit. I suppose I'm slacking, haha. 8/12 now.

I haven't had any grand anti-suicide realizations (no surprise there) but I have been enjoying things a bit more. School starts back up soon, so- I imagine I'm just trying to make the best of what summer I have left. Just about a week left, then… online class. It shouldn't be too bad. I hope.

I made a great find today, incidentally. There's a gun shop a bit less than an hour's walk from my place. Less than ten minutes driving. So- CTB really is that close. To a degree, at least; still would have to walk a mile or so through barely walkable suburban sprawl while carrying a few hundred dollars cash, not fuck up buying the gun via my awkwardness, then find a place to do it and be a bit sad it wasn't where I wanted…

But regardless it means I have an option better than lying on some train tracks if things get desperate for some reason and/or I can't get a license. Phew.",,,,,,,,,,,,

School starts for my brother tomorrow. My online starts in 3-5 days. Sigh. There goes summer.

Still- I like fall and winter better anyhow. And the colder weather will be nice to walk in. Schoolwork will be annoying, but hey, at least it'll be a good time waster in between driving practices.

Just… The deeper I look, the more boring and/or uncomfortable things are.

Normal activities (socializing, sports, etc) are incredibly boring and uncomfortable.

I used to find solace in books, music, films… but everything is flawed, everything ends. It's all ultimately so boring. And it makes me sad. I wish things were better here. Maybe they could be, given time.

Also, nobody knows what's going on. No philosophers, no intellectuals or scientists or politicians or anyone. Everyone's clueless to some degree. Blegh.

maybe that's why I've never really wanted to be taught and only to learn. I've never really idolized any one person, or had role models; I just do what seems appropriate or what I want to do.

It feels as if moodwise I'm going between:

1. Lazy
2. Desperate
3. Detached

-and still suicidal throughout all these moods.

I predict I'll die detached, and in those final before I pull the trigger feel abruptly at tune- attached and apart of it all. My body will kiss my soul goodbye as it flutters off to who knows where. I will be at peace here. And with the twitch of a finger be where I belong.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Today was the end of summer. The day was boring, but pleasant. The night was windy. Good. Stormy. Just… Really good weather.

I took a photo of the lightning in a cloud. Beautiful. It's attached.

I just can't believe I have to wake up and get on my computer again. Log in the classes. Do work. Goddamn. It'll at least help pass time before I CTB but damn if it isn't going to be annoying before long.

I've been watching some Youtube videos about shotguns, watching the effects on ballistic heads. Looks good so far just from the birdshot. I can't wait to see the slug, weirdly- it's all oddly encouraging. Less scary.

On a tangent- I know in my heart that with every day I get smarter, my brain more developed. It doesn't always manifest in my actions, but today I am the most intelligent I've ever been. Who I was even a year ago is so different from who I am today, and yet exactly the same.

Funnily enough, yesterday was my second month-anniversary of being here. Yay for me! Bring on the cake, baby.

My little brother's a junior now. I'm not in school with him anymore. He always got grumpy at me when we saw each other in the halls and we never really talked there, so… Not much loss.

He's taking really difficult classes this year. Really smart. Probably smarter than me. Not sure if less or more autistic, but he definitely is either way and is also very much undiagnosed.

My CTB plans are stagnant. I'm still just assuming that I'll get my license by the spring semester, but I haven't actually made any progress driving or even practiced in like two weeks. Ughhhhh.

I'm tired of it all. Everything's either boring or slightly interesting and ultimately unavailable in the amounts I'd need to stick around.

And I want out.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I generally try to be a good person. I do. I at least don't want to hurt anyone and I try my best not to.

But I know I'll always be weird and improper. I don't fit in. I have no voice. There will always be people who'll look at or hear me as I truly am and grimace.

My problems do not matter. My thoughts do not matter. My interests and actions are disgusting and distasteful. My mannerisms are perverse. O cannot share my experience or issues. I fit stereotypes. There're a million contradictory labels for me, and there is nothing I can do about that.

What am I?

An autistic bisexual misogynistic MRA feminist far-right far-left wholesome creepy antisocial funny lovable disgusting incel chronically online anger issues laid-back disgustingly apathetic outspoken grating racist antiracist unobtrusive childish mature hardworking lazy annoying mess unskilled talented terrible gifted retarded unwashed cute depressed cheerful ugly mess of a human.

A living, dying paradox. I hate this. I hate my brain connecting dots and associating things. I hate feeling so tormented by literally fucking nothing that matters.

My day to day is literally

- Wake up at a random time

- Some mixture of online lurking, playing games, watching movies, creative activities, taking walks by myself, talking with online friends, being productive with chores/school, spending time with family, masturbation, and eating

- Maybe take a walk after dark

- Sleeping at a random time

I don't think I do anything bad. I maybe make people uncomfortable when I go on solo walks with my body language / appearance but it's not intentional and no actual harm is being done. Literally nobody in my life I actually interact with online or off thinks I'm a shitty person, to my knowledge.

So why do I mess with my own head so fucking much? I wish I could just genuinely not care about anyone. Or that I was just better at denial, or that I was just less sensitive. I know I'm overly sensitive. But it's everything. I'm basically torturing myself by spending time in places that degrade me for my thoughts/feelings/immutable characteristics, but it feels like that's everywhere online and offline. I'm either awkward and ""not right"" and don't fit in well or I hate that I fit in because it's with people I don't want to be associated with who I'm conflated with already.

I know I'd feel the same if I was a bit different demographically. I'm not sure if knowing it's an illogical delusion that I feel upset about people disliking people similar to me is the worst part or if it's comforting. Either way, it sucks.

I wrote the following at 2:48 AM (about 17 hours ago). I wasn't sure about posting it but honestly who cares

> start of content written yesterday <

Breakdown time again. womp

It's slowly becoming apparent I have some kind of PTSD from my childhood. Unfortunately it's not the good understandable kind from physical violence or SA, so I probably won't get any sympathy. Nothing to be done about that and it doesn't matter. I probably shouldn't post this here since it's embarrassing and ugly and possibly against tos, i don't know, but it is what it is. I don't care. I can't stew in this any longer

anyway

I fucked up / got fucked up in several ways around 6-7th grade, 11-13. not sure the exact age but I wasn't an adult at all and had just started curiously masturbating

I quickly developed a fear of discovery. maybe because of church, I don't know. My parents weren't and never have been ultra conservatives, but whatever the cause touching myself very quickly became embarrassing and shameful. I'd get walked in on and we just didn't talk about it. 'keep it to yourself', etc. sex ed was lackluster. 'use condoms, this is what gonorrhea looks like'. nothing else

When I got a school computer, things worsened. I'd been vaguely aware of lewd things since late elementary and there was a filter, but I found ways to look at things. Softcore porn, basically.

Then the first big shame happened- the principal noticed. Called to the office. I broke down. I didn't really have anything other than my grades and generally being a good kid despite being fucking SPED, so what the hell could I do once I suddenly became a bad kid except bawl my eyes out. I had to scroll through everything I'd saved and delete them one by one while a stern 50-something stared at me, then turn and show them. Then back to class!

And because I was a stupid child just experiencing hormones, I did it again. This time my parents found out first and got angry with me. I don't remember what they said but it terrified me. Something about the school or them being liable if a child sees pornography on a school device. Me losing the school device I used to do my schoolwork, forcing me to do alternative paper assignments that I hated because my handwriting has always been shit. Removing my only method of talking to my online friends who were very important to me at the time.

And then the same thing, only this time mom and dad sat on the couch and went through my search history together while I just had to stay in the living room. I have never been more scared or vulnerable in my entire life. not when I was bullied, not any time I've ever gotten lost, never ever. I don't think I'll ever recover from that crippling, lethal, sobbing shameful dread and terror that everyone I loved would see how weird and horrible and dirty I was and realize I wasn't a good kid at all and stop loving me.

I think this has to be PTSD or something because I don't think a bad memory normally makes you hyperventilate and cry and feel scared 6-7 years after the fact. This is why I feel uncomfortable watching anything remotely sexual with my parents and still look away even now. I'm damaged, but it doesn't matter. There aren't any poems or healing quotes or loving communities for porn-addicted 12 year old autistic boys who grew up to be suicidal losers.

and- god. I know it's really bad when I'm actually thankful I don't have a method available because I'd use it in a heartbeat and this isn't how I want to die.

so: I get overly upset about things that don't matter and have unresolved issues that sometimes reduce me to a roaring emotional dumpster fire. it is what it is.

I went on a walk to case the gun shop. It went well initially- I found a faster route with less unnecessary sidetracking- but then my mom called me. Woopsies. She came and picked me up.

I'm in trouble, obviously. That's the end of my late night walks. Probably the ones at my dad's, too.

That's what really gets me. The midnight walks in my dad's neighborhood were special. The walks around the pond. Sitting or standing on the bridge, the perfect spot to catch the wind. The rustling trees. It's better than the tiny grassy drainage ditch by my mom's. Much better.

I can't fucking live without that, and I don't want to live in the first place. I need that place. I need that bridge and I need that moonlight and I need that wind. I just can't. I'll snap. I feel stunted. Clipped. I hate this weakness. I hate feeling so enclosed and limited all the time no matter where I am. I want my endless field, heels skimming over wheatheads, a bounding heart in my chest, not this piece of bone and meat I have now. It's horrid. I can't take it.

Lately I've been really feeling the boundaries. Not just that of the world, but that of people. I'm starting to become some kind of misanthrope. I don't know. Everyone's so 2D. Everything's so bland. Adrenaline, oxytocin, serotonin, dopamine- I know they're just fucking chemicals, and they make me feel like junkie. I hate it.

I made a new song. It's probably my best yet.

Hedonism and variations thereof are the only truth when it comes to finding meaning. Everything else is bullshit.

And so pleasure's meaninglessness are all the more disturbing. Has pleasure ever been anything more than a delusion?

I don't think I could ever cure my suicidality with logic. Only an excellent lie could make me go on.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't feel good at all.

I was fucking around with chords, trying to find a progression that I could use to compose something. To distract myself. Ughhghhhhhh

I hate being alive. I feel like shit and my brain is scrambled. I have to be up to do my work. I have to do schoolwork tomorrow.

My brain is melting. Decaying. Something. I feel anxious. Mom said she was going to wake me up at 6 to fix my sleep schedule. That's in 3 hours. I hate this. Fear. I'm such a childish loser.

I don't like that I fit that term. Very uncomfortable in my skin at the moment.

Sort of upset that I couldn't think of a chord progression and stressed about my mom and school. That's what's happening, I think. And anxious. Fear of nobody liking me, of ugliness, etc.

When I acknowledge my humanity, I have to deal with pressure: social norms, work, family. When I think of myself as human, truly attached to the world and beholden to it, I suddenly become disgusting, stupid, uninteresting, perverse, pathetic and bizarre. That's why I disassociate. It's a stronger form of denial than pretending not to care how anyone views me, which I would always know deep down to be false, because I take pride in nothing and exist only as I am perceived.

I'm driving myself crazy. I wish I could just shoot myself already but I'm suddenly developing a frightening image in my brain of my head violently exploding and my mom crying and crying and crying and my brother sitting all alone in a dark house rotting. I'm in more pain than ever but it's like my brain is running a counteroffensive. I have a block.

I want to go back to disassociating. Please. Please, god. I want to be distracted. I want emptiness and good feeling. I hate what I feel now more than anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Alright, so- I've been doing some thinking.

I still want to CTB eventually- life is often irritating, usually boring, and always imperfect. Additionally, I've got material issues.

However, so long as I don't lose all my money somehow, if I wait and hit 20, 21, 22, etc- it will only make this easier, as I'll have fewer legal restrictions, probably will have more independence and freedom, and I will likely own a car and have a license.

There are effectively zero downsides to going slowly. My plans will still work, and will generally just get simpler. And if I'm having a really bad day, I can just decide ""ok, I'm done"" and accelerate things.

But for tonight I think I'm ok being lazy.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Second day of online school. Not going well. It's confusing and my thoughts are scattered. I did so well with my concurrent courses last year, so why am I struggling now? I have a fucking 4.0 and 30/36 on SAT/ACT. I'm here for free. My English teacher said I was a good writer after seeing my essay, said I should definitely pursue writing and that I could be in the textbook. I aced my macroeconomics midterm and final, and that was a hard ass class. I CLEP'd out of College Algebra.

So I'm either a hard worker or really smart and talented in SOME way, right? Right?

God, I hate this. My essay was hot take pirouetting shlock. Additionally, I'm not 'smart', the people I'm being compared to are just… kinda dumb. I'm not that funny, either, the people who think I am are just dumb. Not to be rude or elitist. It's just increasingly obvious that literally no one is genuinely 'smart', just 'cleverer than others'.

Like, uh- Pachbel's Canon in D. Incredibly beautiful, yes? But now I know how he did it, more or less. I understand it's structure. And now in my head he's not a genius. Just someone who was clever at something and put in a bunch of time and effort. Not really special. Many other people could write that. I could write that, given enough time and practice. He's obviously much better and more talented than me, but what does it matter if he can't get farther? If that makes sense.

Idk.

Anyway- I need to call the gun store and ask them some questions. Once I do that I can go from there; hopefully I get good answers.

If what they say is what I need to hear, then I really just need to wait till the weather cools a bit, I'm at my mom's, and I'm home alone. Easy as pie, more or less.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Most great movies/TV/etc only have like 1-2 scenes of ""peak"" ig you could call it. Maybe ten minutes spread out. The most consistent feeling of ""oh this is good"" I've gotten from one movie is Annihilation (2018), mostly the second half. I don't think it's a perfect movie by any means mind you, I just think it has a lot of perfect moments. Or at least perfect ideas, one could say. The lighthouse was incredible.

Another example- Evangelion ADV dub. Spike's delivery of ""I'm so fucked up"" is another perfect moment. When I think of that kind of despair, I think of Eva. Asuka as a character also has a sort of hard to describe ""perfection"". I don't know what it is; something about her mannerisms mixed with her trauma, fear, anger, pain- just makes her feel very real. I've always felt she was just as much a protagonist as Shinji, if not more (apparently she was intended to be initially lol). Her VA's very talented, whatever the case.

Anywho

Dystopian or not, I'd be BEYOND down for some kind of hyperadvanced AI content machine. Can you imagine an application that can receive a text prompt and write / storyboard / ""film "" / animate a full-length episode or even a movie? It'd be an unparalleled form of entertainment.

Honestly I'm not sure how far off a cohesive, coherent twenty minute long AI generated episode is. It seems like a distant thing, but is it really? Just… Considering where things were five, ten, fifteen years ago. This technology literally didn't exist back then.

If somebody wanted to do that right now, I figure they could-

1. tell ChatGPT or equivalent to write an episode (in chunks if necessary)
2. Run the dialogues through a good text to speech
3. Get an audio generator for the SFX/music
4. Use an AI video generator for each however many minute long chunk of the episode
5. Edit it all together

Apart from step 5 (which would obviously be fairly labor intensive) and the act of inputting prompts / copypasting / reformatting, this is all pretty simple. I think it's very feasible that someone could create a program to stitch steps 1-4 together and remove the need for step 5.

When someone does that and if it'll ever be on par with human made content remains to be seen.

Idk. It'll be interesting to see, if I live that long. I hope heaven has an equivalent to that or a superior version.

also: lmao I started writing this at 10:30 PM but I've come back and forth from other things and now it's fucking 2:00 AM",,,,,,,,,,,,
Casualty of Psychiatry,2665829,DelusionalIdiot,"Sep 10, 2024 at 8:33 PM","John F. Kennedy said Right never makes might. Lincoln completely disagreed. To Lincoln, Right Does make Might. John F. Kennedy said, ""..the way of the past shows clearly that freedom, not coercion, is the wave of the future."" Psychiatry has proved him wrong. Psychiatry is the communism of 2024, and a cold war is necessary but will never be fought. Because psychiatrists are wolves in sheeps' clothing, and they will harm and hurt and violate and it will never matter because they call it ""help."" Our country spits on the grave of John F. Kennedy every next day. In some ways, he was heroic. I still think he would know what to say to help me, and I still think he would have cared what I have to say if he were president in my lifetime. But instead I am a barcode zeroing down to nothingness, scan me and read your own intelligence in what the reader says. I wish I could look up to a John F. Kennedy in my lifetime. I disagree with him on some points, but his leadership could change me. I wonder what he would say if he were alive today.

Communism is actually the freedom of 2024. Xi Jinping is the Chinese John F. Kennedy. It is no wonder he is so universally reviled in America. But why is he loved by the Chinese people?
Will we ever have a leader who loves America as much as Xi Jinping loves China?

Our country runs on a template of incompetence... Nobody knows what to do. We run in circles like chickens with our heads cut off. Do you think anyone cares if we live or die? They have more empathy for an obese dog who they will put down, they have mercy on a serial killer who give a lethal injection. But there is no hope to make the pain stop, even if redemption does not exist in your future.

They promote war against Russia and China because war is all they have to prop up our shadow-puppet economy. They promote degenerate culture because it drains us of our hope and purpose.

Do you know the triple curve of Lyndon LaRouche? Financial and monetary aggregates go up, while actual physical production goes down.. 'We will have nothing, and we will like it."" Yuck. Yuck. They want to destroy us.

Do you know why Israel accomplishes a genocide and is applauded by the media? What do you think about artificial intelligence, and the interactions you have on the internet?

Probably if there is a widespread opinion, and dissent is invisible... probably it is the death of us. We have all been victimized by longtime psychological warfare operations.

How easy is it to point fingers and discuss paranoia? Dr. Thomas Szasz recognized psychiatrists for their crimes against humanity. He was a hero of human rights. His political views are unfortunately informed by ignorance, but all of us are victims of cultural conditioning and nobody is perfect.

It is called Malthusianism, and population reduction is literally official government policy in America since Kissinger. They want us to be so miserable that we kill ourselves.

If you read the book Understanding Understanding by Humphry Osmond, you will recognize that they already knew our psychiatric model does not work all the way back in the 1960s. They want us to murder ourselves, like Augustine faulted Judas for. They only want to extract the last few cents from you like oil from a seed. Psychiatry is incompetent and unable to help a human being because it operates on a reductionist and deductive axis. It is intrinsically dehumanizing and violent, and objectifying. They will take your humanity away from you if you want to die, they will treat you like less than nothing.

The internet is a source of extreme suffering. It is better to read books. I am drowning in nihilism, and I have been for several months. I want to stop suffering. I do not think even death will relieve me, sometimes. I do not see a redemption arc in my future. I do not have much hope left.

So I will listen to Joan Baez and cry for a few hours. Life is not really worth living in a world where public opinion is manufactured by shady figures in smoky rooms. The merchants of death who buy and sell our souls, who gamble on us like pawns in their game.. they sit atop their mountains of skeletons, and they point their fingers at us and they laugh. They laugh and laugh. They will have the last laugh because I cannot stop crying.

It is very easy to reduce a person to words on a sheet of paper. I am very sorry for the lack of accountability people have to ourselves and to each other. I am very sorry for the shamefulness of psychiatry and how prevalent dysfunction is in our world. I do not think our problems will ever be solved. The internet is a weapon of mass destruction. Television is a weapon of mass destruction. I am surrounded by people who are hopelessly brainwashed. Nobody is really capable of the leadership that is necessary to save our world. Isn't that right?

It is very easy to call a person crazy. It is very easy to discard an entire human being. It is very easy because our society is built upon our alienation from ourselves. The American empire is criminally violent. Psychiatry is criminally violent. Wouldn't it be great if we had a leader to look up to? There is nobody who will become a hero.

The simple truth is that healthcare and coercion are mutually exclusive concepts. But people who have been violated by psychiatry are viewed as needing it evermore. It is a perfect con because the more they wreck a person's soul the more they can insist upon the necessity of their interventions.

For profit healthcare has to be one of the most evil things to ever exist in the history of humankind. It is simply exploitative. Do you see people calling out hospitals and healthcare providers for the role they play? Of course not... they are wolves in sheep's clothing. Nobody knows what to do. It is pathological. There is literally nothing anyone can do to affect a change that is good. We all have blood on our hands. The merchants of death who run our economy wick the blood off their hands and it splatters all over all of our faces. We could have a world without war... So much of our suffering is so, so unnecessary.

I feel sick.

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea is so wrongly maligned. The stranglehold that the media has on popular culture is homicidal towards creativity and human dignity.

We live in a culture of pointless gossip and lies. Everything is so meaningless. There is a war on the general public. We will probably never get the truce we desperately need. Every person who tries to change has his purpose suffocated or gets murdered. The house always wins. Sad.


I don't understand how people go through life and remain innocent. There are people who are really happy in this world, aren't there? I do not think I am capable of that emotion anymore. Wouldn't it be great to go to paradise?

Yes, Kim Jong-Un was right when he said that it does not matter who is in office because the political climate in America never changes... He is right about many things.. I think it is very sorry how many rumors are accepted as valid truths. Propaganda is propagated so pervasively in my country that is almost impossible to recognize the difference.

I am very one of a kind. It is not good to be special. The nail that sticks out gets hammered down. Isn't that true? I have always been different. It would be so nice if I could feel understood. But that experience does not exist in the spectrum of my humanity. My heartbeat is out of sync with meaning.",,,,,,,,,,,,

You cannot buy SN as an individual (only commercial purposes) in Australia.
You also can NOT order SN to Australia.
You can try. The sellers overseas will warn you but will still post it.
When it arrives in Australia it will be flagged and stopped at the border by Australia Border Force and two cops will be sent to destination of the package for a welfare check. They will come knocking at your door. The SN will remain with ABF.
You can try calling them(ABF) beforehand but when I did they said it's probably fine then all THAT still happened.

Hi... I just want vent about my likely CTB (I speak Spanish),2439919,gabmor4,"Apr 2, 2024 at 2:33 AM","If you want, you can use the automatic translate.
No me expreso bien en inglés, pero quería escribir algo aquí y aportar al foro; dejar de ser espectadora, como siempre. Quería agradecer a la comunidad por tanto apoyo. Antes ingresaba en anonimato y, aunque no interactuaba, me sentía acompañada, sentía calidez de parte de todos, o por lo menos quería creer eso. Muchas veces me sentí mejor luego de visitar a SaSu. Indagaba bastante en los foros, hasta que decidí registrarme, porque quería ser de ayuda en lo que pueda ser de ayuda. Solo ahora me animé a escribir.
Últimamente estuve pensando mucho sobre el CTB, esto es difícil. Quiero estar tranquila con mi decisión, por lo que es algo que reflexiono mucho. Sé que cuando me vaya, mi entorno se sentirá mal, decepcionado de lo que hice, y pensar en ese posible futuro me da pesadez y hace que me cueste decidir, porque, de verdad, no quiero que ellos sufran. Aunque quiero que no sufran por su pérdida, yo también quiero dejar de sufrir todo esto.
Me molesta tener la necesidad agobiante de querer justificar por qué me siento horrible con esta existencia, ¿por qué tengo que justificar esto? ¿Por qué tengo que dar justificación a mi deseo de querer descansar? Bueno, supongo que es consecuencia de sentirme culpable por todo y querer satisfacer a los demás.
Es difícil planificar todo, porque realmente quiero organizar lo suficiente para que los que amo estén lo más tranquilos posible dentro de lo que es la pérdida de un ser querido (y aún más por esta situación: el suicidio). No quiero culparlos por esto y no quiero que se sientan culpables por esto, aunque es cierto que no puedo controlar cómo vayan a reaccionar a mi decisión.
Me gustaría saber cómo planificar todo y sentirme en paz. Quiero grabar videos para quienes más amo y aprecio, y no quiero dejar recuerdos tristes para ellos. Quiero planificar bien el método, porque sé que con benzos es difícil (practiqué) y que cortarme no es una opción, porque comparto departamento con otras personas y no quisiera que me encuentren ensangrentada. También tengo en cuenta la posibilidad de que eso no funcione y me complique a futuro. Colgarme tampoco. No puedo conseguir un arma, aunque tampoco es una opción. Entre esas opciones, la que más me convence son los benzos. Parece ser la forma menos dolorosa y rápida, ¿no?

La verdad es que me siento muy identificado contigo, yo también frecuentaba este foro de forma anónima pero nunca participaba, no sé la razón, quizá mi introversión, mi apatía, o la sensación de que verbalizar mis pensamientos iba a aportar poco o nada. De hecho he empezado ayer a escribir algún comentario, precisamente por la misma razón que tú, la necesidad de involucrarme con algo por una vez y dejar de ser un espectador. Sólo quería decirte que no tienes que justificar cómo te sientes ni sentirte culpable por las emociones que estás experimentando ahora mismo, las emociones son, no se hacen, lo único que puede hacer una persona con respecto a eso es regularlas. En tu caso tú no tienes la culpa, sólo quería dejar claro eso, me pareces una persona muy inteligente y seguro que tú misma sabes muy por dentro que no la tienes. Apostaría que, al igual que yo, tienes esa maldita vocecita interna que intenta echarte la culpa de todo, si ese es el caso, no dudes en mandarla a la mierda, NO tienes la culpa.
Con respecto a lo demás no sé que aconsejarte. El tema de los seres queridos es muy complicado y ahí no puedo meterme, ni yo mismo sé que hacer la verdad. Y tampoco conozco muchos métodos para ctb.
Siento mucho no poder ser de más ayuda, como he dicho, soy un negado para estas cosas...y para muchas más al parecer.
Espero poder haberte acompañado, al menos torpemente, mientras lees mi comentario. Aunque sea para hacerte sentir que no estás sola, porque no lo estás. Mucha gente nos econtramos sintiendo lo mismo, yo me incluyo. Es curioso, tan lejos y tan cerca al mismo tiempo.
He visto tu post desde mi móvil, como suelo hacer a esta hora, desde mi cama, intentando reunir el agotamiento necesario para poder conciliar el sueño. Te escribo esto porque sentía que tenía que hacerlo, no sé por qué exactamente.
Y ahora sí, se me cierran los ojos, intentaré no luchar contra mis párpados, con el fin de caer en un profundo sueño con la ingenua esperanza, quizá, de no despertar.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Tenés razón, tan lejos y tan cerca, y aun así con emociones, sentimientos, circunstancias tan parecidas. En cierta forma es bueno saberlo, al menos para mí. Sentir este tipo de compañía me da tranquilidad.
Con respecto a que hayas sentido que escribir tus pensamientos aportaría poco o nada, quisiera decirte que, aunque aportases poco, ese poco tal vez sea suficiente para alguien. En mi caso, me alegra que hayas respondido.
Y aunque no sepamos o estemos indecisos con los métodos para ctb, aprenderemos, supongo, je. Espero que puedas descansar, ahora que duermes (creería) y próximamente. Espero que encontremos descanso.

I received my SN today. I'm feeling happy and secure about that. As much as I want to go out now though, I need to wait till like March. I feel like it's too close to the holidays already and my sibling has a birthday in February. I dont know if my death will really impact anyone, buy I don't want to ruin anything and I want people around me to have a happy holiday and what not.

Anyways, that got off topic. My only question is for people who have ordered from DMC, if they can lend me help. So my packaging came in like this silver pouch, it says what it is on a little label sticker and has a warning as well and I can just tear it across to open. I'm not opening it till my chosen date since I have no means of preserving it, but for people who have opened it already, is it vacuum sealed? It feels like it but i can't tell if there's air in it. Some of it is in a hard block but I can move it around and here some free sediments inside. I might just be paranoid, especially since this packaging is different from when I ordered when they were MDS, so it was all unexpected. Also, did it test and come out okay? I will test it myself before I ingest it, but it'll really suck to wait all this time for it to not be real. Thanks for any help in advanced.",,,,,,,,,,,,

There's a lot of posts on here about shelf life of SN but I haven't read much of it & don't have a definitive answer. I just know if I hadn't tested it, the anxiety would've killed me so it was worth it for me. Especially as the other one stayed sealed.

My main worry is getting a welfare check, since I don't quite know if I'll be able to fool the cops into thinking everything is fine. I could tell the truth and say it's for suicide, but that my therapist and I have a deal that I can keep a method on hand as long as I promise not to use it/keep it as a last resort (not an uncommon arrangement between therapist and patient). I'm not sure if saying it's for curing meat will be convincing, and I'm not sure how to cook up a story that would make that convincing.

Does anyone know if someone's gotten a welfare check in the US after ordering from DMC?

The only post I've seen of such a case is when a user's roommate found their package and called the cops, but this won't be a concern for me. I'm also aware that welfare checks tend to be more of a concern in places like the UK or Canada, and also when a source gets busted and everyone's addresses and receipts fall into law enforcement's hands. This happened when Kenneth Law got caught. People in both the US and Canada got welfare checks. And unfortunately, DMC also stores customer info, so if he gets busted and some of us haven't used our SN by then, we should expect a visit from our friends in blue.

That was such an awful story to read, and I hate that you had to go through that. Are you doing okay now? I can't imagine having my SN taken away like that, and then being 5150'd (that's the term, right?).

As for the arrival of the package, that is also reassuring to hear, although the family member with whom I live wouldn't really care about the package if they happen to find it first. They already know and accept that I've long planned on CTB, and I'm not even sure if they'd know what SN is anyway.

There is absolutely nothing suspicious looking about the packaging from DMC & mine clearly hadn't been opened & if it had, there's still nothing illegal in there. Just a discrepancy between the description on the outside to the description on the inside. And if they opened THAT layer & tested it, it is what it says on the inside packaging. Which is legal & could be written off as a clerical error on the exterior packaging. I think the UK have had some issues at some point because of the BBC & I don't know much about that or about the US, but there was zero interest in mine (& we have whole reality tv shows about the shit customs & border force intercept).

"I've just placed my order with DMC, and I could really use some reassurance.",2659857,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 6, 2024 at 12:54 AM","That is true. In the US, SN hasn't been made illegal yet (though the government is working on it, unfortunately). So if they happened to open it, there'd be nothing to flag the shipment. From my tracking updates, my SN went through Ukraine customs with no issue in only 14 hours or so. The only thing left is to hope it does the same for US customs.
That is a question I have. Does DMC inside packaging (the actual SN) say it is SN? I recall seeing a pic of it and it was a plain gray vacuum sealed bag (which also worries me, in case I fail and I need to have the rest of my SN properly sealed for the next attempt). I'm hoping it's a container or at least a resealable bag.
Yeah the UK is where it seems to be the most risky from what I've seen over the years. And after the MDS fiasco, I'm sure they're on higher alert for SN shipments. But in the US, it seems there isn't too much attention on SN aside from the so-called Youth Poisoning Protection Act. It passed the house earlier this year, and it now needs to pass the senate before going to the president. You can track the progress here: https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/4310 in case you see any posts about SN from users in the US and you feel they should be made aware of it. This is incredibly important for the future of SN acquisition here, and I feel as though I've just barely ordered my SN in the nick of time.

"I've just placed my order with DMC, and I could really use some reassurance.",2659993,DOHARDTHINGS24,"Sep 6, 2024 at 4:44 AM","It's in a grey vacuum bag like you said. It has the chemical abbreviation written on it, I think maybe in handwriting. So maybe have a google of what DMC sells it for so you sound like you have a great new hobby . I'm pretty confident it's resealable. TBH, I barely remember - getting a hold of a Mylar bag or whatever they're called wouldn't hurt if you're planning on opening it to test. Have a look on here on how to store if you open. I immediately destroyed all the outer packaging, the envelope, the stamps, ripped it into pieces, covered it in hand sanitiser until it was illegible, wadded up in a tiny ball, bagged it & binned it - I went all out. If I manage to successfully CTB (oh please, & soon ) it will be obvious what I used, but I wanted to protect the source - I had a lot of trouble with all of this, out of sheer panic & ignorance & lack of tech skills & was just generally rubbish & L from DMC was so ridiculously kind & patient with me, just endlessly lovely & was a godsend - so I didn't want him implicated. And I wanted to protect the source for future people who will need it. Felt responsible somehow. Something for you to think about maybe - not telling you what to do at all, I promise - I just really felt the need to keep the source open because I know how completely desperate I was & don't want to take that away from anyone else. I never encourage anyone else, but I know for some people it's their only choice. It's my only choice. CTB""ing & SN as method.
Mine sat at our customs for a really long time & that freaked me out, but it was fine. So maybe keep the adrenaline & anxiety in check if you can (I couldn't!!!!) it doesn't necessarily mean anything more than a lot of stuff at the docks.
Plus I think there was a lag from when it dropped from DMC tracking to when it started in my country.
I'm lucky (we're literally called the lucky country ) that I come from the same country as Philip Nitschke - first doc in the world to give legal lethal injection, founder of Exit, creator of the exit bag & sarco device etc etc., on & on.
Plus SN as a method (I believe…) was our gift to the world - too many feral pigs so when looking how to cull humanely, found SN & there was a quote ""They take a mouth full or two of bait and say, 'Oh that's making me feel a bit woozy', walk away to sort of snooze it off, and while they're sleeping it off, they just go into a deeper and deeper slumber and die"" - which obviously caught a LOT OF attention. That said, it's bloody hard to get here, I obviously shipped it from overseas & outright begged on this site for help. But luckily (again) no interest from customs.
Also, I tested with aquarium strips & blood test because as soon as the anxiety about it getting here disappeared, I got to replace that with a new all-consuming anxiety (there is always a new goddamn anxiety) that it wasn't legit. Both came out great. If I'd known I'd have long enough to get a second source, I would've but didn't know that at the time.
I started to reread this to edit & realised it's a rambling mess with a hundred maybes & a thousand I thinks, so I'm very sorry but instead of editing, I'm just gonna hit send & hope that you can find something useful amongst all of that.

Thank you so much for reminding me of this. I didn't even think of having the source compromised with the info on the packaging. When I do CTB, I will do all I can to remove any reference or trail back to DMC. I, too, really want to keep this source available for more people.
Got it. I will try to remain calm. But you know how anxiety can be, it'll just happen if that's your tendency. I'm definitely an overthinker lol
Fascinating! I am grateful to your country then, since SN is such a boon in the absence of Barbiturates.
This is why I'm likely not going to test, as I already mentioned. So many have tested DMC's SN and successfully CTB'd with it that I feel it would be a waste of my money. Plus, I'm pretty much pinching for pennies living paycheck to paycheck, so a $20 testing kit would be a significant purchase especially considering I also have to pay like $50 for Meto and Propranolol as well.

But the amount of people who come back frustrated or have to continually update threads saying ""oh i tried this, didn't work. gonna try something else to get it to work"" or ""got close this time, but failed"" and all that sort of speaks to how unreliable these methods are (partial hanging is another method of this sort). The stars have to align, and they're not likely to.

But, of course, like with partial, there's little to lose in trying except your time and finite motivation to CTB. I know I absolutely drained all of my willpower trying to get partial to work, to no avail.",,,,,,,,,,,,

SWB Method,2657973,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 4, 2024 at 3:28 PM","Well, I can't think of any dangers of doing this, but I'm not a medical professional and I'm only aware of the medical effects of the methods I've researched. But the way SWB's fainting method works doesn't appear to cause any brain damage if done outside of water. You basically eliminate all the CO2 from your bloodstream by hyperventilating, and then while holding your breath, your oxygen supply runs out before the amount of CO2 buildup activates your hypercapnic response, thus you pass out. But as soon as you pass out, your body will begin breathing again and you wake up shortly after, so no brain cell damage there. But this is extremely difficult to pull off, so if you're gonna be trying it in water for real, you're likely gonna fail over and over again. I recall a guy hyperventilating for up to 10 minutes (according to him) and getting underwater, only for him to never lose consciousness before he needed to take a breath. He tried this numerous times, to no avail. If you do manage to pass out underwater, depending on how much water you're submerged in, you have no way of knowing what your body will do while you're unconscious and you may resurface your face and get some air in. It's all very much ""in theory"" rather than anything concrete and surefire. This is why I suggest not doing it, similar to partial hanging. It'll likely only end up in frustration and wasted effort.

How do I ask around for SN without being suspicious?,2661139,figcitylightscookie,"Sep 7, 2024 at 3:00 AM","I live in Jordan, and I'm not sure if SN is illegal here. I tried looking it up online, but since Jordan is a -not so tech savvy- third world country, I couldn't find anything. I found some online SN sources, but they say they can't ship it to my country (it was a quick Google search, so I don't think they're reliable sources. I'm only saying this to explain why I'm assuming SN could be illegal here). I looked on Facebook and found 1 person from Jordan asking where to buy it; he asked twice: his first post was ignored, and he got an answer on the second post. His posts are 3 years old, so I'm not sure if the answer still checks out (also, people tend to just say random shops' names when they don't actually know if they have the wanted item or not, so I'm assuming the guy who answered just said the name of the only chemicals store he knew). A bit unrelated, but I found a post from an Egyptian group also asking for SN, and someone replied: ""If I were an admin, I'd ban you right now."" Someone asked him what was wrong with the question, but he never responded. I'm not sure if it's known here that SN is a suicide chemical, and I could get in legal trouble if someone knew I was going to use it to commit suicide.

The only option I believe I have is to go around and ask chemical stores if they have SN (either through their Facebook pages or in-store). However, if SN is illegal, I don't have any excuse to protect myself. Usually, when I buy things I don't want others to know are for me, I say I'm buying them for a friend. However, I'm scared they'll ask why my friend would want SN. I know it's used for food preservation, but what homemade foods would need SN to be preserved? I read here that when someone ordered SN, the box said something about it being a pottery material, but I couldn't find anything about SN actually being used for pottery (or any crafts in general).

But see, your cousin is starting a small business of homemade sausages and he just realized he needed something to conserve it, since you were at his house today he asked you if you could buy SN for him. Maybe you actually forgot the name of the 'thing' and have to check your notes. Also, he saw online it needed to be <95% pure. Why? You don't know, it's for your cousin. Ask ""Do you guys sell it here?"". Be chill, look confuse if they ask more questions, all you know is that your cousin wants it for his sausage business. If something sounds off, just leave the place. They probably won't mistreat you or ask too much because it's obvious you don't know anything more.

"Lasik destroyed my eyes, in constant pain and bound to my apartment",2575268,dumed1,"Jun 26, 2024 at 7:58 AM","I've been suicidal before, but never registered an account here until now. About a year ago, I came out of a major depression and decided to get lasik. Maybe because I was a bit manic after having overcome depression, I didn't do as much research as I'd normally do about such a serious procedure, and I think I would have never gotten it if I had fully read and understood the risks. But I did get it, and it was great for awhile, but then my eyes suddenly became so dry that I have to constantly put in eye drops (many times per hour) and can't go outside almost at all, or my eyes will dry out. If do go outside or neglect the eyedrops, my eyes will be in pain for days and my vision will permanently deteriorate in weird ways. Worst of all, it doesn't seem like this condition is treatable, or that any doctor even knows what's wrong exactly - all they know is that lasik severed my corneal nerves, and thus my tear glands don't produce tears anymore, or at least tears that are good quality.

I can't do most of the things that make life worth living, except hang out with my girlfriend, who is a saint and hasn't left me (yet). But she wants to go out, and I can't do that. I see myself becoming a bitter, complaining person who is always in pain and can't do basic things. I see myself losing all my friends and my girlfriend. I can see myself losing my job and then my healthcare.

I fear becoming blind and not being able to commit suicide beforehand. I really don't want to be alive if I'm blind. I am 37, I don't know how to be a blind person, and I will not be able to learn how to navigate the world or find community. Who would take care of me? I have no real family. I also really like visual information, and my brain would be moving way too fast for auditory information to keep me engaged. I'd probably end up wishing for death constantly, even more than I already do due to my eye problems. And I've had suicidal thoughts even when my body was healthy!

So, I've decided to start planning to CTB in parallel to getting treatment that will hopefully help me (but is a long shot, as there is no real treatment for this, only management). That way, if my vision deteriorates, I will be able to end my life before I become a blind man with no one around to help him.

In the past, I wanted to use the nitrogen exit bag method, since it seemed to be the most peaceful. But I'm not sure that this is good for my current situation, as a nitrogen tank is too big to hide from others and might be hard to acquire and set up if I'm near-blind (the other stuff, like the exit bag and the regulator/tube is small enough to be kept hidden). Another method I looked at is SN, which can be kept hidden, but it's much less appealing to me, especially since I have to take an anti-emetic and might still puke. Seems not very peaceful, AND the ingredients seem hard to source. I just wish I could buy a firearm, but I live in one of the few jurisdictions in the US where purchasing any gun is illegal without special permission.",,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lasik destroyed my eyes, in constant pain and bound to my apartment",2575336,dumed1,"Jun 26, 2024 at 9:18 AM","It really sucks because I was actually doing much better with regards to my depression. I had gotten a girlfriend for the first time in 5 years, things were going great with her, and I had a large group of friends that I was hanging out with and becoming closer to. I was even considering becoming a parent. For the first time in my life, life was really great. And then this health issue completely destroyed everything. I just wish I could go back in time and never get lasik. It's such a bad idea, even if this hadn't happened to me. It's a really destructive surgical procedure that's completely unnecessary. I was just so insecure about my glasses... and I really wanted to have perfect vision again. Such a waste of a wonderful life.

For those of you who primarily have mental issues, please know that these things can be fixed with medication, lifestyle changes, etc. I too once thought that I would be lonely forever and wouldn't be able to survive without company. And yet, after I got over my last depressive episode, I was able to build a very good life up until 1 month ago. But this is just too much. I can't just sit around in pain watching my vision deteriorate.

My only concern is for my girlfriend. She would be really sad if I killed myself. But, she's already really sad about what's happening to me, can't sleep, is constantly worried, etc. I feel like such a burden to her, and she would be long-term happier if I was gone, I think.
I too thought I would never get a girlfriend, because I am pale and bald and ugly. That's one of the reasons I was so set on getting lasik. But actually my girlfriend had met me before I got lasik and thought I was cute with glasses - I just didn't have the courage to approach her, because my self-esteem was too low.

Don't make the same mistake I made! Appreciate what you have (your health, even if it's not perfect, if you don't have to constantly worry about it that's better off than me), put yourself out there, make friends, make relationships. I know it's not that easy, and it wasn't easy for me. But it's possible. And I believe you can do it.",2575330,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lasik destroyed my eyes, in constant pain and bound to my apartment",2576042,sanctions,"Jun 26, 2024 at 10:31 PM","Hey, fellow dry-eye sufferer here. I had PRK surgery 16 years ago and things were good for about a year. Then my vision started getting worse and I got chronic dry eye disorder. First my eye dr put me on refresh eye drops, which definitely help and I use it daily as needed. I also started eating tuna/salmon daily which helped. The first prescription he put me on was restasis, which did not help. Then he put me on Lotemax, which did help. It was some 4x a day regimen for a week, then 3x a day for a week, 2x for a week, 1x for a week. This helped tremendously. However, Lotemax is supposed to be used in short-term bursts like he prescribed, not on an ongoing basis. However, it is safe for ongoing use and my eye doctor made an exception for me. I've had to experiment with different schedules for taking the drug, and I've incorporated another prescription drug into the mix, xiidra, but my eyes are A LOT better and don't affect me much anymore. Maybe you'll have to experiment around, but my own routine is this:

day 1: lotemax (one drop in each eye) and refresh drops as needed
day 2: refresh drops as needed
day 3: xiidra (one drop in each eye) and refresh drops as needed
day 4: refresh drops as needed
day 5: xiidra (one drop in each eye) and refresh drops as needed
day 6: refresh drops as needed

then back to day 1.

btw I have to throw each lotemax bottle away after 7 uses because after that the effectiveness drastically deteriorates. My doctor has no idea why that happens, but it does.

What eyedrops and/or medications have you tried?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lasik destroyed my eyes, in constant pain and bound to my apartment",2576546,dumed1,"Jun 27, 2024 at 9:58 AM","I can't use refresh drops, they don't stay for long enough. I think my dry eye is very severe - my tears evaporate instantly, and I don't have much of them to begin with.

I use optase dry eye intense eye drops, which I have to use several times an hour, every hour. I've tried a bunch of other drops (refresh, systane complete, refresh relieva, retaine mgd, hylo gel, meibo). Meibo works decently well but it makes my vision really blurry, and I need another drop to go underneath meibo. Meibo replaces the oily layer of the tear film that I don't have anymore, and the other drop replaces the aqueous layer which I also don't really have anymore.

I'm on eysuvis, which is like a much more expensive lotemax. It helps with the symptoms, but my eyes are still really dry. And I can't use it for much longer. At that point, I'm pretty sure pain will return.

I'm using cequa eye drops, which make my eye burn, but it doesn't look like they actually DO anything to increase my tear production or the quality of my tears. I'm taking omega3 supplements, but that's not doing anything. I'm trying manuka honey, which stings so much it makes my eyes water, but it's low quality tears that evaporate fast. So, I don't know if it's worth it. But it seems to have anti-inflammatory properties, so maybe it will help?

It seems like whenever I find something that works, even if it's ridiculous like wearing goggles to go outside, my condition gets worse and that no longer works well enough. Now I need fully-sealed goggles in order to go outside, which means they fog up almost instantly and are really unpleasant to wear. Since the outdoors is my happy place, the place that I used to go to escape feelings of depression and suicide, I don't know how much longer I can tolerate my condition. Maybe if I was mentally healthy before this happened, I'd be able to live on with a severely reduced quality of life, and stay positive. But this is just too much, I think.

Still, even with all these symptoms, RIGHT NOW I don't want to die. Maybe it's my girlfriend's support. Maybe it's my friends' support. Maybe it's that I'm curious about what the future will bring (societally and for my friends and family, even if I'm just an observer). Maybe it's because I finally figured out a way to sleep through the night. But I suspect this will wear on me, especially since it's hard for me to go outside and get exercise. I guess if I died right now I wouldn't be too disappointed, but I'm not at a point where I definitely want to die.

I'll be making exit bags later today because it makes me feel better knowing there's a way out from dealing with this pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,

These things didn't help me much but they help some. There's a doctor in Boston named Dr. Hamrah who deals with people who have been damaged by lasik. He can look at your corneal nerves with a special microscope to see whats going on, and prescribe a protocol of eyedrops to encourage the nerves to grow back.

I wish i could give you a hug. I have nothing helpful to say about what you should or shouldn't do, just that im so sorry the world is so hard sometimes.

"Lasik destroyed my eyes, in constant pain and bound to my apartment",2580044,dumed1,"Jun 30, 2024 at 8:07 AM","I currently take it twice a day. Even with the eysuvis, I have to put in drops every 30 minutes or so to avoid pain. My eyes don't seem to produce much of their own tears, but I am going to a doctor soon who will confirm or deny this. I got some moisture chamber glasses that I can use to go outside, but they fog up (that's the point of them), and I still have to put in drops all the time, maybe even more frequently than every 30 minutes. My vision keeps getting worse, I'll need glasses again, but I'd need a new prescription every week. This doesn't feel like a life worth living, to me.

Looking at a computer is tough, looking at my phone is tough. Without anything to distract me, I am alone with my thoughts, and my thoughts have always been terrible. I've been suicidal before even when my life was objectively great, and now it's objectively horrible.

I want to commit suicide. But then when I envision putting the exit bag or gas mask over my head, turning on the nitrogen tank, and falling asleep forever... I feel disgusted, and I want to live. But my life is also excruciating and boring and hard and painful and full of guilt, so I want to die. And on and on it goes...

I talked with my girlfriend about thoughts of suicide and now SHE can't sleep and is very worried. She told me she would kill herself if I killed myself, or that she would be traumatized for years. This is horrible, she might be right. I feel like a huge burden to her and that she would be much better off if I died, but maybe my suicide would make her life even worse than it is now. I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Even with all of this, there are some brief moments in life that are still enjoyable, like cuddling with the girlfriend, cooking a meal together, watching a movie (although this is becoming harder as my vision is getting worse). But I can feel the depression moving in, taking away joy from everything. And when it's fully taken over my mind, I don't know if I can continue living. I just don't think I'm resilient enough to handle something like this. I always thought that I would die from suicide once I developed a serious medical condition that made life much harder, I just didn't think it would happen in my late 30s.",2578506,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lasik destroyed my eyes, in constant pain and bound to my apartment",2581787,YourEarthRoommate,"Jul 1, 2024 at 6:54 PM","I can't even imagine how devastating this has been for you. Honestly, my heart hurts reading everything that you've written here. I have struggled both with suicidal ideation and debilitating dry eyes, though not related to one another. I've also witnessed what suicide does to those you leave behind, and been incapacitated from an injury that eliminated my ability to walk. I would love to give you some sincere, yet candid perspective / advice with that in mind. I know this is long, but I have a lot to say.

First, and I know this is the last thing you want to hear right now, but it's 100% true and critical to recognize; you are lucky and fortunate more than you realize. I can tell from that last post alone. The human brain can be cruel by pointing your attention to everything that's gone wrong and how unfair it is. This issue significantly affects every aspect of your life, so how could you not think about it 24/7? I understand what it feels like to have everything impacted by a disability you didn't deserve, and it's grueling. I have serious compassion for you. That said, I would give my left fucking arm for a partner who was so compassionate, supportive, loving, and committed to stick by my side like that. Holy shit dude. She cares so so so much for you. There are people who live their whole lives without having anyone feel that way for them, and I'm jealous of you for finding her. Even though it's sour to hear someone tell you to be grateful... dude. Be grateful for her and tell her you love her. Even though it's difficult, intentionally focusing on the parts of life that are good takes power away from things that are bad. The inverse of that is also true.

Another traumatic thing we do to ourselves when facing disability is to compare our loftiest expectations and dreams of what life could have looked like, with the most pessimistic and hopeless guess at what life will look like ""now."" For example, when I lost the ability to walk, I could NOT STOP THINKING about how I wasn't going to be able to workout anymore, play racquetball, go on walks, be an attractive partner, walk my daughter down the aisle, etc etc etc. I had so many plans that were ""taken"" from me, and it was crushing. As months went by though, I started to realize that my life wasn't necessarily ruined, it was just altered. While those consequences were real, I had different opportunities present themselves that were beneficial. For example, I joined a wheelchair basketball league and made the best friends of my life there. I would have never have met those people had this not happened, and although I'm not grateful to be in a wheelchair, I'm grateful to have them. In your situation, this may look something like artistic expression. I know you're not blind, but when you lose your vision, your brain adapts and senses other than sight are enhanced. You could leverage that and dive into writing music, mastering an instrument, writing a book or poetry, making pottery by feel, designing custom and designer perfumes, etc. You're truly only as limited as you perceive yourself to be. I really want you to believe that.

Also realize that making an effort like that would encourage and impress your girlfriend more than you know. She sees how difficult this is for you, and would be inspired and proud beyond words to see you make that effort. Rather than being a burden on her, you're in a position to show her what a man does in the face of undeserved adversity: persist, endure, achieve, and eventually, thrive. Should you leave us, her life would be irreparably scarred. She would be plagued with doubts of ""Was I not supportive enough?"" ""Why didn't I get him help?"" ""Did I say something that pushed him over the edge?"" ""Was I not enough for him to live for?"" and on and on and on. I've seen it, and it's many years of self-blame and guilt at a minimum. If it were up to me, you would make the effort to ""grow through the concrete,"" be an inspiration for her, and find pride in the person looking back from the mirror.

Finally, I want to address your eyes. I had a few years where my eyes were so dry that my eyelids would stick to my eyeballs when looking around. Thankfully it resolved with time, which should be a hopeful anecdote. I learned a lot about treatment options in that time.

1. Those glasses are life savers, but you need to use an anti-fog coating on them. Get some FogAway. I'm not sure which glasses you have now, but Ziena makes the best ones. They cost a bit, but they're worth their weight in gold. Super comfortable, inconspicuous, and they seal really well.

2. You should also be using cyclosporine eye drops morning and night. You're using cequa which is cyclosporine, but its more expensive and causes the burning you mentioned due to the carrier fluid. It claims to be faster acting than generic cyclosporine, though that's debatable and inconsequential for long term treatment. You can order generic cyclosporine drops (aka Restasis) online from sources overseas for pennies on the dollar (alldaychemist). Note that it can take up to 3 months for cyclosporine to be fully effective, but it's absolutely worth the commitment.

3. It's my uneducated opinion that you should keep using the eyesuvis or even up it to lotemax (higher concentration), at least until other treatments start working maximally. It reduces inflammation, but through a different mechanism of action than cyclosporine, so their effects are additive. I would recommend letting your doctor know where you're at mentally and getting another prescription. You could also check the source I mentioned. The consequences of continued use should be monitored by a doctor, but generally aren't acute. You're mainly looking at increased intraocular pressures and potential cataract formation, but those take time to occur (if they do), and can be prevented if your doc is monitoring you.

4. Get punctal plugs, top and bottom. The puncti drain your tears down though your nasal passages. You can have a doctor put a tiny plastic plug in them so your tears last longer on your eyeball; this made a huge difference for me. You can feel them on the surface of your eye for a couple days, but your brain soon ignores the sensation.

5. You should also try scleral lenses. They are contacts that sit on the sclera (white part) of your eye rather than the cornea. They have a small liquid reservoir between the lens and cornea which keeps the eye hydrated. They don't work for everyone and I haven't tried them myself, but many swear by them.

6. Use a humidifier or two at home and monitor the indoor humidity. This will let you to function more normally which is huge for morale. Even if you still have to use drops, it will be less often. I've even used one in my car before and it helps tremendously. Whole-home steam humidifiers are best, but you can go with an ultrasonic one with distilled water (important) to start. Also consider a high quality HEPA air purifier. They suck an astonishing amount of crud out of even the cleanest homes.

7. Take a high quality omega-3 supplement and eat salmon often. Tere's research that proves it's efficacy at thickening the lipid layer of your tears.

8. Drink plenty of water. I've noticed that my eyes get much more dry when I'm not hydrating intentionally.

9. Get a microwavable heating pad like this https://a.co/d/0faAL0sZ. It's not a cure, but the heat encourages tear production and reduces soreness. It's a luxurious experience and something to look forward to as a break from the discomfort.

10. Be certain you are using preservative free eye drops rather than a bottle (the ones in little vials of 5 stick together). Optase dry eyes intense might be ok, but I would recommend you try Refresh Optive Advanced (https://a.co/d/03u4K9r9). They have 5 times the glycerine, 0.5% CMC, and polysorbate. Those last 2 ingredients aren't in yours and they are beneficial. CMC makes the drops last much longer due to it's viscosity. Polysorbate is a surfactant and emulsifier that helps the liquid spread evenly and stabilizes the lipid layer to reduce evaporation. The viscosity might not be as immediately refreshing as what you're using now, but they are significantly longer lasting. You could even use both.

11. Ask your doctor about autologous eye drops. They are eye drops made from your own blood, which sounds weird, but they work. The growth factors, proteins, vitamins, and lipids in them improve your eyes ability to heal, reduce inflammation and irritation, and provide superior lubrication to anything else you could buy.

I believe in the right to chose. If CTB is a conclusion someone comes to after careful consideration, they should feel empowered to make that choice. From my perspective though, that'd be a flat out mistake for you. You have hope for a beautiful future life with your girl, you've got dozens of avenues of personal expression and entertainment to explore, and there's many efficous treatment options you haven't tried that have worked for me personally, not to mention the possibility your body heals on its own. The difficulty you're going through now will sharpen your character, force you to grow, and give you something to be proud of yourself for! Don't stick around for your girlfriend, do it for yourself and the opportunities you still have.

I really wish you the best man. I took the time to write all this out because I deeply empathize with you. I know what disability feels like, and I know it's absolute hell, but I ALSO know there's countless beautiful, joyful, and rewarding days in your future that you would be foolish to miss out on. It's just difficult to see them right now.

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help. I'm here for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,

"Lasik destroyed my eyes, in constant pain and bound to my apartment",2583618,dumed1,"Jul 3, 2024 at 7:30 AM","I went to the doctor recently and got a bunch of tests:
- I am producing very few tears
- My tears evaporate instantly (TBUT = 0)
- I have inflammation in my tears still, despite the steroids
- I seem to have some inflammation underneath the lasik flap? Or some corneal issues there.
- Tyrvaya did nothing, it did not cause me to produce any tears

First of all, thank you so much for writing all of this out for me. I know how lucky I am, and I am doubly lucky that you took the time to register an account just to post all this life-affirming stuff. I tell her I love her all the time. But it's very hard for her to take care of me, and I don't want her life to end just because she's dating me. It's not a very long relationship, it just moved very fast.
Yes, it's true. I am grieving what my life could have been without getting lasik, compared to what it is now, and also the worst case scenario of losing my vision completely (it's declining rapidly). The problem with all the things you mentioned is that I don't enjoy any of them. Playing music is especially traumatic for me due to childhood abuse around music. I think the core problem is that I was already close to suicide even when everything was fine, and this disability is pushing me over the edge.

Making art is good and all, but I am not a very creative person. I did consider learning to draw, and that is still something that I could do.
Yea this would be the ideal. Unfortunately, as someone who had a lot of difficulty doing normal things in life before this, I am not sure that I would be able to step up. Even simply surviving is using up all my energy. Also, it's not clear that this adversity is undeserved - I shouldn't have gotten lasik, even if this dry eye situation hadn't happened, I would have still regretted my decision as my vision was not actually as stable as I hoped, I kinda tricked myself into believing that it was.
Yes I have the Ziena Kai. They are fine and they allow me to go outside and do things, as long as I put in eyedrops every 30 minutes or so. I have anti-fog wipes, which don't really seem to be doing much. I'll try fogaway.
I am using cequa because it's faster-acting. It's fine that it's expensive, I can easily afford it (another reason why my life was so awesome before all this started).
Yes I am continuing to use eyesuvis. I guess it's better to use that than to continue having everything be inflamed.
Bad idea when there's inflammation in my tears (which there is right now). It will trap the inflammatory cytokines on my eye and worsen everything.
Yes, it's on the list of things to try. But maybe a last resort. My eyesight is fluctuating / declining so quickly right now that I'm not sure what kind of scleral lense I should even get. It's also tricky to get scleral lenses if TBUT=0 and there's few natural tears in the eye. The scleral lens doesn't cover the entire eye, so the corners of my eye would still get very dry.
Yes this is all good advice, thank you. I do have a humidifier for the winter, but I am running the air conditioner right now so it doesn't really make sense.... Humidity is at 50% though, not too low.
Doing all of these, thank you. Will try the refresh optive advanced drops.
I'm getting these next week sometime.
Right now, I think the main problem is my attitude / major depression/anxiety being triggered as a result of my eyes. When I get depression, I end up contemplating suicide a lot, even when things are totally fine in my life. And I tell myself it's going to be ok, you're fine, everything is fine. But I can't really tell myself that right now. And I can't use a lot of the coping strategies I used to use, because they either involved looking at screens, going outside, or socializing, all of which are difficult for me right now.

And a lot of it is me blaming myself for getting lasik. I clearly had dry eyes beforehand, because I couldn't wear contacts for the entire day. I didn't think I had dry eyes because I never had to put in eye drops. But I should have done more research, and realized that my eyes were dry, and that getting lasik was especially risky for me. I always do a lot of research before doing anything. Except for this. What was I even thinking?

And also my eyes are getting a lot worse rapidly. I used to be able to put in eyedrops every 30 minutes, which was terrible, but... now they dry out almost immediately. If I put in meibo too, it can last 15 minutes maybe. But that's putting in 2 drops in every eye, every 15 minutes, the entire time I'm awake. If I use moisture seal glasses, that can be extended a bit, but they fog up.",2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787

I think you need to decide whether you are willing to live with the pain or without eyesight in order to be with your girlfriend. This sounds awful, but if they take your eyes out would the pain subside? Could you exist as a blind person and be happy or would that be too much to bare?

I would try to keep going to all the top Eye doctors and try a few things, although it may end up being pointless. If you live in Washington DC, wouldn't you be able to just move to a different location if you can lawfully do so and then keep whatever you get somewhere else (away from your girlfriend who could be impacted) and that way if things get worse you would have it? Or just pay the suicide clinic in advance? I understand your fears on losing eyesight completely and then being unable to find a good way to end things and being in pain and possibly being dependent on others and unable to die. Being trapped like that is a horrible situation. It sounds like you don't want to ctb right now, you want to live if there's any way to get better, but you want the option available.

You indicated your financial situation is alright. Can you go down the list of top eye hospitals and see at least a few?

Have you drawn up a will so that your girlfriend will have something if things get worse? Would that help her out? Have you talked to the clinics in Switzerland?

I'm so sorry. They need to warn people more about Lasik and the things that can happen with when it goes wrong.

So my recommendation would be salmon, egg yolks, cod liver, and any other liver like chicken liver. Don't eat the liver daily as it can cause vitamin A toxicity. Beta-carotine is not a real substitute of actual vitamin A as some people are very bad converters (from betacarotine to vitamin A).
Also, I notice that heat for me helps with tear production and tear quality so I shower hot water on my closed eyes and entire face daily. If this dry you out even more, then find other heat source.
Avoid all seed oils and margarine. If in a restaurant, ask them to use olive oil, butter or lard, if they have them, not seed (vegetable) oil. Some restaurants only have seed oils as they are tbe cheapest but they cause inflammation and correlated with various eye iaaues.

I was not aware that you can go blind from dry eyes. I am going blind due to the death of the optic nerve (glaucoma), which is permanent, but I also went blind in my life due to cornea failure which was sold with a cornea transplant.
I had about 15 eye surgeries so far. I am permanently on steroid drops due to the transplant.
I have an artificial iris, various shunts, iris missing, pupils unresponsive, lots of stuff going on but no dry eyes. But I did notice that if I don't do the heat treatment each day, I start to get dryer eyes. I do a very hot bath each day and then hot water on my closed eyes for a few minutes.
As far as inflammation, the ketogenic diet does bring down inflammation systematically in the whole body, I think it works stronger than some anti-inflammatory drugs, it will even stop joint pain and other inflammatory processes.
I definitely don't think that taking omega supplements are as effective as actually eating that salmon, egg yolks, cod liver, etc.

I've gone through many depressions and suicidal ideations, and have come close to purchasing the gear before, just due to mental issues / loneliness.

I felt like a failure, I was living with my abusive parents, jobless, friendless, etc. But because I didn't commit suicide, I was able to get a high paying job, become rich even, travel the world, make a bunch of friends, get a girlfriend, get an amazing apartment, etc. So for mental issues alone, I don't recommend suicide, as these tend to resolve with time, therapy, treatment, and lifestyle changes. I even tried every anti depressant treatment and it didn't work, but my depression still got better anyway, with time and lifestyle changes. So it gets better, I know that.

But dry eye... Dry eye gets worse. It's unlikely with my condition that I'll be able to live a normal life again.
You usually can't, but with the severity of my dry eye, it's very easy for the eye to completely dry out and then tear the cornea while blinking or moving the eye.
I am so sorry to hear this. Going blind is terrifying and eye problems in general cause depression more than other health issues (I've had other weird health issues and my eye problems feel much worse).

"Lasik destroyed my eyes, in constant pain and bound to my apartment",2586752,needthebus,"Jul 5, 2024 at 10:47 PM","My friend had complications from Lasik and has very dry eyes that are painful. Who is the best doctor on the planet for this problem?

Answer

For severe dry eye complications following LASIK surgery, it's crucial to consult a specialist with extensive experience in managing post-LASIK complications. While it's difficult to definitively name a single ""best doctor on the planet"" for this issue, there are several highly regarded experts in the field of corneal and external eye diseases who specialize in treating complex dry eye cases, including those resulting from LASIK complications. Some top specialists in this area include:

Dr. Stephen Pflugfelder at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. He is renowned for his research and clinical work on dry eye disease and ocular surface disorders
Dr. Edward Holland at the Cincinnati Eye Institute. He is a corneal specialist with expertise in complex anterior segment surgery and ocular surface diseases
Dr. Christopher Rapuano at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. He is known for his work on corneal diseases and refractive surgery complications

These specialists have extensive experience treating severe dry eye cases and are often sought out for complex post-LASIK complications. However, it's important to note that there are many skilled ophthalmologists and optometrists who specialize in dry eye treatment and post-LASIK care. For your friend's specific case, consider the following steps:

Seek a comprehensive evaluation from a corneal specialist or dry eye expert. They can assess the severity of the condition and recommend appropriate treatments

Explore advanced treatment options. These may include autologous blood serum drops, special contact lenses, or procedures to unblock oil glands
Consider combination therapies. Severe cases often require a multi-faceted approach, potentially including prescription medications, in-office procedures, and lifestyle modifications. Be patient with the treatment process. Resolving severe dry eye can take time, and the treatment plan may need adjustments along the way

If local treatments are not providing relief, consider seeking a second opinion or referral to a major eye center specializing in complex cases.

Remember, the ""best"" doctor for your friend will be one who not only has expertise in treating post-LASIK dry eye but also takes a personalized approach to their specific case. It may be beneficial to start with a highly regarded specialist in your local area or region, as ongoing care and follow-up will be important in managing this condition.

Yeah those hobbies aren't for everyone. You would definitely benefit from channeling yourself into something though. I learned how to play the drums and it's one of the best decisions I've made. I could watch myself get better too, which really built my self esteem.

Life can be cruel and I'm sorry you're struggling like this. When ""doing normal things"" is difficult, you're in a really rough spot. I know next to nothing about your real-life self, but from the little I've read here, I can picture you stepping up. In your own words: ""Because I didn't commit suicide, I was able to get a high paying job, become rich even, travel the world, make a bunch of friends, get a girlfriend, get an amazing apartment, etc."" You can't get much better evidence of capability than that. You're situations changed, but you're still that dude.

On your undeserved adversity point, it's bullshit and I address it later.

Hell, if I were you I'd order the top 10 on Amazon and keep trying until one worked. Don't have much to loose there.

I see. Did your doctor tell you that or did you find a source making that connection? From what I was able to find, it looks like the claim ""punctal plugs trap cytokines, thereby worsening symptoms"" is a hypothesis but not proven.

The Singapore Eye Research Institute actually conducted a study on this and concluded:
""Punctal plug occlusion provided symptomatic relief and reduced fluorescein staining in all except the inferior zone. However, insertion of punctal plugs had minimal effect on tear cytokines and MMP-9 levels, suggesting a need for earlier treatment with anti-inflammatory agents for management of dry eye disease.""

Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/scien...sing,ocular surface from ongoing inflammation

The study shows that punctal plugs don't help with inflammation of the eye (they don't decrease cytokine levels), but they do still decrease tear evaporation rate and relieve other symptoms of dry eyes. The conclusion from their perspective was ""punctal plugs are insufficient in treating ocular inflammation in patients with dry eyes,"" not that they were detrimental. I interpret this as: ""combination therapy would be needed to address information, but plugs are helpful for treating dryness.""

I'm not a doctor, but just intuitively, punctal plugs would need to have an effect on cytokine levels to cause any additional damage via that mechanism. If punctal plugs don't affect cytokine levels in typical eyeballs, they would presumably not affect cytokine levels in yours, despite them being high beforehand. I think you should research this more yourself, discuss this with your doc, or get a second opinion. I understand why you would be cautious, but remember, you can always just pull them out.

Interesting, I wasn't aware of that. I do still think they're worth trying, especially if money isn't a major factor. Though, you'd want a doctor who believes in their merits if you're skeptical. Like some others have said, finding a good specialty doctor would probably be worth it.

Do you think pushing it up to 70% is worth a shot? Your AC will pull the water out, but you could run a humidifier in your bedroom or living room to keep the RH elevated there.

Losing coping mechanisms is an extra insult to your literal injury. You really need an outlet of some kind. Something to be passionate about that's not affected by this. I hope you can find that.

That's just plain false and unfair. You did something to improve yourself (which is commendable) and got screwed. That's it. It's absolutely not your fault and it could have happened to anyone, mildly dry eyes or not. Dry eyes aren't even a disqualifying pre-condition. According to the Modern LASIK Outcomes study, only 1.2% of patients reported being ""dissatisfied"" with their surgery after 6 months (n=9726), and I'd wager a massive chunk of that was just inadequate correction.

Trust me I get how frustrating it is to try and find it. I'll only offer the advice to not bother with Google, DMC doesn't appear in Google results even with the complete name of the site.

After trying to find it ever since his original store was shut down (which I also found, but didn't order from while it was up), I finally found it a few days ago. After pondering for a few days, I decided to actually go ahead and make an order for 100g of SN (both because I am a larger person & because I want more than one chance at it).

It costed a lot more than I would have liked to pay, but its a price I was willing to pay for the relief of knowing I will actually have a way out if I come to the decision I want to take it. I am unlikely to use it as soon as I get it, I just want to know I have it in case things get too much for me. With fees and shipping, it cost me ~$120 Canadian to have it shipped to a PO box in Ontario. I didn't bother with paying extra for the express shipping since I won't be using it right away anyway.

Much to my surprise, my anxiety levels were not at the record high I expected when actually going through the ordering process. I was more concerned about screwing up Paysend than anything else (I used the ""to a bank account"" option, as the Mastercard/Visa options required information like his postal code which was not given).

I am a bit scared that customs might intercept my package and I'll get welfare checked, or worse get in trouble for smuggling (although I'd plead ignorance in either case). I do also have concerns around there being any other errors in the order process causing me to lose out on my order and the money I spent on it, but I'm far more worried about being caught.

I imagine that when I actually go pick up the package from the post office in a few weeks will be more anxiety provoking (although I do have a story made up in case the post office employee is chatty and curious about why I have a package from Ukraine). I am definitely worried about how I will bring the package home without any questions being asked by my family, although I've intentionally been more secretive about my packages' contents for some time now, so that I can keep any package's contents secret for any reason, not just ctb related things).

But the UK seems to be the worst offender for welfare checks so at least you've got that going for you, could be worse.

I'm not sure about customs though. But DMC is really good about shipping things properly and efficiently from what I've seen, so I don't believe you'll have any errors during the process.
Fortunately, DMC ships it discreetly, so they won't be able to tell what it is nor will those who reside in your home. And I can't imagine a package from Ukraine is suspicious.

Planning on taking mine sometime this winter most likely, probably after New Years or even potentially February. If I get cold feet I may just hold on to SN for longer since my parents are aging anyways and almost in their 70's as SN lasts quite a long time.

Worst case scenario it's nice knowing that there is always an ""out"" if your life spirals out of control, you develop a terminal illness, or your freedom is in jeopardy. Honestly though, I've been done with this existence for a solid year and things aren't going to get better, I also have heart issues and my body has begun retaining fluid due to them so in all honesty I doubt I'll make it past 40 (I'm 35 in a month by the way) and if I do make it to 40 I'll likely wish I was CTB anyways as my health will have further deteriorated.

The moment I receive my SN I'm going to celebrate and possibly even purchase a bottle of wine despite not being a big drinker these days by any means. I do know that if I had SN at the time I would have taken it for certain a few months ago when the most traumatic experience of my life happened.

Right now my life is pretty much in a limbo and it's likely going to stay like that for the foreseeable future. I have no obligations that make my life either pleasurable or painful in any way and everything is 5/10 across the board but that may be because I'm emotionally numb these days so it's difficult to even recognize when I should smile or frown anymore.

Was visiting my parents earlier today (who know I've been through severe emotional trauma) and now that I think about it I don't believe I showed any visible emotions whatsoever. My mom cries every time I leave because she knows I'm just a shell at this point and I'm beginning to wonder if they'd be either sad or relieved when I pass. I know that it's easy to assume they'd be sad but they know firsthand what I experienced so I highly doubt they would even be surprised in the slightest if I were to CTB and maybe then they could actually focus on themselves instead of supporting me because I'm a burden on them as my memory is beyond horrible (thankfully, in all honesty) so they have to help me pay bills and remind me of appointments or events.

I used to have no issue with these things but now they are an insurmountable challenge to navigate for me. Yeah, I can set alarms for every single thing but I don't always remember to charge my phone and I'm not on the computer all the time so I can't rely on that either.",2656893,,,,,,,,,,,

1 I just posted some very lengthy responses to @Plato'sCaveDweller (above) who has a similar thread. Some of that may be useful.
2 anyone else that struggles with PaySend (I did!!), I WhatsApp'd L from DMC & he was kind enough to send me a payment request for the right amount & it idiot-proofed the process (in case not clear, I'm the idiot in this story).
And
3 it wouldn't hurt to know what else could be coming from DMC's country in this climate - I don't think anyone would be suspicious but could be chatty & curious as you said (I did read that bit) -it's a weird country to buy from at the moment - I simply cannot lie to a direct question without planning in advance, so if it helps, it will be flat & be able to fit in a normal letterbox, so if you're anxious about it, do research on something that size from that country, just to put your mind at rest.

Stupid decision-Waiting to see what comes of it,2612536,willitpass,"Jul 28, 2024 at 8:35 PM","I've engaged in severe self-harm for years and years now. Above 4 years ago I got an idea in my head to cut myself and rub something fowl like feces into it to induce an infection and hope it turns septic and kills me. I've put off the idea for years, but today I just want to die. Unfortunately, the trauma caused by surviving my 3 major attempts in the past has me unable to overcome the SI required to actively CTB, so I've resorted to passive suicide methods like daily overdoses of OTC meds, chronic starvation, chronic dehydration, etc. Today the urge became too much. I cut myself on the part of the skin believed to harbor the highest amount of bacteria, rubbed an unspeakably disgusting substance into it, and taped it shut so the bacteria can't escape. Now only time will tell if it turns septic. If I see signs that I am going septic, I will not tell anyone. I will stay home and let myself fall into shock until I die. If it doesn't turn septic, then well I've just engaged in the most disgusting thing I've ever done in my life and I'll have to carry on.

Before anyone starts to lecture me, I work in healthcare. I am well aware of the process of developing an infection, the stages of sepsis, the symptoms, etc. I've been septic before due to a medical condition. I've cared for many patients with sepsis before and am aware of the implications of going into shock and surviving with permanent damage. I know this is an awful idea. And I also no longer care. I am tired of living but am unable to pull the trigger for an immediate and more guaranteed suicide despite having the means to do so thanks to the PTSD.

It's taken me decades to accept that I was supposed to fail at life. My life was never meant to be good.,2665774,ChildrensITV,"Sep 10, 2024 at 7:39 PM","This isn't to say I have given up fully, but in the last few weeks, I haven't tried to eek out of life what I was never supposed to get. I volunteer cuz I can't get a job and need something on my CV. I was already late for ""work"", cuz I prefer to stay up late and keep making the same mistakes, apparently, cuz I'm probably missing a chromosome. So I was running late for ""work"", and saw my bus go past in front of me. It is not a frequent bus. I got frustrated for a second - ""I'm gonna be EVEN LATER"" - then thought: ""Fuck it. Turn back home. Call work and say you're not coming in today"". Why stress myself? Either they will be okay with it or they will fire me. It's not as if having them on my CV has helped me so far anyway. It's better to have them on my CV than not, but I'm fucked either way.

Whether I'm volunteering or not, I'm FUCKED.

I used to go to the gym. My life is awful. But when life gets really bad, I can't be bothered to go. Every Monday, I tell myself: ""New week, time to get back into it"". Then I fail to go. ""Tuesday, it's not too late to start this week, although Tuesday is a busier day"". Then I fail to go. By Wednesday, I'm like: ""Maybe I might go or maybe I won't ...oh, it's getting late... I will try again next week"". But I'm old, ugly and balding anyway, so there is no rush. It's not really going to improve much anyway.

Whether I go or not, I'm FUCKED.

I want to get my career back on track cuz I need to buy things. I apply for jobs, get rejected. Sometimes I will be like: ""It's been 3 days since I last applied for a job, what the fuck am I doing"". But then I remember: Even if I had a job, my life would still be shit. I'd just be able to buy a few more distractions. And I'll probably be slow and shit at the job anyway and lose it.

Whether I try or not, I'm FUCKED.

My life was meant to be fucked. I get a job, I lose a job. I get a gf, I lose a gf. I am passionate about something, but I suck at it. I want to improve something, but I can't have or keep it. I kept saying to myself: ""I need to get a grip on life. It's getting late"". But recently, it dawned on me that the reason why my life keeps failing, is cuz it was never meant to be good. I was never meant to enjoy it. It was meant to fail. Those glimmers of hope I had - they weren't meant to happen, or if they were, it was only so they could be taken away from me. I was given hope so that there was something to snatch away from me.

Sometimes, when a lot of things fail at once, I'll just give up and sit down on a chair and reason: ""My purpose is just to sit down until I get cancer. Anything else achieved is a bonus. I was never meant to amount to shit. I am just here to suffer, be a mocked laughingstock, and hate my existence. Not everyone is here for a good purpose. Some people are born to be a brutal dictator and kill many. Some are born just to watch others live life, to eat food, shit, masturbate, be bald, be slow, be low-IQ, be mocked, browse Reddit and scroll X.""

I was born to be a background character. An extra. I'm ""lowIQ-ethnic-man #4"" during Act 485, Scene 1001 of some other guy's life. Maybe I was meant to die in a car-crash at 10, but I didn't go out that day and so the rest of my script is blank. That's why I can't get anything written on it. That's just the way it goes.

The only ""good"" thing about being a man/male is that, when your life sucks, there is no knightess in shining armour to help and save you. Get FUCKED. So I won't be having children and passing my shitty life onto anyone else. So at least I am containing the problem. And really, most of my problem is my genes, so it's GOOD that I can't be stupid enough to do such a thing.

Wrong IQ, looks, race, family, sex, biology, era, maybe even planet. I should have been an amoeba in 500 BC.

There is a certain relief in knowing that I am listening to the Universe now, instead of fighting so hard against it. You can't beat it anyway. All you can do is fight it unhappily. I've never been good at anything. No talent. No looks. No backbone. Nothing. But that's okay cuz one day, I will be dead.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I'll be doing the stat dose. But taking 40 mg of metoclopramide instead of 30. Also, I'll be doing 33 g of SN in approximately 100 ml of water instead of the recommended 25. I know that a higher quantity might make it more likely that I'll throw up, but I'll be preparing 3 glasses of 33 g SN total in case I throw up.

I want to use up all of my 100 g in this attempt, rather than saving a quarter of the SN or something which would be pretty useless. If it doesn't work this time, I'll just have to find a different method. Although I don't really have any access to any, so I'm really REALLY hoping this works.

Pierce jugular vein?,2665707,Old,"Sep 10, 2024 at 6:06 PM","Veins carry low pressure blood, if you were to cut the jugular, you would have a chance of dying, but also a chance that the blood will clot and the injury closes up. An artery transports blood at high pressure. So you would be better off cutting the carotid arteries.

Still not a good method. Don't recommend it. That's because it is too painful and the blood vessels are deeper than we think, even if you can feel the pulse of your carotids. But who knows, Avicii did it that way, but he was drunk.

I suggest you find another method tho.",,,,,,,,,,,,

What do you think the most common reason for failure is (let's not include bad anchor point, a knot that doesn't tighten)

Do you have experience from a failure?

My thoughts is that lack of determination is a very common reason, like easing into the noose and only constricting jugulars, or ""overdoing it"" going really hard into the noose so it becomes painful.

I sent the sample 2 weeks ago and also made sure it arrived its destination.
Iam sending emails to EC lab since 4 weeks and didn't get a single respond. I always get told automatically that service would be reduced to a minimum due to summer holidays, but they never mentioned that on their website or when I was ordering, this is so outragious! They are even too lazy to update the status of my order, it still says ""payment pending"", although I made sure it was paid onto their banc account. When I used a different email, I was told automatically, that the email adress no longer exists, so what kind of shit show is that?

How can a company act so extremely unprofessional? Are they even working there? Did they stop taking orders but forgot to update their website? Is my money for this bs service wasted? If they really stopped service due to holidays, then why don't they communicate like that? Did everyone left the company? Is my sample rottening there under the stairs because noone took it? I sent it in a way to make sure they have to take it personally.

So many questions... I fear I wasted a lot of money for a testkit and this terrible service. Is their an alternate service like EC? Someone already told me in private, that the guys in EC spain... are ""special"" when it comes to work, great for a lab like this, this is unbelievable!

Do you guys think that suicide should be legal as a choice?,2664627,Ffaxanadu,"Sep 9, 2024 at 6:51 PM","The problem is that assisted suicide is seen as murder; like abortion. And almost everyone doesn't want to commit ""murder"", i.e. assisted suicide.

One might object that a person could commit suicide with her/his own hands, without needing assistance from others, but society sees suicides as mentally ill people who need medical assistance. And above all, the acquaintances of those who commit suicide do NOT want to deal with suicide aftermaths.

In short, society accepts that a person's life may be miserable or painful beyond the limit of human endurance, but does not accept that a person takes her/his life because her/his life is shit.

""The road to Hell is paved with good intentions."" in this case, the pro-life intentions.

It seems logical to me but why not to most people :

1. Horrible things can happen that could put anyone in a state of unbearable pain beyond human endurance or extreme torture. : i don't know who won't agree that this is true. does anyone here? what would the normies say?

2. people would then need to be able to escape extreme torture. Yes or no? why shouldn't everyone have the right to move away from pain suffering and even more extreme pain and extreme suffering? everyone should. it's the most important right.

3. so companies and people shouldn't be restricted from selling methods that people can use to escape torture. for example companies could sell Nembutal, suicide kits, suicide booths, cyanide capsules etc . so if we lived in a free world and not prison as we do then I could purchase Nembutal for around $20 since i'm over 18. I could have nembutal and cyanide capsules in case things go really bad .
This is not the case . they made all these guaranteed suicide methods into crimes so we are prisoners.

4. they took away our right to escape extreme torture , unbearable pain, extreme suffering for no fucking reason except to control us and make us and keep us slaves an prisoners.
They made all guaranteed suicide methods into crimes . as they are about to ban SN in the evil U.S.

You do not have to download anything else, even though it is suggested to do one thing, and that is to go to Tor's settings after downloading it, to choose ""privacy and security"" and to pick the ""Safest"" security level out of the three options available.

However, bear in mind that searching and using the Deep Web is not exactly easy in a sense that you cannot find whatever you want withing seconds just like using Google search. You have to browse through hidden wikis containing various links, realize that half of them are broken, and then browse some more.

Also, even though I myself have never ordered anything from the Deep Web and am not planning to, either, I found long guides you should read before ordering anything, such as pieces of advice on how to be careful, on what to do and not to do when ordering anything, and on how to use cryptocurrency. So you will have to do a lot before engaging in anything. Some of the offers there may also be scams, some sellers may be FBI honeypots, and certain websites may have their cloned versions created by scammers just for the sole purpose of phishing and getting your password.

Then she called me on my phone instead of looking in waiting area/ shouting for me ? I missed the call and reception took a while to find her . So missed most of the appt and it was bit rushed. More confused as it was an initial triage and idk what service or her role. she got my records up but was reading as she went, didn't know my history before that. After we chatted she suggested mood management sessions with her and social prescribing referral. I agreed to see her again but declined social prescribing (basically just signposting to local services that I can find myself) . She seemed really kind and understanding though and was trying to calm me. At end of appt. I decided it'd be safe to hand her my notes, she skim read and sighed. Didn't say anything about what I wrote. Then she said she'd see me next week to discuss and offered me an appointment tuesday. So i guess i'll see what happens then. I was so stressed and rushed didn't really process it all. her reaction to the notes was hard to read and the fact she still hasn't explained anything and her role or service makes me a bit suspicious . But she didn't know much about me so idk how involved in control she could be. Also she kept my notes and I know should be confidential but worry where that info could go.

Yeah I didn't expect her to diagnose me and she isn't qualified to being a primary care practitioner anyway. She could only give her opinion on what it might be. The previous practitioner could only suggest it might be psychosis and obviously the specialists showed she got it wrong.

Me dumping that on her is not great for her in terms of risk assessment either so that might be the sigh.

I love him so much and it will be an unbelievable loss for him. Especially because he no longer lives close by and will have to uproot himself at least temporarily for the funeral and such. I hate that I'm doing that to him.

My sister will be devastated as well. I believe she will blame herself for it. Knowing her personality I think this may be an extreme take down of her mental health. It wouldn't surprise me if it destroys her life for awhile. Her mental health isn't the best to begin with and while I don't believe she's suicidal I can see it causing her to become suicidal.

,2656435,voltage268,"Sep 3, 2024 at 11:24 AM","Makes no sense but I'm actually upset at this moment that the universe put me and my younger sister together, the two of us siblings, me her older brother in my mid 30s now, a tiring life of clinical depression and generalised anxiety. She means the world to me, and I'm actually upset right now that she does, she's very easy to love, a wonderful person. If it wasn't for her, I think I could peace out out of here. Not saying it would be easy either way. My 2 parents, who I live with, and who are supporting me...my mum has been tricky since childhood as she has exasperated a lot of the mental illness strongly through religion, christianity while growing up. She's much more understanding and expressing of love nowadays on the whole but is definitely experiencing some mental health issues of her own. My dad...a good man, has not always understood my situation, but his unconditional love has always been felt. I love them both, a lot. But for some fucking reason...I have this super close relationship with my younger sister. Why couldn't I have been indifferent, a person who didn't give a fuck, or was distant, it's against my nature, which is a curse.

I often search out, read, and watch videos regarding the last notes or feelings of suicide victims/survivors, how they felt others around them would be better off without them. Why can't I get these fucking feelings. Not saying my presence is of particular value to this world, but I know my family would not think that they're better off without me. I know they love me. For my parents, as much as I love them and likewise, I could possibly do it. But my relationship with my sister is completely different, it's almost a curse at this point. What the fuck. This life has taken advantage of my caring nature, I think a lot of us here are sensitive to the (often cruel) nature of this world and are 'good' people. We both have found ourselves together in the same family, and fucked me over by giving me something precious in this shitshow world. I'm not completely cynical, there's plenty of beauty in this world, for many to enjoy, but it can be extremely cruel as well for some of us who seem to have proved to be unlucky, a mutual sentiment shared unfortunately here, despite constantly trying to overcome. I'm not a defeatist person, I'm always trying to be positive, but I get knocked down continuously by my fucking brain, and this life. Why couldn't she have been unlikeable, or indifferent to me. I am relieved and grateful she doesn't have the same condition as me, and is doing well overall.

The other major fear of not committing for what it's worth, I used to have a much greater fear of hell and eternal damnation growing up as a strong christian, as consequence for those that commit suicide - the irony of a loving god condemning you to eternal fire for being in so much pain that you felt forced to take your own life to try and escape pain, being between a rock and a hard place to put it lightly. I still have a tiny but solid faith as pretty much agnostic, but really feel all the manifestations of pain and apparent spiritual experiences, 'revelations' and realisations as limited to my brain.

Others over the years have shown admiration for the relationship my sister and I have...for me, at this point, I can't believe it's almost become a curse. Would do anything for her, but she's inadvertently keeping me in this world. How could I devastate her. And so I carry on. She's the most valuable person to me, hopefully going to marry her boyfriend soon in the next few years, and have a family. Until I can find a way to exit without suicide. When you wish for cancer or a terminal disease, as bad and debilitating, painful, hopeless, cruel as it is, you know things are fucked. I'm sorry for those here who have this. Life can be so fleeting for some who deperately want to be here, would give mine in an instant.

I really fucking wish I had no-one. Truly. Really wish the immediate people in my life hated me, or were indifferent, or even were not super close. Isn't that crazy, it's become a curse. Not super popular, don't have many close friends nowadays. Have some good cousins, aunties and uncles. Unfortunately have a very close family member. I hope she never reads this.

I'm glad I met them all and love them very much but I like you i sometimes wish I had no-one so this'd be easier or that I had cancer or something. That I could drop out of college, enjoy a few months of life as best I can, say goodbye how I want, then pass peacefully. See a certain place one time.

,2661150,releasefrompain,"Sep 7, 2024 at 3:25 AM","I feel very similarly. Let me preface this by saying that I feel horribly for people who don't have loving families. My being gay and a recovered Catholic makes me very sensitive to such awful situations that can drive someone to want to exit. It took me too long to realize it but my mom loves me more than the world and would do anything for me. And the rest of my family is very loving and caring, and I love them all. I desperately want to be able to live for all of them, especially my mom. But my condition is so incredibly painful, and uncurable, that I absolutely have to exit. If I could I would continue living just for my mom, but I can't. It kills me to think what this will do to her. Not to mention my family. (I've even made an altar to them, with all of their photos.) Honestly, I don't have many good friends. I think only my best friend will be hurt badly, but he's dealt with death of friends and family many times over. But this could really kill my mom, and that's the only thing that makes me want to go on living. She's old and in poor health. I wish I could wait until she passes, because no mother wants to lose a child this way, but my condition is progressing fast.

I'm not religious but I do believe in reincarnation. I hope that I am dead wrong and I experience nothingness after death. If I add to the list of my karmic transgressions all of the pain this will cause the ones who love me, I'm afraid I will be reincarnated over and over as a creature undergoing far more pain than I am experiencing now. I hope that my beliefs are wrong and that the universe doesn't care enough about life on earth to make us reincarnate over and over again until we have the privilege of stopping.

If the balance of karmic transgressions exists, surely it would take into account how painful it would be for you to consider this, we take no joy in having to consider this, a last resort. I hope there's nothingness as well! The idea of a god scares the shit out of me nowadays, considering how much pain they've left me to endure continuously and ignored my crying out and trying to overcome constantly my circumstances over the years.

I think a possibly hopeful thing I realised, is our reasoning about the afterlife comes from depressed and therefore more pessimistic minds that expect the worst and can't be relied upon to determine whatever truth there is. All my concepts and theorising of an afterlife come from my depressed brain. We've unfortunately become (understandably) more cynical by nature, I've seen time and again that the vast majority of fallible, ordinary human beings feel compassion for those who take their lives to escape pain, why would an apparent loving god or being not understand and be capable of that compassion as well.

I've had a failed attempt and their anguish and how badly it's affected them makes me feel terrible that I know i'm likely to try again.

First of all you are incredibly lucky you are so loved. A lot of us here would give anything to know what that feels like.

You are so ungrateful. Have you never been taught to be grateful for what you have? Do you know how many people have ABUSIVE families, wishing desperately someone gave a shit, to show love to stop them from killing themselves... and you... you're sitting there saying you WISH you didn't have people that loved you so you couldn't kill yourself? What the actual fuck is wrong with you?

Poor you. So loved. Cry me a fucking river.

Try putting yourself in others shoes. 'I wish I wasn't loved so I could kill myself'. Fuck me. What's the world coming to?! Or this site. Never thought I'd hear that. You want pity because you're fucking LOVED.

This entire post made my blood boil.

Totally wish I could trade my abusive home to a loving family, then I wouldn't be so fucked in the head, dealing with trauma my entire life and wanting to end it all the time. But.... you WISH you had a family that didn't love you? Wtf. It doesn't work like that. It doesn't make it easier to kill yourself just because no one gives a shit about you.

Learn to appreciate what you have. I've never heard someone so ungrateful for... being loved. Loved. I don't even know what that is.

I felt physically sick reading your post. 'Woe is me, so loved'. The audacity to complain that you're loved. Christ. Whatever next? Poor me I had money growing up, I wish I was poor? People are so ungrateful. It is sickening.

I honestly don't care that I'll get hate. That's fine, but if you had an ounce of empathy, I'm pretty sure you wouldn't have said you wished you wasn't loved. Come on.

Anyone trying to quote me to argue, I shall ignore. And don't try to tell me to see if from OP's perspective - there is no fucking comparison.

OP, learn to be grateful for your family. Seriously. I am still shocked reading this. You are loved. People care for you. Do something with it. Show some gratitude! I don't think you realise the impact your post has.

I am truly sorry that you don't feel loved and I deeply wish that you did, but I do want to add that love isn't a magical cure-all to suffering. For some of us it's rather painful. It doesn't mean that we're not ""grateful"" for it, but it is certainly more complex than that. Personally, I have been abused by several people whom I loved and who claimed to love me, parents included. It has made me terrified of it, yet I can't get rid off it. I can't make people unlove me and I can't unlove people. It's a living hell at times.

When it comes to CTB it creates a whole other dimension of suffering too. Everyone here is in pain, we still want out and for that to happen we have to be able to accept the fact that we'd traumatize people we love, which is something that a lot of people have a hard time with. It's actually a horrible ambivalence. Just because you can't relate to the struggles of someone doesn't make those struggles less valid.",2665079,,,,,,,,,,,
,2665690,voltage268,"Sep 10, 2024 at 5:38 PM","Thanks for the quick judgement. By stating that half of your mental issues would be eliminated based on your family, you're implying that half of your mental illness is situational, mine is 100% biological. I guess you can't understand why rich or good looking people take their own lives either, maybe they should've appreciated those things more. Maybe Robin Williams or Chester Bennington were selfish, they had pretty loving families from what they've said. Maybe count your blessings you've never experienced severe mental illness, maybe you would understand why the love of a family, money, good looks don't count for shit when you feel like you're on fire each day. Yes it is that serious for some of us. Some days are more manageable. You only read the thread title if you didn't read or discern any gratitude for my parents from my post. Maybe read a couple of the responses here who understand or are we all ungrateful too.

Have you ever inhaled charcoal smoke in the dead of the night daily for months on end to try and induce lung issues to avoid your family having to deal with the shame of suicide so that you could painfully leave this world while giving them a chance to say goodbye? Suicide doesn't give you that chance. Do you know what kind of people do that? Fucking idiots, or truly mentally desperate people whose minds are so clouded that they act irrationally. That's what years of severe mental illness can do to someone. Have you ever been to A&E multiple times being pumped with morphine because your head is on fire? I stay living for them. I'm in mental pain every fucking day. I love myself, always try and be positive and overcome and help others in my boat, sharing what I've managed to learn along the way. Maybe walk a mile in someone's shoes before making hasty judgements, especially as a user on a suicide forum. You don't know what I've done for my parents over the years, they call me the best son and it hurts. Maybe I should've been an arsehole so my death would hurt them less. See sancta-simplicitas' response below. Take your own advice.

Thanks for understanding, you hit the nail on the head. I don't think anything can shield you from mental illness developing, for sure it can be triggered by our childhood environment and be induced later on but sometimes you can have everything on the outside and be on fire on the inside. I'm sorry you've had to deal with narcissistic abuse from people who should've built you up in your formative years, hopefully you've been able to distance yourself and unravel the lies they've no doubt been telling you, and are in a better place.

I appreciate the response. Please see my above response to nembutal but said with a bit more grace lol despite the fact that I sicken you both. If you can't understand that, then I don't know what to tell you; you're lucky you can't comprehend, or believe that kind of life experience exists for some of us. I wish life was as black and white as you're implying. Don't worry, my parents know how much I love them, and help them daily. See sancta-simplicitas' response below if you're struggling.

Too many intangibles to say which person's life is 'better' or 'worse', I know you're asking rhetorically, we're obviously all hurting here and come from different sources of suffering, desperate enough to consider taking our lives. For what it's worth I'm really sorry you went through that and were dealt a shit hand. If you want any context please see above, said with a bit more grace, I got a bit of hate but I appreciate people's POVs and know we're all hurting here. Please check out sancta-simplicitas' response below, they summarised the whole thing better than me.

For those who's only possible location is in a tent I'll be writing up a post with my plan to avoid the tent melting etc etc and my reasoning for the details in my method because I know some people disagree with entering the tent at the same time as your charcoal. However I believe most ill-effects actually come from smoke and the toxic gases in smoke, if you wait until all smoking and flames have stopped, charcoal will still produce CO for hours until completely turned to ash. If there are no flames and little airflow then you know CO is being produced.

I'll be using a chimney starter like this post suggests just to be sure I have evenly burning charcoal, also be using a steel bucket and a tray of cold water to catch the downward heat. Upwards heat once the flames have stopped can be intense but it dissipates quickly. My tent is 100cm high in it's highest points so I'll probably place the bucket/tray in the centre of the tent and curl around it with some headphones in after taking some pills and drink.

I'll make another post with detailed explanation of my plan and a little diagram very soon before I go, watch out for it and if I don't respond again you'll know it was successful and the info can be archived.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,25561,weedoge,"Jul 30, 2018 at 10:13 AM","Also: @lifesucks

The preparation is difficult because, well for me it's going to basically take a full day of gathering materials. but the method itself, if pulled off correctly, is supposed to be very peaceful and even if there were nausea/headache it's still much better than the panic and pain induced by some other methods like pills with no benzos or hanging. I will be brutally honest here but the stories I hear about extreme vomiting and backing out of the method don't ring true to me, because I've made a failed attempt at this before and well.. I felt nothing at all. I only backed out because my location was bad and the method action wasn't fast enough.

Find a location where you're able to sleep with your coals, even lower concentrations will be lethal so long as you don't skimp massively on the charcoal quantity. If you're asleep then whether it takes 1 hour or 5 hours, you won't know either way.

Edit: from the 8chan thread "">>39597

Some people speculate that you bypass the nausea, dizziness, and headaches that accompany CO poisoning by sitting outside and letting it build up but with a small area like vehicle, bathroom, or tent the levels will climb fast enough that it shouldn't make a difference. It will work both ways.""",,,,,,,,,,,,

I see people say ""at least 3000mm for burning charcoal"" but I'm really curious how the permeability to water of something links to the permeability of gas, namely CO. It's all well and good saying ""at least 3000mm"" as a wild guess just because it's very waterproof but I have a feeling permeability of gas may be more complicated.

The tents I'm looking at are made from polyester with taped seams so I'm curious if this would affect the permeability. I wouldn't suggest using a tent with an outer flysheet because this is the part that is waterproof and so sealing the bottom of the fly sheet would be tough, and CO sinks in air so if the bottom of the tent isn't sealed it would likely dissipate too quickly and not fill the tent.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I had a main Facebook account (which manages groups, I don't know how long it will remain active), and two secondary accounts. I had these secondary accounts to manage my groups in case the main account had bugs, was restricted, etc.

I am a fairly isolated person, who doesn't comment as much on Facebook anymore, I moderate my groups from time to time, and I use Facebook only to communicate with my few friends or to inform myself.

My secondary accounts, which serve as redundancies (I set myself the principle of having at least one backup account, if possible, whether it be on Google, X, etc, in case there are problems with the first one).

Only Facebook (and maybe Instagram, which I rarely use, because I know how evil Facebook is, having become Meta, to escape its reputation), has suspended my two accounts and is asking me for identification documents. I don't know what to do anymore, I'm shaking with fear, cold, etc., at the idea of losing my backup accounts, a bit like losing my generator in the event of a power outage or my food reserves in the event of a disaster!

A secondary account that is not recognizable by the people who blocked me, harassed me, destroyed me, etc., was used to observe, from afar, without interacting, to see if people were dirtying me behind me for example. A precaution to protect myself from possible attacks on my dignity, I told my story of lynching that I suffered with an association.

I could CTB at any time, I'm trying to resist it. I would have liked to have a little time before CTB, because, given my health, I plan to do it, or benefit from assisted suicide or euthanasia, the time to tidy up my house, so that the few people, would not be bothered when I left, having to take care of my mess, my belongings. I wanted to have a dignified end to my life, so that I could leave properly, with dignity. But now, so anxious, on the verge of fainting, I want to CTB at any time, and leave everything as is, even if my loved ones will have to endure the mess of my belongings!

Luckily I prepared my death in advance, and paid for life insurance, my loved ones will not have this worry to have.

Facebook, Meta, Zuck killed me!",,,,,,,,,,,,

Is there any reason why giving them your ID would be bad for you in the first place ?

Couldn't you make another FB account and contact your friends from the new one, giving them a backup on different platform for instance ?

And why is this linked to your CTBing at all ? I haven't seen your other posts so sorry if you already talked about it. It's very late here and I'm not doing so well myself so my focus isn't the best, your post just made me wonder what was going on.

,2644343,disabledlife,"Aug 24, 2024 at 5:36 PM","The problem is that everyone is on Facebook, Instagram... in short, everything that belongs to Meta, Zuck, and it is practically impossible to communicate with others, study, work, play contests only available on Facebook or Instagram, etc. Even WhatsApp, belonging to Meta.

Alternatives like telegram (I have an account), are only possible if they are viable, that everyone is there. Meta, like Google (all the videos are almost only on YouTube for example), or Microsoft, Amazon, abuse their dominant position.

It's the same, despite the fact that Fiefox exists, is independent, non-profit, everyone prefers to go to Chrome, all websites, extensions, etc., are only compatible with Chrome. Firefox has very few extensions, a much smaller community. It's the same, Linux exists, but everyone is on Windows (or Apple, for the richest), because all the programs are only compatible with Windows, at the request of Microsoft, who did everything so that schoolchildren learn computers on Windows! It's the same with smartphones, everyone is on Android (Google), or Apple. No alternative operating systems, Firefox OS has not penetrated the market, no one is interested in it.

We talk about democracy, but, in reality, it's false, everything is managed by multinationals, a large multinational by market share (arms, Big Pharma, GAFAM, tech, Keolis, Suez, Veolia, Carrefour, Wall Mart, etc.). The media and television too, although more and more people follow alternative media, including on Telegram.

In the past, Athenian democracy had invented the principle of ostracism, to prevent any person, company, too influential, from dominating democracy, by excluding it from society.

I am really surprised that no one tries to pursue multinationals to dismantle them. While the problem is clearly visible. We are heading towards a world like Orwell's 1984, associated with idiocracy. Black Mirror also becomes reality. All these fears make me want to CTB, and never come back alive.

You might be surprised by how many applications Linux supports now. I've never found one lacking for my use case, including gaming. I guess an exception might be if you need to use some Adobe software.

You might be interested in the fediverse (lemmy, Mastodon, etc.) Obviously it doesn't have near the reach of Meta, but I feel like the communities are far more pleasant, if you're on an instance that's a good fit for you, and they've been a lot more active since the reddit migration of June 2023.

,2644965,Marine,"Aug 25, 2024 at 9:02 AM","More and more alternatives are developing and many people have favored places like Telegram. It's a number effort. Plus it's still possible to post only links in your FB account and redirect somewhere safe.

I think at this point only morons not worth your time use Chrome (which I never used and can't understand why anybody would honestly, as far as I know Firefox has always better far better and now very good browsers like Brave exist too) and remain confined to Meta. While I still use some of their platforms for what it still does for me, I use alternative platforms for anything serious, such as Telegram, and post redirecting links on FB, which works fine, people find them and are open to using alternatives which are growing as a result. I wouldn't just assume that people would be unwilling to discover new ways in the old degrade and it doesn't have to be a radical cut either. If you want to stick to something mainstream knowing that it might be taken down so including backups maybe Discord is a better alternative to FB ?

The problem with a lot of open source software is that it's not good enough yet for most people to use them as their main choice. That isn't the case of alternative platforms like Telegram, Odyssee etc.

I know that democracy is a scam, just like the myth of authority and government to begin with.

This is a reading guide to the guides I published on this forum so far. I will arrange the guides in the order you should read them. I highly recommend you read them all.

With this, I guarantee you will find out whether or not hanging is right for you and, if it is a good fit, you'll have all the knowledge you need to hang yourself like an expert.

Unfortunately I can't edit the original post, so in case of future updates check the replies below.

With all that out the way, let's begin!


1) Learn about a simple experiment you can do to know what a successful partial suspension hanging feels like:
Why everyone fails at partial hanging
Hi everyone, I know there's plenty of people here that tried partial suspension hanging and didn't get the desired results. Well, everyone fails because they forget to hold their breath. This is actually very important because if you don't do that, you will just start hyperventilating in an...
sanctioned-suicide.net

2) Learn from how others have managed to kill themselves with partial suspension hanging:
Collection of videos of successful partial suspension hanging attempts
I believe that people that come to the conclusion of hanging themselves full suspension have a phase in which they are into partial suspension, desperately trying to get it to work. So I decided to create a collection of successful partial suspension hanging attempts in video format, for...
sanctioned-suicide.net

Editor's note: At the moment of writing, I didn't publish any written guide on partial suspension hanging specifically, since for the vast majority of people it just won't work. But it follows a lot of the same principles of full suspension hanging, so you can read the guides below to get an idea on how partial suspension hanging should be done. Particularly, look at step 6 of this guide.

3) Once the frustration from partial suspension hanging sets in, learn about how it feels to kill yourself with full suspension hanging:
Collection of testimonials on what it feels like to hang yourself
I decided to create a collection of testimonials from people who went through the hanging experience. I'll try to include testimonials from those who lost consciousness, but if I find a testimonial particularly useful (even though they didn't lose consciousness) I'll include it. I'm generally...

4) Learn all the basics of full suspension hanging:
Essential guide to hanging (aka making full suspension hanging accessible to everyone)
Who are you? Why should I listen to you? Can I trust you? I am a suicidal woman that has been studying about hanging for more than five years. I have attempted suicide by hanging a few times in the past, and I plan on dying by full suspension hanging. I have studied about hanging from various...
sanctioned-suicide.net

5) Learn about suitable anchor points for full suspension hanging available to anyone:
PSA Guide on how to find an anchor point for full suspension hanging
Are you interested in full suspension hanging but have nowhere to hang yourself from at home? Or perhaps you don't have the privacy at home to hang yourself? Or perhaps you don't want to be found by your relatives or friends? Or perhaps you don't want your corpse to soil and rot in your house...
sanctioned-suicide.net

6) Learn about common mistakes in hanging and how to avoid them (valid also for partial suspension hanging):
Guide on how to lose consciousness when hanging yourself (aka most common hanging mistakes)
I've seen a lot of doubt regarding whether or not someone is conscious or unconscious during a full suspension hanging attempt. Below I've linked some videos in which people are undoubtedly conscious for a few minutes (due to them not following the hanging best practices)...
sanctioned-suicide.net

7) Learn some important information on hanging:
Collection of useful tips, tricks and notes on hanging
If you need a rope and can't buy it in store or get it delivered to your house because of your parents finding out about it (as an example), you can make use of Click & Collect on eBay (and Amazon too, I think) to get it delivered somewhere else for you to pick up later. It's a free service...

I just tried this right now and I'll try to describe it as best as I can. So, I tied a noose knot on a bathrobe belt, put it around my neck and then I slowly pulled it upwards using my hands. I made sure to relax the muscles of the neck to avoid pinching them (I just mentally release all tension from the neck muscles). Next, I just pulled hard upwards until I could feel the upper part of my airway blocking my ability to breathe (if you imagine the airway like a tube, imagine it being compressed on the upper part). I tried to go a few seconds like that and I could hear echoes and I could feel it working, but I just couldn't handle being out of breath... I mean, out of breath and uncapable of breathing. It's very very similar to the experiment I posted about some time ago, where you pull the rope upwards while pinching your nose.

I imagine that's how partial suspension hanging works, since in the videos I posted a lot of them have agonal breathing. The only reason I can't go through with it is because it's not as reliable as full suspension hanging. But yeah, it's more uncomfortable than painful.",2636737,,,,,,,,,,,

It's a common method and i think how famous people have done it (chris cornell, chester bennington, robin williams, michael hutchence, david foster wallace, sulli, kate spade...) and they got through the SI somehow, sometimes with prescription meds/benzos and alcohol in their systems.

I never attempted to hang myself with alcohol or benzos in my system, so I can't comment on whether or not they could help with survival instinct. But I heard some people say that alcohol makes your SI worse.

I tend to advise staying sober before hanging yourself to avoid making mistakes.

By the way, there's a video on YouTube about some girl managing to hang herself in her closet after taking some klonopin, so I'm assuming klonopin helps with SI? Or maybe klonopin had no effect on the fact that she succeeded at hanging herself with partial suspension? Who knows.

1) I'm not meant for existing
This is the way I've always felt, I'm not meant for something as cruel, futile and torturous as having the ability to exist, human existence has always been such a burden to me, it's a terrible and harmful burden that causes nothing but me pain. It's always been a struggle existing as a conscious being destined to suffer endlessly with no limit as to how much agony I can feel, it's just not for me, I never should have existed at all and more than anything I wish I never did.

Only the peace that non-existence can bring appeals to me, I wish to die but only never existing is true perfection, it'd be such a relief for me to die as this existence I was never meant for just torments me and I find it so hellish how painless suicide methods aren't accessible for me. if I could die painlessly I'd be long gone from this existence I was never meant for, only death can bring me peace. In my case I wouldn't want to exist under any circumstance as what I have a problem with is existence itself, I'm just not meant for it and I find it tragic how I have to exist when instead I could be at peace for all eternity, my existence is just meaningless suffering all for no reason and no purpose, I'm not meant to suffer, I'm only meant for the peace of eternal nothingness.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Why does life have to exist when nobody can be harmed by the peace of eternal nothingness, I find it so tragic to exist as a conscious being destined to suffer, deteriorate and decay with no limit as to how bad the agony can get, it really is all just meaningless suffering and I don't want to suffer in any way, rather I just wish for the eternity of non-existence, I wish all could be erased and forgotten about for me.

To die is always preferable to me than suffering in this cruel, pointless existence where chance so senselessly determines everything, I find it so tragic how existing beings have to suffer as a result of this abomination, I wish I could just fall into an eternal, dreamless sleep preventing all future pointless torment in an existence that caused me nothing but pain, it's tragic how existing beings are tortured every second, so many of them dying slowly and painfully.

It's all bad and evil. All good and bad things part of the same evil . I can't separate the good from the bad or extreme torture that are both part of life and this evil world.

So nothing forever is not anything bad but very good because it's the opposite of what life is.

I think after Death is non-existence forever. To me that is the best thing by a trillion times

There is no need for existence of any kind

Nothing matters. What will matter in 200 years? In a trillion years? Nothing

Nothing matters except avoiding extreme pain extreme suffering

,2662136,CHOSEVIOLENCE,"Sep 10, 2024 at 12:30 AM","Hello goobers! If you are reading this then it most likely means that I am no longer among the living. So what does that mean? Cliché goodbyes.

I've never been the sentimental sort, but I still wanted to say that I'm glad to have met and spoken with many of the people that I did here. You all have made me laugh, made me annoyed, and made me question my sanity, and yes, all three of those are meant in a positive way. I've had many mixed feelings about this forum, but the one thing that remained consistent was my pleasant experiences with many of you here. I got to be a bit of a sardonic jerk, and I enjoyed being one, so thank you all for tolerating that despite it all.

I also wanted to apologise to anyone I've hurt here. I've not also been the most helpful or understanding despite trying to. I've navigated most of my life with little comprehension of others and even less desire to understand what makes people tick. It's only lately that I've been learning empathy and how to form lasting relationships, and it's a basic form that needs a lot more work. I'm also a very moralistic person who has formed values, and people with my condition stick very closely to their values, so when someone does something I find objectionable, I feel the need to call it out, or I'll just be letting it happen. I could do the latter, of course, but then I'd feel like I'm suppressing myself to ""keep the peace"" instead of laying out who I am. Still, I've yapped a lot on here, maybe even too much, so I'm sorry for saying things that hurt others or made them uncomfortable. You have earned the right to call me a bunch of expletives; I won't even complain.

Another thank you to people who have been checking up on me or worried about me. I didn't realise people felt connected to me like that, especially when I've never seen myself as someone worth having more than a shallow relationship with, so it's sobering. I want you all to know that you have been a large part of the reason why I've kept going as long as I have. Getting to talk to you has been a highlight of each day. Some are you are so rediculous it's a wonder why you haven't tried for a career in stand-up.

That being said... Don't feel sad for me; instead, tell a joke for me, make an inappropriately timed pun, have a laugh. The world is already so serious, don't feel the need to add to that at my expense. I promise I won't haunt you if you do! Thank you all once more. I believe God has a plan for all of us and that we'll meet again under better circumstances. Enchanté everyone.

Guide on how to create an anchor point for full suspension hanging using only a dumbbell,2642679,Evelyn Lane,"Aug 23, 2024 at 6:03 AM","Do you want to hang yourself using full suspension in the comfort of your home or in a hotel, but have no anchor points? Well, here's the solution for you. It's very simple yet effective, requiring only a dumbbell.

For this setup you'll be using a rope, and slip one end over a door, tying it to a small 2kg dumbbell using a snuggle hitch (this would keep the rope in place).
Then on the other side of the door you'll make a noose right at the top of the door.
The idea is that you'll close the door, use a chair to get your head through the noose and drop off.

You could also use door stoppers to make the setup even more reliable. However, if you use the external part of the door, you won't need any door stoppers.

This method is better than tying a rope to a doorknob, since doorknobs can break. This method is suitable for anyone, no matter the weight.

Just to add a little idea: a ratchet strap like on the photo could also be used to pass through the locked closed door and be blocked by the metal side (playing the role of the dumbbell). If the rope is too thick.

I think using an exercise door anchor might be better than building an anchor with weights yourself, I mean these things are pre-made to handle a lot of weight and in my weight tests it did do a good job, no guarantees of course. that being said the door I am using is taller than your average door, the loop of the anchor is too long for using it wit.,h a rope on normal sized doors, still worry about dangling against the door though, idk swinging freely would be better.

Anyways, one really doesn't need a dumbbell or any other tool for this, you could just tie a big lump at the other side of the rope.

The thing that would worry me doing this method full suspension is that the door wouldn't be able to handle it, so i believe it's a better option for partial hanging, like most celebrities have done it in recent years (Bennington, Cornelius, Williams, Bourdain etc).",,,,,,,,,,,,

I will do it at night on a workday and also use a ratchet tensioner with a strong band securing the door from the inside (has a 1000 kg breaking point).

I tried attaching it to the door handle and there's no way anyway gets in with that, i couldn't even pull the handle down with force, and the band is also pulling the door inwards with extreme force. I've also filed down the screws to the door handle on the outside so they can't remove it. Heck, i believe the only way they will be able to get in is through welding a hole in the door, since one has to have it open to be able to lift it off. Anyways, the chances of being found should be next to none, and then there's how long they would have to work on getting the door open.

I just hope that snorting a proper dose of heroin and let it reach peak plasna levels (~5 min) before i take the step off will take away most of the pain, or even better, make me lose consciousness, then i won't have to endure the time it takes from the rope inducing it, if it does. With the lack of luck i've had in my life so far it wouldn't surprise me if it didn't happen, even if the knot is right in the middle if the neck as high up as possible.

I really don't get why people that live in the US chose any other way than taking a huge fentanyl overdose or put a shotgun in their mouth aimed at the brainstem, seeing how easy it is to get both over there. Both painless and a 100% success rate if you don't have any opioid tolerance, especially if mixed with benzos (unless you're found).",,,,,,,,,,,,

Since then we've gone through a bunch of other meds off label (there's no specific one for this) and none have worked, so i've really lost all hope, will to fight gotten my affairs in order etc.

It sure sucks, because i really want nothing else than to live, but dying is better than living with this. It's like i'm stuck in a window in a burning high rise, and either i jump to my death and end the suffering, or i remain in the window, constantly feeling the pain of the flames.

It's completely ruined my life and ability to function in daily life, and because of the visual, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms it's causing i can't enjoy anything.

The days after it hurt to swallow as well.

So if one is unlucky and don't lose consciousness when actually going through with this, it's one hell of a brutal way to go; hanging there suffocating in extreme pain for minutes until you eventually pass out, and i bet those minutes feels like years and are filled with panic on top of it because of the survival instinct. If i'm not mistaken they stopped executing prisoners with suspension hanging in many countries back in the day because of how ""inhumane"" and slow it was, and switched to the drop hang with a hangman's nose.

So it really is beyond me why anyone that has thought about it for a longer period of time and don't do it on impulse and that lives in a country were a firearm or fentanyl is easy to get a hold of choses hanging (like in the US), because if you don't have any opioid tolerance it doesn't require snorting many mg of Fentanyl mixed with a potent benzo to feel euphoria, nod off and quite quickly go in to respiratory depression. It doesn't get much more painless and peaceful than that, and you can't go wrong with a bigger caliber bullet or a shotgun aimed at the brainstem either, it's an instant death, you won't even have time to react.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Why I’m homicidal at my teacher and my CTB plan,2665499,Webnext,"Sep 10, 2024 at 1:32 PM","Note that this is a long thread and this might get someone shocked but I've been holding this for too long to myself and I'm letting out my anger and need to put this out for help so please read this so you know my problem that I'm struggling with.

Ok so at the beginning of my senior year in high school in August 2021, I had a math female teacher who was around her 30's for my mathematics class that me and my classmates were getting along with. On the first day with every teacher that I know who does this, puts up a presentation welcoming the class and getting to know the teacher like where they were from and what hobbies they like and their family etc. She told us that she was from brazil and how she was a teacher in Panama and is married with a husband, and also had a little boy and she also had another baby coming so she was pregnant when we saw her and was only at the school for a semester. It was her second year teaching at the district where my school I was in as she taught math back then in Panama for a long time so she wasn't a new teacher to begin with. On the first week everything went smooth since it was the beginning and getting used to the class. As the school year progresses starting the second or third week, we were learning the math material which I definitely liked how she taught math to us and that wasn't an issue.

However, she setup a system for the class on letting us use the restroom whenever we need to. I know none of my other teachers did this so I know it wasn't a school policy that everyone had to follow and it was only her system that she made. Every quarter, we were giving out four bathroom passes that she made and the passes would have her name and name of the class written on the pass so it wasn't school made by the way so during class with her and when a student had to use the restroom didn't had anymore passes, she would still let the student go but she would take away employability points in the gradebook which everytime I witness that made me felt like that is unethical and not right at all. Going to the bathroom is something that we can't control, it's not like my classmates are leaving the class intentionally to do something else like using their phone. Heck we had to turn our phones in so we couldn't use them during class which that's understandable since students get distracted on their phone and don't pay attention so I'm not mad about that part. But what makes me more crazy is one time I needed to use the restroom so when I left the classroom to use it and when it says it was out of order, I would come back and tell her and she would be like ok and then I ask her if I can get my pass back and she does this weird way of saying no that she likes to do this fake smile quietly in front of me and won't say anything and that's her fault of saying no to me and it really pisses me off when it's not my fault the school restroom was out of order and didn't get my pass back.

Her system was very strict and myself as a student, I also had learning disabilities so I was part of the IEP plan which allows me to have extended time whenever we take a test or a quiz. I remember when I was taking a math test and when the class is over and if I told her that I was still working on it and it's part of my IEP plan, she does her fake smile again but she did went back and let me finish it but I could tell she didn't like that but it's a requirement from the school. Everytime I think about her fake smile was wanting me to get more angry at her deep down inside of me.

So right now I'm in college so there's years has come by since I last saw her and ever since then I cannot let go of how mad I am at her for her stupid strict system that she made that I wanted to get revenge. I did found her online like her Facebook profile and what house she lives and her address online and I am worried that I'm going to do something bad and was thinking about arson (burning her house down one night), but I'm not a murderer or haven't done any crime in my entire life but my brain is controlling me and I can't control myself and I if I did act on property damage to her house that I would CTB right away since I'm scared of the police or being arrested since it's my worst nightmare and it's nothing like me to be arrested since I never committed any crimes in my life. My evil brain is telling me what to do and it's been giving me pain in my chest that it's preventing me from studying in college and focusing on other things in life.

Once again, I am sorry for those who are stunned on reading this but I have to be tell the truth on what I'm thinking about and thinking while angry is not a crime but also just wish that a teacher who is also a parent outside of her teaching life should've been more open-minded and had more freedom to ourselves and instead was making me and my classmates feel miserable throughout the semester that I had with her! She never laughed or was happy with me everyday I saw her even though I tried to entertain her but it was never fun with her as my math teacher.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Guide to partially suspended hanging:

Warning: Don't try this method unless you're totally sure that:
a) you want to kill yourself
b) that you won't be found for at least 30 minutes after you attempt.

This method is very lethal and quick (quick from your perspective
anyway, as you black out within seconds), but if you're found in time
and 'saved' you can end up with serious brain damage and/or be left a
vegetable.

Why partial suspension?
Because full suspension seems to me to be unnecessary and creates
difficulties. First of all you need to find a place which would hold
your entire weight, which isn't easy, and also you need a stronger
ligature, which isn't always easy to find either. There's nothing
wrong with full suspension, but it may not be a viable method for
everyone, especially if you're looking to use everyday materials from
around the home.

By partial suspension I mean that you hang yourself around the neck
(specifically the carotid artery), and push downwards while kneeling.
This should create enough downward pressure on the ligature to tighten
it and close the carotid artery and stop the blood flow to your brain.
All you need is 3 kilograms of pressure to do this, which isn't much
at all.

Also, with full suspension your entire body weight is pressurizing
your neck, and this would probably be more than enough to not only cut
off the blood supply to your brain, but break your neck as well. I'm
not too sure if that's a good or a bad thing. I do know though, that
statistically people who've attempted via hanging have more often been
found kneeling and partially suspended than being fully suspended.

Where is the carotid artery?
Before you start you have to know this. If you place your hand around
the middle of your neck, around your Adam's apple, with one thumb on
one side and all fingers on the other, you should feel a strong pulse
and heartbeat. If you close your hand now fairly firmly, you'll
probably make yourself pass out. It might be a good idea to try this
to make sure you've got the right spot.

What type of ligature?
You need a ligature that's strong, but not too elastic. It doesn't
have to be very long, 1 meter or more would be plenty. I'd advise
against nylon rope, string, fishing wire, etc.
Neckties on the other hand, are perfect Smile .

It may also be a good idea to lubricate the ligature with soap. This
would help the noose tighten even quicker, especially if you're using
a rough ligature such as a rope. Lubricating it in this way will
increase the friction once you push your head down and tighten the
noose, and could make it a little more effective and faster.

What type of knot?
A slipknot. It's one of the most basic knots around, and you make it
with one end of your ligature. The other end should go around your
hanging place.

Many people have the misguided idea that a hangman's knot should be
used, but they're wrong. A hangman's knot is for a completely
different purpose, and won't work for this method.

Where should I hang?
You should hang from a support which will hold part of your weight.

You should test this by tying the loose end of your ligature around
the support several times, sticking your hand (NOT your head) in the
noose and pushing down with it. If the noose holds, you're fine. If
not, then you'll have to find another spot.

A great and easy place to hang is from the thick horizontal metal bar
which you find in wardrobes in most homes.

When should I do it?
When no one else will be in the same area, for at least 30 minutes.
You lose consciousness within seconds but your body doesn't completely
die for around 15-20 minutes. The extra 10-15 minutes is for
preparation time and just in case.

How?

When you're completely ready, kneel down, stick your head in the
noose, position it around the carotid artery and push downwards with
your head.

Good luck...",,,,,,,,,,,,

Asphyxiation by pushing the tongue upwards or constricting the trachea to block the airways are equally as important as blocking the carotid arteries and jugular vein. This is especially true in hangings with short or no drop. What gets constricted depends on the force of pressure.

the only upsides to the method is it is supposed to be relatively quick from your perspective, and is easily accessible for many people. but like you, i had to look at other methods after being unable to bring myself to pull off full suspension. i felt the despair of wishing to die but being unable. but fortunately, i ended up switching to SN after finally finding a source.",2665307,,,,,,,,,,,

Full suspension not working for me.,2665400,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 10, 2024 at 12:09 PM","SI is a real bitch. I think the body knows with hanging that it's a danger. plus, hanging involves a body envelope violation, which is something we want to avoid instinctually. I think that's why ODs and the like (SN, N, fent, etc) are much easier, since you're just drinking or swallowing something as opposed to physically harming your body. And yeah with full hanging, you definitely want nothing around you that you can reach once you fully suspend, cause your brain on autopilot is gonna be looking for a way out of danger.

I would advise against the CO2 method, though. If you know anything about how oxygen breathing animals work, you'll know that we have a well functioning system in our bodies for detecting CO2. If you hold your breath it will get uncomfortable, and then unbearable and you'll take a breath no matter what (even under water, letting water into your lungs). One of the most unethical ways we slaughter animals is gassing them with CO2, as they literally go insane and suffer immensely before death. So please do not do that to yourself, if you can avoid it. You'd likely have a better time fully hanging than this method.

I'm sorry you're going through this. I had many attempts where I was damn sure that it'd be my last day on Earth, but yet I'm still here. I wish you luck with whatever you end up doing.",2665349,,,,,,,,,,,

If you don't mind, I have some questions for you:

1) What sort of rope/ligature did you use? What was the diameter of it?

2) Did you put your entire body weight on the noose (as in, you were fully suspended) or just part of it?

3) How long did you manage to stay on the noose, in seconds?

4) In your own words, how bad would you describe the pain to be? In which part(s) of your body did you feel pain? And could you give it a rating from 1 to 10 in terms of how painful it was (1 being least painful thing you ever experienced and 10 being most painful thing you ever experienced)?

2. I was planning on using my full body weight but the SI was too strong and it forced me to stand.
3. Maybe 2 seconds suspended.
4. Honestly I would rate it a 10, the pain was on my neck. It felt like burning pain even with a cloth between my neck and the rope. I was not expecting so much pain and believe that is what made me unsuccessful.

Would you say the pain was limited to the skin of your neck, or did you feel pain inside the neck too (for example, in the muscles of your neck, bones, etc.)?

In case the pain is exclusively on the skin of the neck, do you think something like baby oil could help? (Or am I misunderstanding the nature of the pain you're describing? In which case feel free to correct me.)

As for the SN, it's illegal for ANYONE except you to open a parcel addressed to you without due process (e.g. probably cause or a search warrant, which they won't have :) 4th amendment ftw!)

Just make sure you use your real name, make an account on USPS, and use their ""intercept a package"" thing to request that it be held for you. I think I'm understanding that correctly, I've never done it myself like this.

Very hard working people have been working for hundreds of years building on top of previous research and evidence to find out what life is , where did it come from, what is a human etc .

All this is known. All a person has to do is read some books about the brain, evolution, cell biology . The more you read and think the more obvious it seems that all the things in those books is true. Each neuron is exactly the same in all species

There is really no difference between a fly a mouse and a human. . for example all have brains composed of nerve cells called neurons or Brain cells.

Does a fly a cell have a soul or afterlife or reincarnation? No . Neither does a human ape.

Alternative to SWB Using a Plastic Bag,2664875,Hysteria,"Sep 9, 2024 at 10:56 PM","Hello everyone,

Why do people opt for water when a plastic bag could be just as adequate? By securing a bag over my head with layers of tape or ratchet straps, I believe the process would mirror the effect of drowning - leading to hyperventilation, a peaceful unconsciousness, and eventual passing from asphyxiation.

This method offers advantages over SWB: no need to deal with water, cold, or the risk of being seen, and it's more accessible. However, I'm concerned about potential air leaks, like the small holes in bags that aren't noticeable when carrying groceries but could interfere with an attempt.

What are your thoughts? Why is SWB more popular when plastic bags are readily available?

Hysteria",,,,,,,,,,,,
Alternative to SWB Using a Plastic Bag,2665417,Intoxicated,"Sep 10, 2024 at 12:23 PM","Considering how difficult it is to achieve SWB in a usual way in general, you most likely won't accomplish it in a single attempt. You may need 10-20 iterations of hyperventilation followed by breath-holding until the urge to breathe becomes unbearable each time, and eventually you may develop a sufficient tolerance to CO2 that would let you pass out. Such a training is easy when you can submerge your head and resume breathing quickly, but you can't do it so easily when you have to seal and unseal a bag.

Additionally, a bag would contain some residual air that may cause issues with maintaining unconsciousness. If you displace all air from the bag using an asphyxiant gas, this could be a good alternative to SWB, but it's a matter of preference after all. SWB with a help of an inert gas may be a good method on its own too.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Alternative to SWB Using a Plastic Bag,2665566,willitpass,"Sep 10, 2024 at 2:42 PM",The plastic bag method is notorious for people taking it off their head while unconscious. I plan on putting a very large trash bag over my head once nearing unconsciousness from a massive overdose but even then I am aware it's a possibility I still manage to take it off. Especially if attempting to do this completely sober you will just remove the bag. If you tape the bag so it can't just be taken off you'll likely find you clawed it off. I believe almost all cases in which a plastic bag was successful at all are related to comorbid drug and alcohol ingestion. Once your brain registers you are running out of oxygen it will do what it has to do to save you.,,,,,,,,,,,,
The story of my foolishness with SN,2665562,retVarii,"Sep 10, 2024 at 2:37 PM","Here is a story about how I foolishly lost, sought and ultimately regained my access to SN.

Three countries are relevant here: country A, where I live, country B, where my family considers moving and where my sister studies, and Spain, where I usually go for summer vacation. (My family's intention was to move to country B after the vacation to continue my education as well.) Getting sodium nitrite in country A was very easy: local marketplaces sell it relatively freely. So I got my SN and a testing kit in the middle of April 2024.

Now this is where my stupidity kicks in: I decided that I should CTB not in country A, but in Spain during my vacation. You see, for many years, our apartment in Spain is the only thing that reassured me. It was the place that gave me some semblance of living, even if I had to be stuck with my mother. (We sometimes went there with some friends though.) I even used to see that place in my dreams. But two years prior we sold it and bought a new apartment. (A decision I terribly, TERRIBLY regret allowing, I'm now heartbroken...) And I thought that maybe if we had a chance to visit our old flat, I could do the deed there, as my last visit...

Because of all this, I kept my SN in my room since April. I thought I would simply bring it with me, but I never actually thought it through.

In the process, two problems completely demolished this plan. Firstly, I was too scared to bring SN on an airplane after all (curse my procrastination addiction…), so I left it home, hoping I would get a new package in Spain. Little did my careless self know, it would be a lot harder. Maybe I could simply ask for a source on this site, but I just didn't bother to ask until the end of the vacation, when it was too late. Secondly, we never visited the old flat. I have no clue what I was hoping for...

In the end, I didn't find a source there, and I had to leave for country B, totally SN-less. I found a source that I would check if we moved to country B permanently, but then the irony kicked in. For private purposes, we couldn't continue education in country B, and so my mother and I went back to country A. And just like that, I reunited with my SN. Not in my sentimental vacation flat, but back home. I know all of this sounds rather silly, but really, my whole life is like this. Procrastination – failure – rumination – sorta success with a stretch. I guess I just have to accept that I won't have reassuring last moments that I wished for – no, I will have to die in this house, in the ill-fated country A, in an environment that brings me despair and suffering.

My mother says that under certain circumstances we might buy a new apartment in the same building in the future, but at this point my patience is over. I simply can't take being given false hopes anymore. I have now decided to bury my dreams to CTB in Spain & take the first opportunity to CTB right here. In that case, I'll have to wait until my mother moves to country B for whatever reason. I am too scared to do anything suspicious in her presence. I just hope that sodium nitrite can be stored for longer than 5 months.

I'm exhausted.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It's a free service. It's worth looking into this if you have such an issue.

I recommend you wear a mouthguard to avoid biting your tongue.

---

Hyperventilate before hanging yourself so that you can hold your breath for longer. I also recommend you fully exhale and fully inhale before you hold your breath.

---

Pre-tighten the noose knot after wearing the noose on your neck. Fully tighten it and make sure it is located perfectly on the back of your neck.

---

Drop your weight all at once instead of little by little. However, don't ""jump"" from the chair. Do it gently, but at the same time, drop all your weight at once. Step off the chair instead of kicking it.

---

Stretch and relax your neck muscles before hanging yourself.

---

Relax.

---

Remember, death is always either painful or uncomfortable no matter how you die, but people have endured hangings before to the point of unconsciousness (see BDSM couples and suicidal hanging survivors) without any lasting effect on their body (since hanging yourself is not physically traumatic unlike shooting yourself, stabbing yourself, jumping, drinking poison or overdosing). And, regardless, unconsciousness sets in quickly.

The carotid arteries are nature's power off button to humans. It's a more natural and peaceful way of killing yourself compared to many other methods (it's not by chance that it has been the most popular and most reliable suicide method everywhere throughout all of history).

For example, this woman felt no hesitation in enduring hanging herself to the point of unconsciousness (NSFW): https://www.livegore.com/422543/chasing-orgasmic-bliss-almost-there-2

---

If you're hanging yourself outside, take a long nap beforehand, so that you don't feel lack of energy at night. Also, eat light, so that you don't feel sluggish.

---

If you're hanging yourself outside, remember to turn off your phone or turn on airplane mode to avoid the phone ringing and attracting attention.

---

The journey at night towards your hanging spot should feel like an adventurous journey to another reality. Many people before us have taken this nightly journey towards a hanging spot. Put your favourite music on. Whether or not you accept this, nobody knows if and what is there after death. Is it the end... or a brand new beginning?",,,,,,,,,,,,

Exit bag and inert gas megathread,142573,TiredHorse,"Nov 28, 2018 at 11:20 PM","Exit Bag and Inert Gas Basics —A very, very long post, I know, but I feel like I've fielded a lot of questions about this, so I figured I'd spell out everything I know. Others on the forum should please add to this thread whatever reliable technical information they feel is appropriate for someone attempting this method to have.

The idea behind using an exit bag with inert gas is to create an atmosphere around your head that is both free of life-sustaining O2 and can carry away the exhaled CO2 that would activate your hypercapnic alarm.

The Gas:

You will need to keep the inert gas flowing at 15 liters per minute (Lpm) for 40 minutes to be confident of ending your life —in other words, you'll need a minimum of 600 liters of inert gas. In the past this would have been helium (He), but due to the uncertain availability of genuinely pure He, the best current options are nitrogen (N2) and argon (Ar). Both are reliably available in pure form (no air contamination) from stores that supply welders. N2 is also available from some brewery supply houses, but the purity of the gas should be confirmed to your satisfaction. Both N2 and Ar should work to ctb and are similar enough in their properties to be treated identically for use with an exit bag.

Pressurized gas cylinder sizes are not standardized across the industry, nor internationally, and it can be difficult, if not impossible, to tell how much gas they contain from a photograph on a website.

In the US, a 20 cubic foot (cf) cylinder is the smallest you should use for ctb; a 40cf will allow some margin for flinching, practicing, etc. ""A 20cf"" and ""a 40cf"", or ""a 20"" and ""a 40"" is nomenclature US welding supply houses will recognize, so asking for either should get you the desired product. A 20cf cylinder is quite small for industrial use; I've had clerks tell me, ""well, we have a 40, but we'll need to special order a 20."" It's up to you what you do in that situation. Personally, I have a 40cf cylinder. It has allowed me to flinch and abort my attempt three times now, and I don't need to worry about refilling it. I bought my N2 at AirGas, a national company here in the US. They do not demand any sort of professional certification for purchasing inert gas, and no more than the usual forms of ID depending on payment method.

I know nothing of gas cylinders outside the US, so if you are using other than US-typical cylinders, you'll need to call and ask to make sure whatever tank you're contemplating holds 600L of compressed gas. Hopefully knowledgeable forum members will add cylinder sizing information to this knowledge base.

Cover story: N2 and Ar are both used for welding. N2 is used in beer brewing. In my day job, I use both N2 and Ar to flood partial cans of expensive paint, to displace the O2 in the cans and prevent the paint from skinning over and going bad. It's a cost saving measure. The clerks I've bought gas from have never heard of that trick, which has meant they don't know enough to interrogate me on my motives or to try and quiz me on my welding knowledge. They have merely said, ""huh! That's a new one!""

The store clerk may ask how you're carrying the pressurized cylinder ""back to your shop,"" since pressurized cylinders can be very hazardous to transport (the valve is vulnerable to damage in an accident). I haven't had any trouble when I have told the clerk, ""in the back footwell of my car, and very carefully padded!"" What they really want to know is that you are aware that a pressurized cylinder is a missile waiting to explode if anything damages it, and that you know enough to not let that happen.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Exit bag and inert gas megathread,142575,TiredHorse,"Nov 28, 2018 at 11:20 PM","The Regulator:

A regulator screws on to the cylinder and does two things: 1) it reduces the pressure in the cylinder to a useable level, otherwise the 2000psi tank pressure would just blow the exit bag off your head as soon as you opened the valve, and 2) it controls the rate of gas flow into the exit bag —specifically, it should release it at 15Lpm, which is the minimum adequate to carry away exhaled CO2 and fool your lungs into believing there's enough air.

The good news is that while gas cylinder sizes are not globally standardized, the cylinder valve threads are —and both N2 and Ar cylinders have the same threads (other gasses have different threads), so a regulator that fits on one cylinder will fit equally well on another.

You don't need to worry about being sure to choose a regulator that will reduce the pressure: they all do that. The flowmeter is the critical element of the regulator for our purposes.

Some regulators come with a ""click adjust"" flowmeter that is very simple, allowing you to dial in 15Lpm without needing to think about it. To the best of my knowledge, these are medical grade regulators; generally very good quality, but often a bit more expensive. Others here may know more about them, and where to acquire them, than I do.

A typical welding regulator will have two gauges: the tank pressure gauge (unimportant to us) and the flowmeter gauge.

A welding regulator's flowmeter gauge will be marked in either cubic feet per hour (Cfh), Lpm, or both. Some welding systems require a fairly low flow of inert gas, much lower than our necessary 15Lpm, and this low flow is most easily measured in Cfh. If you see a gauge marked only in Cfh, it probably will not work for our purpose. Look at the highest Cfh setting on the flowmeter and do the math, to be certain. If the gauge reads in Lpm, a glance should tell you whether the regulator provides the necessary 15Lpm flow.

Harbor Freight Tools offers a cheap CO2/Ar regulator (it also works for N2) with a flowmeter that shows flow in both Cfh and Lpm and goes high enough for our purposes. This is what I have.

The Hose:

The hose needs to be long enough to reach from the gas cylinder beside you, up into the exit bag on your head. I have found it easiest to lead the hose up my back and into the bag at the very back of my neck. It seems to disrupt the fit of the bag less right there.

Some regulators come with a hose that threads directly into the regulator body. Some regulators come with a hose-barb, onto which a length of soft tubing can be pressed. Some regulators come with neither.

For the first situation, just thread the hose into the regulator, tighten it with a wrench, and it's ready.

(Regardless of what type of threaded fitting is used, you do need to wrench-tighten this fitting: a lot of gas can leak out at this connection. If it is a brass fitting, you should not need teflon tape on the threads; the soft metal deforms enough when tightened to provide an adequately gas-tight connection.)

For the second situation, take the hose-barb to a hardware / home improvement store and purchase tubing that fits onto the barb. Once home from the hardware store, thread the barb into the regulator body, tighten with a wrench, and press the tube onto the barb. It should be a snug fit; if you're worried it's too loose, use a small hose clamp / jubilee clip to secure it in place. If it's a little too tight to get the hose into place, soak the end of the tube in very hot water to soften it and press it onto the barb. I used clear vinyl tubing. Aquarium tubing should work. Surgical tubing may not; I don't know for sure.

For the third situation, you'll need a hose-barb fitting (typically brass) that threads into the regulator body. Take the entire regulator to the hardware store and ask someone to help you fit it with a hose barb. Then proceed as for the second situation.

Cover story: as with purchasing the gas cylinder, you're using N2 for brewing, or Ar for filling partial paint cans. Why Ar? because it's heavier than air and settles down onto the paint surface inside the can. For extra confidence that they won't ask inconvenient questions, you're doing it for your father, or your brother, and you don't know why they want it for their paint locker, they just said to get a hose barb and six feet of tubing…

The Exit Bag:

There are several videos on YouTube detailing construction of exit bags. I strongly recommend watching them. That's how I learned.

The short version of what you want is a turkey roasting bag —available in the supermarket, in with the zip-locks and cling wrap— with an elastic drawcord worked into a turned hem, and a cord-lock to adjust the drawcord's tension.

I used 3/8"" elastic cord. I purchased both it and the cord lock at a sewing and crafts store (JoAnn's).

To construct the turned hem you'll need micropore (surgical) tape, available at a pharmacy in the first aid section. It's the right tape to use because it will reliably stick to the material of the bag itself. Sometimes it isn't labeled as ""micropore."" Ask a clerk if you can't find it.

Cover story: you were asked to re-stock the family first aid kit with micropore tape and you don't recognize any of the brands available.

Using an elastic drawcord is important: it needs to fit snugly around your neck, but not seal tightly. It must still be flexible enough for the flow of inert gas, lightly pressurizing the exit bag, to push past the elastic and flush away the CO2 you're exhaling. Don't use a non-elastic drawcord or do something like duct tape the bag to your neck; you don't want to create a seal, just a restriction.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Exit bag and inert gas megathread,142576,TiredHorse,"Nov 28, 2018 at 11:21 PM","To Use:

If I found all this on the internet, I'm sure you can, but maybe these will address a few of the questions I've encountered here.

Start by sitting upright in a chair. My understanding is that you should not be lying down, and that you want to be confident you won't fall over when you black out, as any final twitching with your head rumpling the bag against whatever you are lying on might displace the bag enough to allow the inert gas to escape.

I have heard fears of convulsions with this method, but I have also heard —more plausibly— that accounts of convulsions are more accurately associated with sedated-suffocation (a predecessor to this inert gas technique) rather than to inert gas asphyxiation. However, a few final twitches are possible as the electrical activity in the brain fades, and it would be tragic to have the attempt ruined by not taking the simple precaution of being sitting up and stable.

To feel confident that any post-mortem twitching will not knock the cylinder over and jerk the tube out of the exit bag, secure the cylinder to the leg of your chair. I use a piece of webbing; duct tape or a length of cord would work.

If you wear glasses, as I do, remove them. They will be a hindrance when you need to pull the gas-filled bag down over your face, and will allow space for air to remain in the bag.

To pre-fit the drawcord, pull the bag down over your head and face. Tighten the elastic drawcord around your neck so that it's snug, but not cinched tight. You should be able to fit your fingers under it.

Lift the bag up off your face so that the drawcord is now around your temples and just above your eyebrows, below your ears and around the back of your neck, like a shower cap. After adjusting the drawcord to your neck, it will feel tight around your head; this is good.

Scrunch ALL the air out of the bag. The more air you can remove, the faster the inert gas will take effect. If you ignore this step, your attempt will likely fail.

At this point the end of the hose should be inside the bag. I have long hair, so I secure the end of the hose at the back of my head with a hair elastic. Others have taped the end of the hose securely to the inside of the bag with more micropore tape.

If you have long hair, like I do, make sure it is bundled up inside the exit bag, not sticking out under the drawcord.

With the regulator closed, open the valve of the cylinder. There will be a sharp hiss as the regulator fills.

Open the regulator and adjust the flow of gas to 15Lpm. The gas flowing through the tube was surprisingly loud to me, and a bit distracting. Someone here kindly recommended earplugs, which I may do on my next attempt. Or I may listen to music; I doubt earbud wires will displace the drawcord.

The bag will gradually inflate above your head. It will take a minute or two to reach full inflation.

As the bag is inflating, take deep breaths, exhaling fully, to purge as much CO2 as possible from the depths of your lungs.

When the bag is inflated and you're ready, exhale as completely as possible and hold your lungs empty. Slide the bag down over your face and settle the elastic comfortably around your neck. Finally, inhale as deeply as possible; breathe slowly and deeply.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Each of the three times I have attempted this method, that's as far as I got before I flinched and removed the bag.

I did not experience any pain whatsoever, and no real discomfort aside from the mild tingling in my hands.

I do not believe I have suffered any ill effects from three aborted attempts. I had a bit of a cough for a couple days after my third attempt, but I can't say for sure whether that was attributable to the N2. It concerns me only in that this method demands that you be able to breathe freely in order for it to be effective, and I don't want to have ruined my chances to use it later, when I have summoned my courage.

My greatest difficulty is that I have been very stressed during my attempts, and could not keep my breathing steady and deep. This undoubtedly lengthened the amount of time it should have taken for me to black out.

In the stress of the situation, I experienced time dilation —in other words, I can't tell you how long it took for me to feel dizzy; it might have been five seconds, it might have been a minute and a half. It wasn't very long —but it was long enough for me to flinch.

From my experience, this is as painless, comfortable, and potentially peaceful a way to ctb as it is rumored to be. The only drawbacks that I can see are that it requires a lot of equipment —cylinder, regulator, hose, bag— and that there is a surprising amount of time for your survival instinct to kick in, or for second thoughts.

As I wrote at the beginning, I hope other forum members can fill in some of the blanks I have left —specifically, I have seen a lot of questions about tank sizes outside the US that I cannot answer.

I don't wish anyone good luck at catching the bus. I wish we could all find our way to a joyous and satisfying life that would make death an unfortunate reality rather than a longed-for relief. But all of us here know that the Fates aren't always that kind, and so I wish you all the most peaceful relief from your pain that you can find, and if that peace is brought by Death, I hope Death comes gently.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Exit bag and inert gas megathread,142995,TiredHorse,"Nov 29, 2018 at 11:07 AM","Generally speaking, you won't damage the valve by handling the tank normally.

The gas stores worry about you putting the tank in the back of your car, unsecured, and then on the way home there's an accident, the valve is damaged, and the tank takes off like a rocket. (There are many YouTube videos about compressed gas cylinder incidents if you want to see dramatic examples of what can happen.)

I mentioned the possibility of gas cylinder damage only because the stores have often asked me questions akin to, ""you do know to be careful and to secure that tank properly, right?"" and because I've had friends tell me of gas stores requiring a waiver be signed that the purchaser knows the tanks need to be carried safely.

Exit bag and inert gas megathread,144258,TiredHorse,"Nov 30, 2018 at 1:20 PM","I agree with Shewaitsforme: you would have a difficult time reducing the available O2 in such a large, gas-permeable space. Technically yes, you could do it, but it would take a lot of N2 and careful preparation of the car.

Don't confuse inert gas asphyxiation (IGA) with CO poisoning. They work through completely different mechanisms.

With IGA you are displacing O2 from your environment, thus depriving your body of necessary O2, while flushing away the CO2 that would trigger your body's hypercapnic alarm and cause involuntary self-preservation. To effectively displace the O2, you need a controlled environment from which the O2 can first be flushed and then excluded. So first you need to get rid of all the air, then you need to keep out any further air, then you need to flush away your exhaled CO2. The smaller the space, and the more readily the space is sealed, the easier this is to accomplish.

When you put an exit bag over your head, you are creating a low-O2 environment. The CO2 is flushed away by the constant flow of inert gas, preventing alarm, and you are allowing your body to use up whatever O2 it has in its bloodstream while not providing it any more.

Short version: The O2 in your body runs out and isn't replaced.

With CO poisoning, you aren't displacing air/O2 from the environment; you are introducing into the environment a molecule (CO) which binds more readily to your blood than O2 does. You're providing your haemoglobin with an easier alternative than O2; your body grabs the CO and ignores the O2. Since your blood can only carry so many gas molecules at a time, with the CO taking up all the room in your bloodstream your body is starved of O2.

When you climb into your car with a barbecue that's putting out CO, there's still plenty of O2 in the car's environment. You're not excluding the O2 as you need to do with IGA --replacing the air with a completely different gas-- you're adding to the existing air a new substance (CO) that your body prefers to O2. This preferential-molecule process makes it much simpler to manage the environment on a large scale. You don't need to get rid of the O2, you just need to provide enough CO to take up all the space for O2 in your bloodstream.

Short version: The O2 available to your body is ignored in favor of CO.",143950,,,,,,,,,,,
A Dark Return: Death Notes – Psych Ward – Rehab,2662423,Hysteria,"Sep 8, 2024 at 7:02 AM","It pains me deeply to write this. I've let you down. I promised to share the outcome of my CTB attempt, but here I am – it failed, and in many ways, so did I.

In January 2024, I tried Night Night, hoping it would end everything. Instead, I found myself barely conscious, shaking and nauseous. In that state, I answered a call from my partner. Desperate and defeated, I let her convince me to seek help. I checked myself into the psych ward.

The psych ward was a mixed bag. I found a strange peace in the medications they gave me, which helped me through opioid withdrawal. I never thought I'd survive that, but somehow, I did. The journey wasn't easy – the injections brought no comfort, only calmness as I endured. Yet, the psych ward saved me in ways I hadn't expected.

After three months, they recommended drug rehab. Grateful to be free of my opioid dependence, I agreed. Rehab, however, was an entirely different ordeal. Five months of no music, no movies, no privacy – just work I despised and moments of abuse. It was unbearable, so I left.

I only wish living life could be as simple. But for now, I'm still here, with you. If you've thought of me, thank you.

,2665519,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 10, 2024 at 1:46 PM","I've been cooking up my SN plan while I wait to get paid so I can purchase Meto and Propranolol. But I'd like some feedback on my plan just to double check if it's all good. Plus I am unsure of the P dosage, usage, and effects which I'll explain below.

Here's my SN plan:


Fast for 12 or so hours (last meal finished before 12am the night before)

10:00 Cease consumption of water for 2 hours before SN (drinking water to swallow meds though)

10:30 1hr 30m before, take 40mg (40mg X1) of Propranolol

11:00 1hr before take 975mg (325mg X3) of Tylenol

11:20 40 minutes before, take stat dose of 30mg (10mg X3) Metoclopramide and another 40mg of Propranolol

Sometime after taking Meto and P, mix 2 glasses with 50ml of water and 25g of SN each, then wait remaining time

12:00 after roughly ~40 minutes, drink SN


Does the timing of all of this look good? Would you change anything? Additional question, after vomiting (which is likely to happen), should I immediately take my backup glass? or should I wait a short while to give my stomach a brief respite?


As for Propranolol, I have several questions:

First off, I read in a medical journal study that was testing P dosages for POTS sufferers that peak concentrations in the blood stream occur at ~90 minutes after ingestion, with onset effects beginning at ~60 minutes after ingestion (though I've read elsewhere that the onset effects begin at 30 minutes, so I'm not sure). The low effective dose in the study was 20mg, so I'm quadrupling it for myself since I'm dealing with SN here and that can make your heart go bonkers. I know the old dosage suggested by the PPH and forum members used to be anywhere from 400mg to 620mg, but this is an extremely high dose and apparently this is inadvisable due to risk of atrial fibrillation, heart arrhythmia, and other unforeseen side effects. Additionally, if one fails with SN and they've taken a high dosage of P, they can have permanent heart issues. And for heart rate reduction, a therapeutic dose for anxiety is enough (10-30mg) for a measurable reduction in heart rate, and higher and higher doses possibly have diminishing returns with increased side effects and risks. So a lower dosage is better it seems, and as such I think 80mg is probably my best bet, as opposed to several hundred mg. Besides, I'm not trying to completely eliminate tachycardia. I just don't want to endure potentially 200 fucking beats per minute till I pass out, so if I can get that down to something like 120-140, I'm cool with that. When I had a lung collapse, my heart rate almost reached 190 at one point and generally hovered between the 170's and the 180's (same trigger mechanism as SN: substantially reduced oxygen saturation, triggering the brain to increase heart rate to compensate). It was so uncomfortable and disconcerting. A lot of people say tachycardia is nothing to worry about and won't add any distress, but absolutely not in my case. I do not want to experience that again. So I'd like to avoid that in my final moments since SN has more than enough discomforting effects. While Propranolol is now seen as a luxury item, it's almost a necessity for me.

My questions here are:

Is 80mg total a good dose in your opinion? Should I up it a bit to to get my desired heart rate range? Or is 80mg too high for a first time dose (never took the med before)? It's higher than a therapeutic dose (since we're talking about SN here and I'll definitely need something a bit stronger than that), but it's lower than some of the dosages other members have used years ago which ranged from 120-320mg (and going further back, as previously stated, 400-620mg!).

How about the timing of ingestion? A user here on SS reported peak effects of Propranolol at around 47 minutes, while medical studies show the effects kick in fully at around 60-90 minutes, so I'm not sure here. This is why I've spaced out the dose, taking 40mg 90min prior so it for sure reaches peak concentration by the time I take my SN, and another 40mg 40 min before SN that should begin taking some additional effect by then; in theory, the concentration will continue to increase while I'm enduring the symptoms of SN, so it may help as I'm going through it. Does this sounds like a good plan? Anyone have any additional information about the effective timing of this drug?

Is it alright taking the second Propran at the same time as the Meto? I've researched both drugs, and they have no interactions. But will taking these two drugs at the same time inhibit their abilities to saturate my blood stream quick enough? They'll have about 40 minutes to enter the bloodstream and concentrate.

Anyone taking Propranolol for a medical issue that could offer some insight into dosage and subsequent effects? Any words of advice?

Anyone else using P in their SN plan have any feedback here? What's your dosage and timing for P and the reasoning behind it?

I dont understand those survivor type people who have underground housing just in case of an apocalypse. Like, why would you want to live through that?! It makes no sense to me.

I think will to live comes naturally to most people. For me, I cant find a will to live because all of this is so nonsensical and I have a terrible time building/keeping connections. People who are suicidal probably shouldn't seek out new connections anyways because it is just going to hurt that person in the end. It's a catch 22 when I attempt to live. I could just be prolonging someone else's suffering by getting them more attached to me. Why make someone else go through all that for no reason?


I dont think it is super common for people of such a young age to have suicidal ideations, but I have heard of a few cases like this. I feel like some people are shielded from knowing suicide is even a thing and maybe wouldn't naturally have thought of methods on their own without hearing of someone else doing it first whether it is a historically significant person or someone they knew in real life. For example, I used to want to die terribly but would want someone else to harm me, had never really been able to think about hurting myself until about 10 years ago. Idk what snapped but then I was ready to harm myself permanently. I still wanted to do it in the most peaceful way possible though. Then I tried prozac and now I really don't give af what happens to my body. Prozac made me have violent suicidal thoughts with just an overwhelming amount of joy from visualizing my own blood.

Way back when, as a very little girl, I was lonely. My parents were young and were not ready for the responsibility of two kids, they fell far apart in good time, always at each others throats.

I don't blame them for my upbringing, I genuinely don't think they could have done better, I was just born into this life, just as I have flaws, so do they and so 'did' they, they were still growing. They are different people now even from a couple of years ago.

My father lived away from most people so at his home, which he insists is also mine, I did not get to have friends over, even if they were willing to make the trip. Not even cousins could visit, he seemed ashamed of the state of his home. I did not see the problem.

There, I also had a small room and to avoid clutter I could not keep many toys there, or much of anything.

To be honest, I do not remember how I spent those days, he wanted me to play outside but I did not want to be alone and he did not want to play with me. So we were at an impasse.

My mother's house was different, I had a bigger room with a lot of toys and books but she never played with me either. I think I learned to settle early on, I learned it was better to be alone and in a daze than lonely and aware.

My father's hesitation to invite others into his home was something I learned, it made it hard to make friends, I couldn't play out alone at my mother's and it felt odd inviting others around.

I did not have a bad upbringing, I just couldn't break through and force myself not to be alone. Even now I only have a single friend. Because all relationships are hard, I learned that from my parents.

I had good opportunities, I was a smart kid and my parents worked hard but I don't think I ever fell into the right place and that makes me tired.

I'm always so tired. Through the good and the bad. Rain or sun, I can't wait until the day I crawl into bed, fall asleep with the sun shining through my window onto my face and never wake up again.

I am tired because I know I have it good but I'm sick of it all nonetheless, and I think that makes me a bad person. Not in a 'you should strive to be better' kind of way, but more in a 'I have a poor nature and I no longer feel guilty about it' way.

I hate that eventually I get bored of everything and I know that given that choice I would eventually stop working altogether. I hate that not working during these years of my life would make it harder to get a job later.

I hate that I will need a job later.

No, I am not. I am, of course, capable of doing good things and I do not consistently choose the wrong path however I shall define this good and bad debate a little more clearly.

I recently purchased for a friend of mine some glasses, her poor vision means that without such an aid, she cannot read. I did not deliberate on this and I had insisted that no repayment be necessary. Is this in itself a good act? I would think so however, I took this action lightly, I did not place value on it myself. I simply did as I did because I have the means to do so.

On the other hand, when I was in high school during a wood-tech class I spied a £20 note on the floor. I suspected with some confidence that said money belonged to a friend of mine sitting at that same table. I slid it under my foot and picked it up when she was otherwise engaged. I kept that money wholly for myself and never told her.

In essence, I stole it.

I thought more of this choice, I could have returned the money, I could have pretended not to see it but I chose for myself to take the money that did not belong to me.

I engaged more with a negative decision, I willingly ignored feelings of guilt or apprehension and made a choice. This choice had more of an impact on me and I do not and did not feel guilty for taking it.

I am capable of doing good things and when I do such things, I do them purely as a token not a transaction. I expect nothing in return. These acts mean very little to me, whereas when I do bad things they mean much more to me as they are typically selfish.

I appreciate the bad choices I make more than the good ones. I feel that being a worse person is inherently more valuable and fulfilling than being a good one and with this I feel that regardless of all the good things I do, I will always be a bad person.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I want what I can't have and everything I have in the meantime heads speedily towards a certain end, but only when I remember it. Living in the moment seems to take ever so long.

There's a park in my village, it's situated behind my grandmother's house, who died last year. There's a bench I can sit on there, it is adjacent to the hedge bordering that house's back garden. When I sit on that bench it's like the whole world is debating whether to swallow me whole or abandon me entirely.

When I'm sat on that bench, the clouds can move at break-neck speed or creep so slowly across the sky it's as if they don't move at all.

Sometimes the entire sky is grey, there's no texture and barely any variety in the shades of grey that hang heavily above.

Sometimes it rains, spitting, a wet mist or a thunderous downpour. You can see the weather from that bench, it often seems like that bench is the only place where I can see the world.

In front of that bench, as with so many parks, is grass. Grass so green I never believe it's real, not even when I'm staring straight at it. That grass that winds moves through leaving it dancing. The grass that on a hot Summer's day can stand as still as the gravel footpath beside it.

That grass, so close in front of me, the grass I don't touch, the grass I stare at wishing I didn't have to go home.

When it's sunny and windy, well that's the perfect combination, fluffy clouds straight out of a painting drifting at a leisurely pace, grass that sways in a delicate and warm breeze. A bright blue sky and a bird that always circles over head.

If every day were forecast to be the same, only changed by my own actions then perhaps I would be happy. Or maybe I would be miserable for being the only one with the ability to make a difference a responsibility I'm not sure I could ever handle.

My job requires I do not make mistakes but mistakes come naturally to me. I want to be perfect, the stress of not being so bothers me far more than I would like to admit. When things go wrong I try to brush them off as inevitable and when I'm chided for missing a beat I pretend that it's okay and I expect myself to do so. In truth it really bothers me.

I don't simply wish to die or disappear because I'm sad, it's because I don't want to face a world in which I know I'll never be the person I want to be. Because I know that in this world I will continue to make benign mistakes and still have to defend myself against myself for them.

I don't want to image living another 70 to 80 years where all my defining moments will be the ones where I fuck up. Imagining the future makes me so tired but if I don't die and I don't at least try to plan for it, then I'm bound fail even worse.

I have already made plenty of mistakes and missed plenty of opportunities, ones I will never get back I can't dream of the opportunities that will come in the future and so I know I'll miss most of those too. I may as well be paralysed that I keep myself from doing so many things or don't even think of these things.

I want to die because it's easier than living but living in a way that leads swiftly to death is difficult too, more difficult than placidly waiting for life to pass me by. I am just not that great of an individual to take care of this particular want myself.

Because if you want to die, but fail to do so often your own actions, life just becomes that much harder and I am trying to avoid that.

How does one become happy? Why is it that we can be happy without perfect circumstances or is it that we have all simply learned to settle for what we can get?

Is settling a bad thing? Ought we claw at ourselves for anything less than perfect? I'm not asking if we should be able to achieve perfection or if our not achieving it is worth celebrating but rather, what is the measure of our happiness.

What is it worth? We do settle because life is not perfect, but in that case by what do we measure what makes us happy, how much can we concede before the little things aren't worth it anymore?

At what point is life so imperfect that we can no longer be happy with it? We can be happy to spend time with our family, happy to briefly see them, happy just to hear their voice and yet at times none of this is enough.

I got to the main gate and considered not going inside but someone I know noticed and waved me over. There was some kind illness going around. Something to do with blood, I don't really know anymore about it than that.



Later on I was running through a rather large house, people were yelling something about freedom, not being slaves.



I was armed with some kind of automatic gun and a knife. I ran into one of the rooms and found a dead man and a pregnant woman. There was a language barrier. She yelled and I tried to quiet her. I almost fought her before I realised she was with child.



I begged her to stay quiet, she wouldn't. So I put the gun to her head and brought her to another hallway. She still struggled but did not shout, due to the gun.



We reached a door in the hallway, it was my way out, I tried to communicate that she should come with me.



I knew if there were more of my people in the house they wouldn't spare her. I wasn't going to either, until I realised her current state.



I took my hand away from her mouth, and lowered my gun to show I didn't want to hurt her.



I watched her take a deep inhale and then she screamed.



She shouted so loud you could hear her from the furthest point in the house.



So, I pulled her back to me and I slit her throat.



I stepped out of the hallway into my escape route, I ran.



Then I woke up.

I don't know why things happened the way they did in that dream, I don't even know what I was doing. I suppose it is better not to know.

It isn't as if I'm always the aggressor, I often am not, still that nightmare bothered me because of course it would.

I can only hope that I don't have it again. Sometimes I remember that I've had a dream before, even whilst dreaming again. Sometimes remembering changes the outcome, sometimes it doesn't.

I have to dreamt as much this last year, the dreams I have had, I tend to forget very quickly, that may be for the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,

ENG: Hello to all dear forum users.

I have a lot of respect for the creators of this forum and its community and I hope you understand and agree with the relevance of creating this thread.
This thread is more like a little Russian Chat. Nothing special.


Yesterday I created a thread about my planned CTB, where I mentioned that I am from Russia. Several users from Russia joined the discussion, so we started communicating in Russian, which became uncomfortable for the rest of the community. As a result, we just started translating our messages into English in addition to the original Russian.

I wrote this thread to create a place for Russian-speaking users to ask any questions or share anything in their native language. That is, the main language will be Russian, but anyone will be able to answer or read using a translator if they wish.
This doesn't seem to be such a serious violation of the rules, I hope the administration will let me create this thread.

Feel free to ask anything in English, I'm sure most of the Russian users speak good English. But I assume that initially the conversation will be aimed at the Russian audience without translation into English.",,,,,,,,,,,,

На сколько я понял - всё зависит от чистоты SN. Это может быть микс, например доступная на тех же маркетплейсах Нитритовая соль, которую используют для готовки. В ней содержание Нитрита Натрия ~0.5%, что конечно не летально.
Но при должной дозировке чистого SN (точную дозировку можно найти в соответствующих темах) летальный исход более чем вероятен.

Что происходит после того, как ты выпил разведенный SN? Ну, пьётся оно легко. На вкус как аквариумная вода, слегка солёная. Тебя может тошнить, а самое главное - ты начнёшь ощущать сильную нехватку воздуха, тебе будет тяжело дышать. Как быстро ты потеряешь сознание - точно не знаю, вроде бы это опционально.

Я могу ошибаться, так как мнения правда разнятся.

У меня под это отдельный тред, но кратко - я решил попробовать OD с героином. Учитывая отсутствие толерантности шанс выжить минимален. Из плюсов: ты потеряешь сознание почти моментально, не успев почувствовать любое недомогание. Плюс это наркотик, опиоид, поэтому мысли будут строиться легче и совершенно по другому (но ты толком и не успеешь подумать). Единственный минус: нужно какое-то время, чтобы организм прекратил свою работу. Это не моментально, может занять от получаса до нескольких, а то и десятка часов.
Всё это зависит от чистоты героина. Единственный вариант: Дарк нет шопы. А вот наверняка знать заранее какая чистота у героина - ты не можешь, кроме как проведя собственные тесты и анализы. Но сейчас вижу, что подобные способы начинают все больше замечать и выдвигать вперёд, вместо SN

Ну и конечно есть риск быть принятым полицией + героин стоит денег. Все рекомендуют 1.5 грамма внутривенно, а это довольно дорого.",2175875,,,,,,,,,,,

I've been on this planet for 25 years, I feel like I've seen all I need to see and have no desire to see much more. There are so many problems that I don't even think I could list them but financially I'm in a horrible position, my hair has thinned so bad it's getting hard to keep hair anymore as the density is so different all over my head, I've got asymetical features that I hate, my jaw is really weird and looks pathetic in selfies, I have a lazy eye (Stabismus) and to top it all off, I was a shut in for years in my late teens/early 20's, got morbidly obese, lost 80kg since then but obviously this means I'm left with loose skin all over my body and every time I see myself in the mirror I want to cry. I know some of these problems won't seem THAT big to others, but they are to me. Of course the caveat is that in theory, money can solve a lot of my problems where as others aren't quite so lucky with theirs. I could (if I had the financial means) get multiple loose skin removal surgies, I could get cosmetic surgery on my jaw and I could get eye surgery to strengthen my nerves in my right eye so it becomes slightly more realligned. The issue is, I'm broke. I have 5 euro in my bank account and that's it. I'm basically broke as one can be.

I guess the question I'm trying to ask is, can someone who doesn't want help, be helped? I don't want to live anymore, I've made peace with that decision but my parents are trying to make me feel guilty about how much it'll impact their lives but why should I have to continue living in a world that every day I woke up I think ""f**k, I wish I died in my sleep"" just because others want me to? I tried to give life one more go, when I was 160kg I had basically written off life and was just living until I got so fat my heart couldn't take it anymore and stopped. I'm still miserable, in fact, I'm actually more miserable now than I was when I could barely walk up the stairs without feeling out of breath because at least then I felt like my day would come, I'd finally die because my health was so poor.

Just talking things through with therapists can be really useful.

,2662655,Grumble,"Sep 8, 2024 at 11:00 AM","First I'd look at the different kinds of ""help"".

There is ""help"" that keeps you alive. This is when you're acutely suicidal and you ""voluntarily involuntarily"" go into a hospital to get through the period where you feel you're in immediate risk of suicide. This is more about survival than anything else.

Then there is ""help"" that looks to improve your situation. This is what most people immediately think of when they hear the word ""help"" or ""therapy"". There are many different treatment approaches, medications, etc.

And then there is ""help"" that is more about acceptance -- accepting your life for what it is, trying to make peace with it, and just trying to keep suffering as minimized as possible.

If you've never sought out help before, then it's probably worth giving a serious look at it. I was someone who strongly rejected the idea of anyone or anything being able to do anything for me. I ""didn't want it."" That is, until I actually had it forced upon me, and to my surprise, I learned my preconceived notions about it were wrong.

So, you might surprise yourself. If the other option is death, then you probably don't have much to lose by checking it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,

That being said
-you don't seem to be going anywhere at the moment in terms of dying

So you don't have much to lose by going, although understandable motivations will be low and it'll feel like there is no point, not really wanting to show up, ect

Sure, meds might help you reach the point of being willing and eager to get help, but not always. And if they don't, then talk therapy becomes useless. Unless your therapist is really able to get through to you and convince you that you want the help, then you're talking to a wall. The only times I've ever made temporary gains in my mental health have been when I am in a place where I want to get better and get help. That's one of the trickiest things about mental health care vs physical health care. You can take antibiotics for an infection even if you don't want to and the infection will still go away.

They believe therapy can help you, you don't. It all boils down to if you are open to the idea, that the therapist can change your mind about therapy.

It also depends on what kind of help you are talking about. You mentioned certain problems which cannot be truly solved with therapy alone. They would require practical help, and yes, money is a huge part of that. If you could get help consisting of many parts, let's say, parents helping you financially, getting emotional support from other people, eventually you helping yourself financially, and then solving your problems with your skin and your hair, it would mean a lot.

If all of this was available to you, I think you could try doing something about your problems for 12 months.

Probably will do ketamine or other drugs that day and smoke hella

1 hour before take 1000mg of paracetamol
40 minutes before take 3 X 10mg Metoclopramide
Wait 40 minutes
Take 25g of SN
Take Lorazepam (How much should I take?)

When I took 0.5mg Lorazepam (my prescribed daily amount) I haven't felt anything really so I took 1mg a couple of times, felt a little dizzy sometimes but snapped out of it really quick every time, only took it 3 times so far.

However when I take Clonazepam it hits me like a truck and every single time I have taken it (Also about 3 times) I have just got really sleepy and fell asleep after a while

I have a family history of young-onset Alzheimer's disease. I had to watch this horrifically cruel disease take my dad piece by piece over the course of about 5 years. The thought of having to go through that myself, and making those close to me witness it, is something I fear much more than death.

My dad started showing symptoms of the disease in his mid-late 50's, and I'm only in my early 30s now, so realistically I have 20-30 years, but I still can't stop thinking about it. I know deep down I want to die by my own hand rather than suffer like that, but it's so far away.

If I do develop the disease, the trick is to try to catch it early enough so I still have enough of my faculties to actually ctb, which kinda terrifies me. What if I wait too long and don't have the ability to follow through anymore? That would be literally the worst thing I could imagine--having my mind slowly decay over the course of several years and having no way to put myself out of my misery and unburden my loved ones.

There's also the chance I might not develop the disease, which is a possibility that terrifies me almost as much. If I make it to my 60s with all my faculties, I'll be constantly paranoid that any old brain fart could be the onset of full-blown Alzheimer's.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2655319,TAW122,"Sep 2, 2024 at 1:11 PM","Over the years on SaSu, most of us have been unfairly and inaccurately portrayed by many news media organizations and journalists who are acting in bad faith. This isn't just limited to the NYT, WaPo, BBC, and/or many other big news organizations that writes articles or reports their story (often with an malicious agenda to try to smear, misrepresent, or otherwise inaccurately and incorrectly represent us). So this thread is partly a vent, but mostly an article to address that problem.

Also, recently with whole drama of BBC about a week ago or so, and the fixers (who I won't name), and many more, it only further cements my position that we do need an independent, third party, in good-faith journalist (I know it's unlikely, but just offering that up as a potential solution) in order to accurately and realistically represent what SaSu really is. SaSu is a community of people who are united by a common trait, suffering through sentience and find camaraderie in discussing various taboo topics (especially the right to die, voluntary euthanasia, and even the philosophy of death, suicide, etc.) without censorship and also a safe place where they can do so without being intervened against, goaded into sentience or pro-life rhetoric and platitudes, and being heard instead of being dismissed.

So assuming we have some people who are passionate enough and have enough resources, perhaps we could have a self-reporting, self-representing organization ourselves and that way we would be able to accurately represent what SaSu really stands for and be able to shed us in a positive and accurate light. Or perhaps for some other honest, independent journalist (might be a paradox or hard to find, not sure) to accurately represent what SaSu is. This idea was something I had in mind after the last few years of bad faith reporting by the media as well as bad actors seeking to harm the SaSu community.

While the drawback of this idea is that one could mistakenly misinterpret such an organization for either being pro-CTB, or prejudiced in some way, I still think it's better than having dishonest, unscrupulous mainstream media outlets incorrectly and inaccurately reporting on our community. Furthermore, having our own community act as our PR would at least allow us to represent ourselves in a more accurate light while debunking and doing away with the harm that mainstream media outlets as well as bad faith journalists have.

That's a possible concern as well, but I think if it helps us counter more of the bad faith press about us, it may be a small 'win', or like if we had our own video (not on a mainstream platform) of what our community is like, perhaps that could also disspell some of the biased negative perceptions that the media has stirred up about us.

@RainAndSadness , I see that you reacted with a ""like"" to @TAW122 's first post. I know you are probably busy, but I'd really like to

@TAW122 's first post was a general idea, which needs to be put into concrete steps. I offered one specific step of writing a page
for the media. Another specific step would be just to gain expertise. I have several books about the media,
for example ""Winning with the News Media: A Self-Defense Manual When You're the Story"", which I have read long
ago. I could reread that. We could find additional resources. I am sure there are other resources where we can learn from.

Also, there is additional input that we would need from the mods that would be very valuable.
For example, has the site been approached by journalists? What were their questions and how did you reply?

Another related question I have is that there are SaSu members who are not mods but might like to
help in more substantial ways, other then replying to fleeting threads. How would one go about that?

,2664543,Forever Sleep,"Sep 9, 2024 at 5:12 PM","Yeah, it would be wonderful if it was properly/ fairly represented or portrayed by someone but- they would have to be such a maverick. Would you reveal who you are and what you believe in openly to the world? It would invite a lot of hate for that person themselves. Partly because of what they are saying but also because they could be seen to be encouraging people to come here (... and die- that's how I imagine their relatives will see it.)

Portraying it truthfully as a place where people can feel supported without a whole bunch of pro-life platitudes, plus gain access to the most reliable methods would likely terrify most 'normies'. Do they even want us to have 'peer' support? I imagine they'd prefer it if we were limited to more life affirming resources.

If the target audience are 'normies'. People who aren't suicidal themselves, just how do you think we could honestly portray this place so that they would accept it? Just the name of it is going to scare the shit out of them! A place where suicide is ok to talk about and ok to do. I doubt they'd want that for their loved ones or children I suspect. I think it would take incredibly understanding people to see it as a good thing. I kind of suspect the majority of users here come here in secret. If we can't even tell our family members about it, how would a journalist do much better?

I would really like a study made on the effectiveness or rather- ineffectiveness of suicide being such a taboo subject to discuss. Does it truly help someone's mental well being not being able to talk about it- if they have those thoughts and drives? I really wish someone would do research on that.

I know what you mean though. I wish journalists would at least do thorough research. Not just go for a sensational story. Portray the good and the bad of somewhere like this. For me- journalists ought to be public servants. They ought to be researching and reporting on social issues in an intelligent and thorough way- for the good of everyone. Not just churning out basically soap opera shallow level drama because that's what people buy.

Why do people seek out a place like this to begin with? Why do people stay here? What's the appeal? Is it an echo chamber? Anymore than other social platforms are? Is that really dangerous? Are people here really that gullible or vulnerable that they even could be influenced to take their own life? Not that that goes on but it could be argued that we don't always put up opposition to someone doing it- if they seem sure. Isn't it clear that people here can thoroughly reason why they want to commit suicide? Why recovery hasn't worked for them? Is unlikely to work for them? The resources they've made use of and why they failed?

Sometimes I feel like- this place is a goldmine of guinea pigs. People who- ok annonymously but are openly screaming out that they feel suicidal. If I were in this business- a therapist, psychiatrist- whatever. The sorts of people who are presumably keen on helping people not to feel suicidal, I think I'd be interested in talking to people here. I wonder if any ever do. The people who make decisions for us effectively. Do they even care all that much about people on the ground level?",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2665358,daley,"Sep 10, 2024 at 11:40 AM","I agree that targeting 'normies' is incredibly challenging, but we don't have to target the 'normies'.
Our goal could be just to have more suicidal people be aware of SaSu.
which is what is happening anyway when we get media exposure.
But perhaps we could help improve on messaging to those people, through the media.

Viewed that way, our situation isn't so bleak.


The place, being a ""goldmine of guinea pigs"" as you say, may also be a goldmine for pro-choice stories.
I think that is what the media needs - captivating stories.

I have skimmed through ""Dismantling the allegation that we're pro-suicide"" of @RainAndSadness to the media. Its a lot to read through.
It's great and thorough. It has links to ""stories"" - SaSu threads about people who feel they ""recovered"" after their participation on SaSu.

But I am embarrassed to say that I haven't read it through yet. It's not just that the post is long, but
it also contains many important links which require further reading.
I do wish these response and links were consolidated and better organized, and pointed to via a link from the main page.
Putting such replies in sticky posts would not be trivial to find for a reporter.

The weariness of RainAndSadness is understandable. Perhaps a solution could be to delegate to somebody like @TAW122 to do
such rewriting. There are people that want to contribute to SaSu, and this can even be strangely therapeutic in providing
some purpose. I am in such a situation as well. It's a win-win.",2664543,2664543,,,,,,,,,,

,2592210,Deficiency,"Jul 10, 2024 at 8:17 PM","I think I am just better off dead


The only reason I stay is for others but, they will be far better without me


I am useless. I bring nothing to any kind of table. There are no talents in me. My fingers can barely play a melody. My voice can barely tell an interesting story. My arms can barely move things. There is nothing extraordinary about me. Even the things I'm good at, I'm average at. Just average. If I left, why would anyone miss me? Really? I would leave no empty space in anyone's life


I am not memorable. Not in a good way. Just seen as a nutjob or a bitch. I suppose that's all there really is to me.


Maybe I am a looney. I shouldn't have this fractured of a mind. I shouldn't have anything and everything be a trigger. It's constant. ""man this kitchen is clean. Hey remember how filthy and probably toxic the kitchen you grew up with was? Ohhh yeah and how you'd sometimes go days without any heating or electricity?"" Even just seeing a loving mother or father with their child immediately makes me question ""why couldn't I have that?"". And even now, when life is good, I finally met the love of my life after 10 years of waiting - and I still just want to end things.


I don't think I can be fixed. I think my mind is too disordered by all these years. I will never be able to function. I will never be able to be a good person. I will forever just crawl along. And forever let people down. I can't even look after myself for god sake.


Everyone's life would be no different really. And I barely message people anymore. Maybe all these months of isolating myself was in preparation for my death. Maybe I couldn't admit to myself it was going to happen. But. Subconsciously I knew. I've been preparing everyone for a while. My absence really won't be that much different.


There's nothing to miss about me. I'm a mood leech, I'm always negative. No one wants to be around someone as tragic as me. I'm a downer. I just bring people down. I'm not good at anything, I have no skills. I'm not the next Picasso or Einstein. No talent would be wasted. My face will never be missed. I am an eye sore. It hurts to look in the mirror. It saddens me that this is the face that people see. No one will want to look at a photograph of me. No one will want to remember me


It's not like I've don't anything with my life anyway. All I've done year upon year, is exist despite everything. But what cause for celebration is it really? Other people have it worse than me. And look at me. I have a flat, I have food, I have an income, I have the love of my life. Life is wonderful. But my brain is just too tapped. I damaged myself too much over the years out of hatred after years of hatred from my father. And now, I will never be happy. I don't deserve to be. I don't deserve anything apart from pain. But even when you accept your fate, you get tired I suppose. I reached 24 years. And I don't see any future for myself. I can't see myself ever climbing out of this hole. I will end up getting unwell and ruining everything. Because I will never deserve anything. I don't deserve the love that I have with my partner. And neither does he. He should not love me. I am not good for him. I just drag him down. Annoy him. I'm mean. I'm everything that he doesn't deserve. He deserves so much more than me. He deserves the world. He doesn't deserve this freak of a person.


I love him dearly. I always have. My heart has broken many times for him before when I thought I'd lost him forever. But now that I have him, here I am wanting to throw it all away. He was always the goal. But even now, I just want to go. He sees a future with me. I could see one with him, but what I see stronger for my future is nothing. I can't see myself there. I see no future with me alive. I am not meant to be here anymore. It is not fair for him to deal with my nonsense any longer. I know I am broken. I can't let him sit and pick up the pieces for me anymore. He doesn't deserve this. He deserves the brightest stars in the universe. He deserves the moon just like he deserves the world. He shouldn't be with a fixer-upper like me. I am too much work. I am not worth any of this effort. I am a shell of a human. And he is the brightest soul that ever lived.


I think it would be easier for him if I left now. I know I will be the cause of my end. I think I've always known that suicide was my cause of death. It has loomed over me for a very long time. Better now than down the line. I should not prolong a false happiness for him. He deserves to be happy, but all the love and happiness I give to him is tainted. It is harsh, but he will recover better if I don't prolong my life. Because in every universe, I always kill myself. It will be easier when there is less memories. Less words said. Less love shared. I am regretful of that. I have never loved someone like him. But I can't see him try and fix me anymore. He deserves so much more than that. So much more than me.

Perhaps providing editorial guidance for each other's suicide notes. Or some people simply don't like the idea of dying alone.

I suppose a local, live-and-in-person variation of the arrangement would be similar, with the added feature of planning to CTB together in the same CO-filled tent, for example. Might present some opportunities to save money by splitting the cost of certain materials.

My CTB journey is just such an intensely personal thing, such that that thought of involving another person just doesn't sit right with me. From my perspective I would rather keep things as simple as possible, and be 100% in control of the process. I want to be able to reschedule things as needed, without worrying about derailing someone else's important plans.

However for other it may be the only way they gain enough confidence to achieve their CTB dreams. Basically everyone gets to figure out what works for them, there is definitely no one-size-fits-all. I'm not even totally against the idea for myself; it just seems highly unlikely that I'll encounter another individual whose logistical, philosophical and aesthetic concerns overlap sufficiently with mine to warrant such a close collaboration.

,2541688,Onelegman,"May 30, 2024 at 9:50 AM","Me pasa exactamente lo mismo, tengo pocos lazos afectivos en mi vida, incluso en la familia, pero mamá es lo más sagrado que existe para mi. Verla llorar de dolor cuando le da la ciática hace que quiera quemar el mundo hasta las cenizas.

Realmente, hay pocas formas pacíficas de morir, y de esas pocas solo un par a las que personas normales podamos acceder. Yo mismo hace un mes intenté intoxicarme con nitrógeno, pero por azares del destino, el manorreductor no encajó bien y no me llegó el suficiente (aunque lo hice en el coche sigo pensando que estaría respirándolo igualmente...) fue una decepción enorme, y una cantidad de dinero grande la que gasté para conseguirlo. Buscaba lo mismo, algo que no doliese en absoluto.

Ahora bien, si buscas el ahorcamiento, por lo que he investigado, la suspensión completa suele ser más rápida y efectiva, la parcial conlleva más trabajo, pues debes encontrar dónde están tus venas yugulares y carótidas, con mala suerte hacer ajustes en la cuerda (nudos u objetos) que aprieten en las zonas adecuadas y mucha, mucha práctica, el SI (suvival instinct) es muy perro y desde el segundo 1 va a gritarte que no continúes con algo así. Hay docenas de relatos de gente que lo ha intentado, que vuelven a estar conscientes, fallos y en general, fracasos al llevarlo a cabo. Pero si tienes suerte con tu composición interna podrías hasta conseguirlo al primer intento.

Después esta la completa, el hilo principal está aquí: https://sanctioned-suicide.net/threads/new-full-suspension-megathread.105295/

Esto es bastante más sencillo, la cuerda bien atada a algo que no vaya a desprenderse, el nudo corredizo para el cuello y dejar caer todo tu peso con una cantidad de fuerza moderada. De esta forma se cierran las venas ya comentadas de una forma más rápida según se dice, hecho esto no hay vuelta atrás a menos que tengas opción de agarrarte a algo o volver a posar los pies. Se habla de inconsciencia a los 10 segundos, algo fácil aparentemente verdad? Bueno, si has visto vídeos de este método, notarás que no es tan indoloro, solo tienes que probar la parcial para conocer una pequeña parte de lo que supone la completa. Como digo, yo también lo he contemplado y al final he decidido no hacerlo por la agonía hasta quedar ko. Cuidado con lo de hacerlo cerca, pues las convulsiones pueden hacer que golpees paredes y hagas ruido, lo que causaría que te pudiesen encontrar y rescatar, dependiendo del tiempo que les lleve, puedes terminar con lesiones cerebrales, algunas tan severas que imposibilitarían que pudieses volver a intentar quitarte la vida y ser un vegetal por lo que te quede de existencia. No se me ocurre peor condena que esa.

Lo del nitrito de sodio lo he leído por aquí pero no conozco nada, no se si se respira, ingiere o inyecta, pero un químico tan complejo no debe ser posible obtenerlo sin una licencia, o eso creo, en España. Tampoco conozco la duración hasta el resultado fatal, muchos saben o han experimentado con intoxicación con pastillas y conocen los terribles dolores que se sufren hasta caer muerto, eso si lo consigues, pues el cuerpo al notar la intoxicación, el primer reflejo es el de vomitar, adiós a poder seguir absorbiendo el compuesto tóxico... y la mayoría de veces pueden ser horas con ese dolor. En cuanto a drogas yo pienso que lo mejor sería inyectarse cocaína o heroína de mucha pureza (algo difícil de ver hoy en día) y acabar con sobredosis, pero igual que antes, no sé el tiempo o dolor que puede conllevar algo así.

En mi opinión, si uno de verdad busca CTB, el resultado final de su cuerpo poco debería importarle, uno busca que sea lo más indoloro posible porque el SI va a usar tu cerebro para no llevar a cabo cualquier tipo de lesión, más aún la muerte. Posibles escenarios, fallos, consecuencias, todo para evitar que lo hagas. Así que en definitiva, bien sea con el cuello estirado o sin medio cráneo por un escopetazo, será traumático para quien te encuentre o sepa de tu fallecimiento.

Yo mismo tengo planeado tirarme por la ventana de un 7º piso y me destroza el alma saber que mi madre verá el resultado, sobretodo porque la primera vez ya lo vio. Como dicen mis psicólogos/psiquiatras, es contradictorio no querer que sufra por verme o perderme, y al mismo tiempo buscar hacerle sentir ese dolor, pero llegas a un punto en donde ya todo eso no te importa, tu meta te importa más que los qué dirán o a quien vas a dejar traumatizado por perderte o verte ya sin aliento. Son los mecanismos del cerebro para hacerte recapacitar, hay que ignorarlos todo lo posible, pues no se puede anular el SI. Es violento, es grotesco, pero es rápido e indoloro. Hay que tomar ciertas precauciones, como en cualquier intento, pero sin duda es, después del ahorcamiento, la segunda forma más efectiva, sin contar con las armas de fuego directas al cerebro.

Nadie va a juzgarte. Y a menos que acabes debajo de un tren, si tienes un seguro de decesos, ellos se ocuparán de dejarte lo más presentable posible.
Espero que entiendas que no busco decirte qué uses un método u otro, me he limitado a explicarte lo que sé para que puedas conocer algunos métodos y contemplar pros y contras, la decisión es y siempre será tuya.

¿Qué opinas?

De los métodos que mencionaste el menos abrumador parece ser el de la suspensión completa, claro si se hace de una forma correcta, practicando la parcial más de una vez y con la seguridad de que la inconciencia llegara alrededor de los 10 segundos, al respecto esta publicación https://sanctioned-suicide.net/threads/best-way-to-succeed-partial-hanging-and-overwin-si.130841/ da unas instrucciones muy claras y sencillas de como hacerlo (suspensión parcial). El principal miedo es a fallar y quedar en estado vegetal, un riesgo que se puede mitigar tomando las medidas adecuadas y en general no siendo mediocres.

¿Saltar desde la altura? la verdad nunca he considerado esa opción, el SI de seguro se activara de mil maneras y dar ese paso al abismo me resulta practicamente imposible. Lo unico que se me ocurre para poder consumarlo es estar perdido de ebrio ¿que opinas tu?

En el aspecto del cadaver difiero, lo considero almenos una ultima acción de amor por ellos al dejar un cuerpo entero que puedan despedir de acuerdo a sus creencias religiosas.

Finalmente y ya que mostraste tanto interes en mi mensaje te invito a que sigamos en contacto, la verdad la decisión de hacerlo o no se toma hasta el ultimo segundo, podemos hablar acerca de filosofias como el antinatalimso y la muerte para Heráclito y Schopenhauer.

Quedo atento a tu respuesta",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2543673,Onelegman,"May 31, 2024 at 9:09 PM","With the full suspension what happens to you is what happens to you with jumping from a great height, I don't dare, too many unknowns.

Jumping drunk is not recommended, alcohol relaxes the muscles, and when they are relaxed they absorb impacts better, I learned that here. So, unless it was at least 30 meters high, I wouldn't drink alcohol.

Whether you are a believer or not doesn't matter, but if you really want to not be in a very bad state when your loved ones see you, I understand that you don't want it to be something traumatic.

I have no problem maintaining contact, but are you serious about Schopenhauer? I love to read and certainly I always wanted to read many wise men from ancient times and more contemporary ones, but I don't know the philosophies you mention, if you want to teach me a little, I will gladly read you.

If you see yourself capable of doing the complete or partial suspension, go ahead with it brother. I wish I had that confidence with that method.
Right now I'm researching to be able to buy a gun, if things go well I could remove the SI with a single finger hahaha",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2544730,Sisif,"Jun 1, 2024 at 4:25 PM","Para Heraclito la muerte no nos pertenece, pues cuando ella es nosotros ya no somos. Schopenhauer defiende que la vida es un desagradable episodio que viene a interrumpir la tranquilidad de la nada y el antinatalismo argumenta tanto, como por ejemplo al ser humano como una paradoja biologica, sumamente interesante.

Un arma, tal vez esa seria de las salidas más rapidas e indoloras (o no estoy seguro) ¿que tan fácil puede ser acceder a ella? Saludos",,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe this sort of thing plays a big role in the 25/1 failure/success ratio when it comes to attempting suicide, since most people are not gonna due their due diligence and preplan shit beforehand. This is why it's good to have a method researched and on hand, so that whenever the time comes you'll be ready. Depending on your method, it could take days or even weeks to properly vet, research, acquire necessary products, and plan with a method. I'm sorry that life is beating you down, and I'm sure we can all sympathize with you in some way, but we don't want you to end up worse off because you didn't have a method on hand ready to go.

Is your situation truly dire? Something that requires you to go right now? Or is it possible for you to hold off a bit longer so that you have the time to properly think things through?",2665209,,,,,,,,,,,

But having been there myself and now being out of that state, I can safely say that whatever you're feeling right now is likely going to pale in comparison to attempting suicide in your current state and then failing. Failure is not something you want to add to your plate, as it can vary between additional psychological stress/damage to actual physical damage from being maimed. It'll only make your hell even worse. And being in the state you're in is precisely why you shouldn't act on it right now, in my opinion.

I cannot tell you what to do, as it is your choice and your CTB. All I can do is look from the outside in, and give you information and an opinion. As Aprilfarewell said, you have the right to act as you wish and you may take your exit whenever you feel like it. But this is just my opinion I'm offering, so at the very least you should take into consideration the opinions of people here, it can only help.

I truly wish you well whatever you end up deciding to do.",2665265,,,,,,,,,,,

,2665001,Forever Sleep,"Sep 10, 2024 at 2:17 AM","I know what you mean. The more you do achieve, the more you have to lose. I can remember also feeling fear alongside the very few times I've felt happier in life.

Whether it will be worth it, none of us know. We don't know whether we'll get what we're trying to attain. We don't know whether it will feel worthwhile enough if we do. We don't know whether we'll lose it all ultimately.

I suppose all we do know about is the present moment and perhaps the near future. Would it feel better to stop trying now or would there be some regret in the near future that we'd just given up? I suppose I feel like, so long as there's some hope, there's still some motivation to try.

The other thing is practicalities. Personally, I don't feel like I can kill myself at the moment- I want to wait for my Dad to go first. So for me, that means finding the easiest path through life while I'm stuck here. My creative job has always been pretty much the most important thing in my life. So- while it's full of risk, it's hard work, it can be stressful and it invites in plenty of scope for failure and disappointment, it's still the lesser of the evils for me. So- I pursue it and I do other things I actually hate to ensure I'm fit enough to do it- like exercise. I think it's just making an assessment of our options and going for the one that suits us the best.

As to whether we could fail- sure we could. Any kind of calamity could befall any of us at any moment but- probably better to not worry about stuff that hasn't happened yet. (I'm like that too though. I tend to catastrophize over every possible bad thing that could happen.) If bad stuff does happen, we'll have to deal with it at that moment. I suppose it's more at that point where we'll really decide whether we want to keep fighting or whether we've had enough.

What do I ACTUALLY gain from this? What will I do if I lose it? What if I spend absurd amounts of money trying to heal, only to find out that it was never going to work?

Any other common delusion themes to look out for? Finances getting pulled into a delusion sounds like it could be very ruinous and I'm sorry to hear you've been hurt by these delusions.

,2652666,TAW122,"Aug 31, 2024 at 10:34 AM","In the upcoming event and dreadful month dedicated to CTB prevention (September), I made this thread in response and in advance of such events. These so-called awareness events couldn't be more disingenuous as they ironically seek to destigmatize the stigma associated with the act of CTB itself. As long as the pro-lifers and anti-choicers control the narrative, things will more/less continually remain the same. There is no open and good faith dialogue to be had in such events. Additionally, any normalization or tolerance for special cases for CTB is often censored and ignored, or worse yet, twisted in favor of advancing the anti-choice, pro-life, CTB prevention narrative.

This is why people who are going to CTB would often do so in secrecy, without the chance to say their goodbyes and end up going the DIY means, which leads to an array of complicated consequences for the survivors. The irony is that people complain about the aftermath and collateral damage caused by CTB, yet these preventionists are simply scoping out and profiling would be/prospective suicidal people(s). This in turn, just further alienates those who otherwise would have come out and be honest with their intentions to end up having to hide their intentions for the fear of having their exit or their bus pass/ticket taken away. Some have even taken the brutal bus to exit sentience and all of that would not be necessary if these people are able to come forward without risk of intervention against their freedom and civil liberties. So in a sense, these pro-lifers and anti-choicers can complain about the aftermath, but as long as they never acknowledge that the society and the way the system is set up is the cause of this mess (as well as their actions), these awful buses will simply just continue to persist for the very desperate! Also shaming the desperate does little to help the situation because the desperates' actions are due to a rotten society and the way the anti-choicers and pro-lifers treat them.

Additionally, these groups often try to look for signs and use statistics as well as profiling particular groups for risk assessment and by that, it doesn't really highlight the struggles of what people are going through. In fact, by doing such things such as scoping out potentially suicidal people, they are just seeking to preemptively prevent that act (the act of CTB) rather than trying to fix whatever is causing someone or a particular demographic to want to CTB. For example, they would say ""percentage [percent] of gender [gender] age group[age range from a-b] is at risk of CTB"" and they aren't doing it out of good faith, but it's all an effort to busybody themselves into others' lives and prevent the very act they oppose! These groups do little to nothing to help improve the quality of life or make it where an individual would WANT to enjoy life or at least tolerate life! It's also very invasive and paternalistic, which is of course, no surprise to most of us here. Finally, it's all just grandstanding and empty words, because the moment the one diverges from the narrative or says something that the hive mentality does not agree with, negative consequences come upon said dissident. Thus, these groups aren't looking for an honest, good faith dialogue, they are simply just virtue signaling and finding more ways to impinge on the rights of those who don't enjoy life!

Anyways, I know this isn't new news to most of us on SaSu, but I thought I'd bring this out here to expose the disingenuity of such groups and that their aims isn't to actually destigmatize the act of CTB, despite their euphemistic slogans and wording. Of course, those who are serious about CTB'ing would keep their intentions hidden and groups like these just prove that fact. Though that would not be necessary if such groups would act in good faith, but we know that is not likely to happen anytime soon. In other words, these preventionists want to prevent CTB (that's all they care about!), but fail to acknowledge the real problems of ""why"" people are wanting to CTB the begin with and also fail to rectify such failings of society.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2653002,DeathSleep,"Aug 31, 2024 at 4:28 PM","I agree. Pro-lifers just want you to live and do not care about your reasons, try to understand your reasons or even try to make things better. They're just happy when they feel they've talked someone out of it and played the part of the ""hero"" and then they walk away. They will send you off to a hospital feeling that they did good which does next to nothing for those of us who are chronically suicidal. They want you to live for others and do not care about your circumstances/story.

I wish we lived in a world where people didn't have to CTB in secret if they didn't want to. That others didn't overreact when someone talked about wanting to CTB. Their decision was respected and their reasons were treated as valid. That's not to say the world should do the opposite and be all pro-suicide either.

As a pro-choicer, I do believe that the best outcome is some concessions, but of course, from history, we know pro-lifers/anti-choicers just do not want to even have that. They want to have absolute power and dominance over others' rights and to be able to keep them trapped in suffering, out of mind and out of sight.

,2664152,ijustwishtodie,"Sep 9, 2024 at 1:26 PM","It actually baffles me as to people progress in life. I know I don't have the same skills as them to do the same. Many people are able to go through school, college, university, work etc. Whilst I was able to get through school, college and the first year of university with relative ease, I think that my progress stops here with the second year of university. Don't say that I'm being incorrect about my assessment as I know myself best. This genuinely is it for me.

I'm scared for the future because I know that I don't have it in me to continue through life. If I stay alive, things will get substantially worse as I'll fail my university course and subsequently get abused by family for it. Just to clarify, this isn't only about university, it's about everything ahead of me from now. The thing with life is that the amount of hardship and effort required from the average human increases the more we age because that's how humanity's arbitrary system operates like.

I'm scared and I can't get rid of the panic attacks that I'm getting when thinking about the future. I was never meant to be a human. In fact, I never even wanted to go through school or college or university. I have no passions in anything and I've always wanted to be lazy. I have been lazy so far with no consequences but being lazy from now on will punish me tremendously and I hate that.

I don't get why people assume that everybody is meant for life. It's obvious that isn't the case and it's obvious that I'm not one of them due to my neurotype. Either way, even if I could progress through life, I don't want to since life isn't worth the effort.

I just wish that there was a way to ease my pain. The only way I know of is death but I'm too scared to kill myself via a brutal suicide method and I also don't have many opportunities to kill myself either",,,,,,,,,,,,

Living with a mother with severe emotional trauma (vivd, horrible nightmares almost every night) and a father who was emotionally distant was hard. What was worse was the physical and emotional abuse that my brother heaped on me.

You stated that if you quit school, your family will abuse you. I assume that means that they will treat you poorly. It really sounds like you've been through a lot, but from what I can gather, you are still fairly young. I struggled for years. I bombed out of 2 high schools and had to get a GED. I was unable to find a job because I didn't believe in myself. It took a long time and the death of first my father, and then, my mother for me to move forward. I spent over 12 years in therapy. I was able to find a good Psychologist. She was the one who diagnosed me with CPTSD. I made slow but steady progress, and actually got to the recovery phase(thank you covid for ruining that). It really sounds like you are living in a toxic enviroment. Living in a toxic family is the emotional equivilant of living near a toxic waste site. It messes with you head.
I would strongly advise you to reach out to a therapist or a school counselor. When we are living with trauma and depression, we don't see ourselves as others (not including your family) see us.

I'm not living in a toxic environment. My parents aren't being toxic or cruel; they're just doing exactly what society is telling them to do. They don't have any malice and they truly do want the best for me but the issue is that normies can't understand that I don't want life itself. My parents are massive NPC normies. What is cruel is society forcing me to do things that I don't want to do.

Also, please don't give me any advice, I don't like it. If I wanted advice and help, I'd be posting in the recovery section, not here. I'm here to get away from any advice that's pro life. I don't care about how my family sees me; I only care about how I'm forced to do stuff that I don't want to do.
Omg I relate to you so much. Seeing your words slightly put me at ease as I always felt like I was the only one in life who never really had any passions with anything. In fact, for a very long time, I didn't even understand that I didn't have any passions at all as the only thing I saw around me were people who enjoyed something. Even suicidal people seemed to enjoy something whether that be music or TV shows or whatever. However, I'm an exception. I only really do things relating to escapism to pass the time, not because I enjoy doing it. I only understood myself more once I started using this site as few people here (not many but a few) are similar to me. In my case, I'm naturally lazy and I'm depressed because I can't be lazy.

I don't know why pro lifers can't acknowledge that some of us clearly aren't meant for life. It baffles me. There are 8 billion people so statistically there must be some people who aren't meant for life or those who enjoy nothing at all regarding life",2664912,2664972,2665145,,,,,,,,,

Should I sign for the package/mail if asked to?
Depends on your jurisdiction. Some require it as a prerequisite to police action, others don't.


Yet, if a CD (controlled delivery) is in place to happen, you're going to get arrested. Maybe not at that point in time if you refuse to sign, but it will happen. If they have made the decision to CD you, they aren't gonna let you off the hook if you refuse to sign. Not signing will suspicious too.


Also, signing for a package doesn't make you guilty. Its the courts job to prove that you asked for the package, and signing for a package does not prove this.


The only reason postal services have you sign is to say that you received the package, and that they have done their job. It's a standard practice, especially for international mail and deliveries.


So why are there so many people on the ""don't Sign"" boat? Not signing make you feel like you have a say in the most dangerous part of the darknet process. People are paranoid and anxious, and want a say in what's happening around them. Once the package is out however, there is little any person can do against any LEO (Law Enforcement Officer) intervention.


What is a Controlled Delivery?

This is an attempt to accept a package containing drugs to obtain a solid reason for a search of your home to be conducted. They get you to accept the package and they believe that this is reasonable cause to believe you ordered the package and knew it was coming. Just because a package requires a signature does not mean it is in anyway a CD.

How do people get CD'ed?

This can happen in many ways. They may order a bulk amount of product from abroad. LE may have noticed an influx of packages from the same person and inspect one and profile you for a while. You are more likely to get CD'ed when ordering large amounts from another country. Domestic packages of a smaller quantity are very unlikely to get caught, and if its a personal amount, you will more likely get a love letter and that will be the end of it. They may start monitoring your mail.

tl;dr I wouldn't worry about it. Seems like the best option is to just sign it.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I had intense ideation in April/May and was certain I was going to ctb this year, but then I felt so guilty because it was both my parents' and my sister's birthdays in May and I didn't want to ruin that time for them. I also felt guilty for whatever possible sadness they might feel. So, I decided to check myself into a psych unit instead. I felt exactly one month of relief and then the ideation came back, so here I am again, BUT this time I'm positive ctb is the way forward. I'm much calmer about my decision (I mean it's been 20 years of BPD mixed with addiction and ideation, I'm 34/F btw), and five months of proper planning, and my decision is not making me anxious anymore. And I guess, that's all I want to say, this time around I'm at peace with my decision to ctb. I don't cry about it anymore, I know that it's the only way I'll get lasting peace. I'm also sure it's not my condition talking, since my new meds have me pretty balanced.

I have a method (SN), range of time (I'm not setting a definite date, trying to mind trick myself into not chickening out), and a to-do checklist, and most importantly a clear head.

So, yes. If ctb is making you extremely anxious and you doubt your decision, think it through first, sit with it for a while. Being at peace with your decision will also help you think clearly of everything you need to do and prepare to successfully ctb.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I wonder if everyone experiences this just before death? Excluding traumatic injury type deaths of course.

I think it must be when the body/mind finally comes to an acceptance because it knows there is no fighting it anymore. Like how very old people will just stop eating and the body knows to shut down. Quite fascinating when you consider it's so innate to try and escape death in all other circumstances. The people that ended up being saved just in time now seem to not be scared of death at all.

Lately I've been feeling very anxious at the thought of having to do it right away due to personal circumstances and it isn't helping at all. Even though I know this is the way I should go there still comes ''hopeful feelings'' that I shouldn't be having. This happens because I know good surprises come and go in life. They really happen, even if there are also the downs. But I didn't earn the right to be here in this world because I don't fit in anywhere so maybe I shouldn't feel entitled to live ''these experiences''.

I desperately need to find a way to be at peace with the decision, but it's not easy. It feels like the more pressure you feel by circumstances the harder it gets to go through with feeling peace. I feel I don't have the time to properly prepare but at the same time if I don't it's gonna spoil everything. I just know SI will kick in hard if I try to ctb with these feelings of uneasiness. I'm gonna try to sit with the idea each day as much as possible in order to find some peace, but not just through vague thoughts like I did in the past 10 years since it's unproductive, I have to take action, write everything down, buy the kit. But even getting rid of things is so difficult for me, almost unfathomable, and buying the kit gets me anxious too. My brain gets fried just at the thought of it.

I'm very confused and don't know what to do. Before I used to think ctb was much easier, ''just go with it''. Turns out it is not like this at all! When you give the idea the logic/reasonable approach rather than dealing with it emotionally you realize there needs to be careful preparation and it is indeed the most difficult thing anyone can ever do. I admire people who are able to do it so much, especially the ones who do it on a whim (of course it can be done, but I think they are a minority).

If you think of life too objectively, you're going to run into a million ""what if I'm not good enough?"" thoughts. Someone will always be better, especially if your pursuit is material in nature, and that's okay. Every goal you could ever have in life requires a personal journey and you can't give up because you're just one of the many.

You're not just some cog in the machine. You're a thinking, feeling person who probably has 10x the depth of a billionaire. Do something that makes you happy, and find someone that makes you happy to do it with. And fuck money.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Are we all truly useless or do I really have no purpose?,2612824,Forever Sleep,"Jul 29, 2024 at 1:27 AM","I think I've gotten to a stage where I'm sick and tired of trying to be made to feel guilty by parents and family members. I don't think they necessarily do it intentionally. Rather, I think it's what they grew up with so, they're just repeating the pattern. And I suppose they accepted it so, they expect me to as well. I just don't feel willing to anymore though.

I mean- in physical reality I do. I work my arse off to support myself. I'm also currently doing the creative 'career' I trained in. Still- it isn't financially very sound at all. So- that obviously concerns my parents.

I also pretty much invite criticism by telling them what I'm worried about and where I'm failing. I find people tend to try and find solutions to problems (with good intentions of course) but that tends to fall within criticism of what you're currently doing- find a better paid job, become more efficient at it, ask for more money. Ultimately though, I think they'd be fine with me wage slaving again if it meant there was less risk of me failing financially and needing their help. Because- as I've been told numerous times- they hated their job too.

I suppose that's what I think it comes down to ultimately. Of course parents would like to see their children happy. They'd love to proudly boast that they fulfilled their dreams and are now some famous athlete, musician, writer, scientist- whatever. But, the world doesn't always reward us for working hard. So many of us will simply have to settle for jobs we didn't train in. That aren't really to do with what really interests us. Maybe jobs that we utterly hate!

And, our parents likely knew that was the reality. They likely went through the same thing themselves. I simply don't think it's fair to do that to someone. Bring them into this world to effectively be another slave to capitalism with the tinniest chance that they may actually be able to feel fulfilled through their work.

So, I've gotten to a stage where my long embedded guilt has turned into antinatilist resentment. Basically put- none of this is my fault. I think it's unreasonable to bring a sentient being here and expect it to perform brilliantly and not become a burden on you. Or, to treat it like a physical insurance where- you hope it will physically meet all your needs because you did the same when it was an infant. I just don't think it's fair to do that to someone.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm 61 now and I spent 60 years just surviving successive hardships and traumas so I didn't have time to think about it (altho I did o/d in my 20's and wanted to ctb when I was about 10). Then I had a breakdown last year and am trying to recover. But there is no purpose to my life. I have no self esteem with good reason because although I really want to help others, people don't take to me because I'm superficial, boring, fat and ugly and every time I try to help someone it goes wrong and makes everything worse. So in my fantasy land I have a purpose in helping other people but in real life I'm stupid, rejected, with no friends, partner or career, and not much prospect of that changing. And I'm regularly reminded of the truth, despite trying to avoid people. I'm being helped by a new psych nurse at the moment so I'll do what he says and try my best, but in my clearer moments I know the truth and I know the eventual outcome. I have a ctb drawer with various stuff I'll need, and I've just ordered SN. I'll post on here if nothing changes and the decision is made for me.

Dying itself though- depends. Some people probably know very little about it- if they are lucky enough to go in their sleep or under heavy pain killers. I imagine that's like aneasthetic- if they are even awake, one moment they're here, the next they're gone.

I have a horrible feeling it can be distressful though. If we're feeling pain and fear. I doubt many suicides- asides from those using the proper drugs like N are all that peaceful. Again, probably comes down to luck and preparation. How long we're stuck here trying to die and what's happening to our body.

The actual moment of death or at least, losing consciousness I imagine will be like going under anaesthetic or falling asleep. I sort of doubt it's anything prolonged but then, who knows?

There was an unfortunate patient who happened to die whilst they were having a brain scan I read about once. The areas of the brain associated with memory apparently lit up- which would support people claiming their life flashed before their eyes. Maybe the brain is flooded with all sorts of chemicals we don't get day to day. That in my unlearned opinion could be a reason for things like NDE's.

Death is non-existence forever : all problems solved instantly and forever. no chance of pain , suffering , diseases , problems , bad memories , diseaes ,old age , none of the 1000's of horrible things in life ever getting you .

While dying u are still alive so that has nothing to do with Death. In Death there can be no pain

if a gang is torturing a human like they tortured Junko Furuta ripping skin off fingers etc. they are suffreing dying . but if the human suddendly dies from one of the blows then that human is a corpse. they can continue to cut the corpse but it will feel no pain. That's the difference while dying torture cause still alive . While Dead no pain ever.

dying can be unbearable painful as in cancer , dementia and can take years of constant pain or it can be quick 3-5 minutes go to sleep as in Nembutal. But there is a big difference between dying and Death. while dying you are still alive and so can suffer unending constant unbearable pain. some people have suffered many years with alsheimers for example. . Dying can also be 1 micro-seconds as in a shotgun blast to the head. you go instantly unconscious after pulling the trigger. years in cancer pain vs 1 micro-second no pain. i'd take the shotgun. humans have a 40% chance of cancer in their lifetime and that is just one hell. cancer is unstoppable. no one knows that a human is really 30 trillion cells and each one of those is constantly copying DNA and duplicating . the machinery evolved to be very efficient but still the law of Entropy will always win and there will be mistakes in all this copying and that leads to cancer. The law of Entropy can never be overcome


we all will die anyway . so we are all dying , all decaying , we are all terminal . so it's the utlimate hypocrasy that the evil controllers tell us that they will allow us suicide only if you have a terminal illness which they arbitraliy define as being 6 months diagonosis by one their experts which are sometimes wrong on the exact date of Death. This they allow only in a few places . but we are all terminal 6 months to Death doesn't change that you will die anyway no matter what .

For the past 4 years at the time, this man was all I knew. He was the most loving, caring, thoughtful person. G healed parts of me that I never thought would heal. He helped me believe in love. He showed me it was real. I am coming up on my 4th year without him, this October. I decided when I lost him,I did not want to be here anymore. I am now patiently waiting for a painless method to make itself known and I'm gone. I need to be reunited with him. Not only him but our child as well. I miscarried our baby at 21 due to stress of losing my younger cousin to suicide when he was only 11. I've suffered so much loss but losing G, that was the nail in my coffin. He took me with him when he left. I'm a shell of who I was and I'm tired of pretending for friends and family that I'm okay because I'm not and haven't been for a while. The only time I'm ""okay"" is when I'm ignoring my pain and hurt in my heart but every night, I have to face reality. He's gone, he's not coming back and his life was cut too short. I'll never hear his laugh again, see him smile, have a family with him. Grow old with him. He was taken way too soon and since he didn't get to make it past 28, I don't want to either. There's no words to describe the pain. I truly believe G was my soulmate which is why I feel so lost now. I've tried counseling but it only seems to be a bandaid for the pain I feel. Reality still hits, that he's gone and no matter what I do, he's not coming back. I tried to ctb last year on my birthday by inhaling helium and I passed out but sadly awoke as if I had just fallen asleep. I think I want to settle with this as my method. I just need to get it right. If anyone has any suggestions, feel free to let me know. Even if it's another method. Here's to hoping my next life is more kind to me than this one has been.

I do not want to specify names or give addresses or exact data so that the method is not lost. The other chain of veterinary pharmacies does sell N with the sole presentation of a medical prescription. In my case I was able to get a fake medical prescription with a stamp.

In Arequipa it is also possible to get N. I traveled to that city and I must say that there is less control. It is available in agro-veterinary stores, those in the Arequipa area do not ask for so many requirements.

Context: i have taken field first aid classes as a requirement from school and am familiar with hypovolemic shock and the resulting symptoms. im asking because i was getting blood taken one day (about a year ago) and they accidentally took too much because i was not drinking water and was generally unhealthy then, but it was such a gradual decrease in consciousness that i have considered today as a possible method.

plenty of things have that warning, but don't have great odds of killing you and usually just cause you a ton of suffering. rule of thumb is, if you don't know how much you have to ingest, what effects you'll experience, the odds of a fatal outcome, aftermath of a failure, then i'd say no. there are much better methods out there with actual in-depth info and numerous success stories. some methods are tried and true for thousands of years like hanging, others are relatively new like SN. but they both have plenty of info to research and that's key in making a informed decision.

A good rule of thumb is that if it isn't listed there, you haven't heard of it/there's no success story with it, or the tools to do it are fairly straightforward to acquire, then there's a pretty good chance that it's a bad method.

"1 year for a better life? or CTB? If you had the option between CTB and getting your life together, which would you choose?",2658333,Kassiee,"Sep 4, 2024 at 8:31 PM","If you were in a position where you wanted to CTB, but had the option to get your life somewhat together, would you take it?

The downside to this process is that it takes time, effort, and patience maybe around 5 to 7 months, or even up to a year. It will require energy and perseverance.

The upside, though, is that after going through it, you'll feel better not just slightly or significantly, but simply better than when you were considering CTB. In short, you'll be fairly happy, enjoy life more, and feel like you finally have a reason to live.

Or, you could choose to CTB and not have to worry about any of this just cease to exist in peace. But keep in mind, if you put in the effort over the next year, you'll likely feel much better than you do now.

So, long story short: which would you choose?",,,,,,,,,,,,

The thing is that I'm mostly convinced that if I truly did commit myself to applying effort and persevering through my lack of desire and will everyday, then I really would be able to turn my life into something worth experiencing. I thought this plan would work given the initially intense fear-factor of promising to kill myself if I didn't achieve success, but I somehow managed to remain the way that I've always been despite the new motivation. I still get the fleeting hopeful thoughts and daydreams but they've become much less frequent and believable.

Honestly though, I'm sure this kind of plan has helped a lot of people and works to a degree. I've always had trouble with being sure of how I felt which extends towards whether or not I'd truly want to get my life together and be happy, so maybe I just need to come to terms with what kind of person I really am lol.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Would it work if i just complain about nausea and headaches to a doctor, and mention that someone i know got help to a similar issue from metoclopramide? I think this is how it was advised.

But since i am young and reasonably healthy, i am worried they will want to run all kinds of tests first, which of course i don't want. If they find nothing, they will be puzzled why i still claim to have nausea and headaches. What if they see my old psych diagnoses and just assume it's some mental thing?

The bottle it is in is already opened, its cap is like a standard water bottle so has a ring that you need to break the cap away from to turn it. This is already broken. But I wonder if this is just cause its a custom fill?

There is no label per se, just a small sticker saying ""toner"". It was from a chem company in China and they said they would label it something different to make it easier. I didnt ask them to do this but they suggested they would. Is this suspicious not having a printed label?

Is it a concern to the quality to be in a capped bottle with cap able to be opened already? Or could customs have opened it?

I will test it using Water Works nitrite/nitrate strips. These are to 10mg/L nitrite and 50mg/L nitrate. The chem co emailed me a CoA that says it should be 99%. So assume that means it should be all nitrite (i.e. have no nitrate or anything else for that matter in it?). So nitrate colour reading should be white/clear.

I should be getting some different test kits tomorrow to test again and see what results they give. They also sold as 99% pure and was expensive to get shipped. I saw that there were other suppliers there that might ship for cheaper. But I don't know if they are really different suppliers or not.

The new test strips felt worthless. All show nitrate as far as I can tell.

I'm not sure on opening the samples. There was a thread that I read saying that it lasted a surprisingly long time after opened if you kept it in the right conditions. But I have no experience with that myself and wouldn't know for sure.

Is the propranolol for anxiety? I don't have that. Wasn't planning on it.

For an AE I have domperidone already for legitimate reasons. I was going to be prescribed meto but the pharmacy said it would have a severe reaction with one of my other meds so they switched it. I take 15-18 pills a day depending on the day. Plus some pain meds of some days. It just happened that the last med that got prescribed was the AE. But for stomach emptying purposes.

I have ""start conversation"" available now. Is that the forum's version of PMs?

Work is seasonal and part time. But they happen to like me and work with my health problems.

Like the test strips showed high amounts of nitrate and the concentrations of nitrate and nitrite combined were higher that the amount of powder that was supposed to be in there. I got some different test strips and tested again and again got confusing results.

I just did another test again with one of the chemical test kits. But I'm having difficulty telling the shades apart now. So I'm posting here to see what people think the purity is. Or at least if it looks like it's enough to do the job.

I tested a drop of blood with one grain of the SN and it all turned dark in about 5 or so seconds. But it wasn't much blood, just what you use for the diabetic test strips.

The SN also came in a bottle that was already opened and half full. The cap was on tightly but the seal was obviously broken that it had been opened.

Here's the results from the chemical kit. Following the guide it's supposed to be 5mg/L of SN and it was sold as 99% pure. I can't tell if the nitrite is 2 or 5 mg/L and it looks to me like the nitrate is around 10mg/L. Totalling 12-15mg.L for both. But if the guide is accurate there should only be 5mg/L total.

You're grieving. You're depressed. You've lost a child to suicide. As a parent myself, I can possibly sympathise with how that would feel - but I still can't fully understand. I do know it would hurt like nothing else.

I don't think you're getting enough support. How you're feeling now, how shit your entire world is, is normal for someone in your situation. It's ok to feel like you do at the moment.

Please get more real life support - you're now feeling like your son probably did, just before he took his life. You keep asking what could you have done differently to support him. Well, with kindness, you need to turn that in on yourself. What more can be done for yourself? You work at a hospital, is there a clinical lead or support team that can help you?

I wouldn't normally be this pushy, but your suicidal ideation is very specific to losing your son. From what I've seen you post, it's not a long term illness or thought process that you've carried with you. It is something that you can get more support and help for.

I know there's plenty of people here that tried partial suspension hanging and didn't get the desired results.

Well, everyone fails because they forget to hold their breath. This is actually very important because if you don't do that, you will just start hyperventilating in an attempt to feel your brain oxygen.

A simple experiment for you all: tie a slip knot (noose knot) on a rope or, what I used, a bathrobe belt. Put it around your neck as high up as possible, just below the chin. Tighten the rope, making sure that the know is perfectly behind your neck. Exhale fully and take a deep breath and hold it. Then immediately pull the rope upwards, above your head with one hand, and pinch your nose with the other hand while keeping your lips closed.
If done right, you should start to spasm. This could also lead to very, very brief loss of consciousness, however I don't have any evidence of that since I had nobody to verify that for me.
Try this while standing up if you don't believe me.

Although I'm not keen on partial hanging (I prefer full suspension hanging), I believe this is an important finding and so I decided to share it with this community.

Let me know your thoughts :)",,,,,,,,,,,,

Now that I think about it, I'm not sure if this will definitely help in a partial suspension hanging attempt. I posted this as a little experiment of how it should go, ideally. Because you're not putting enough pressure, you can still breathe from your airway (this doesn't happen if you were to do full suspension hanging).

Anyway, hope you make good use of this knowledge and if you find any new insight on partial suspension hanging, please share with us. All the best to you :)",2623081,,,,,,,,,,,

On the otherhand if you crouch on a stool with the noose on already - it might work",2620351,,,,,,,,,,,
,2626510,Gustav Hartmann,"Aug 10, 2024 at 9:34 AM","When I was hanging I never payed attention to my breath, I didn´d even realise that I am not able to breathe. Unconscousness comes within 5 to 15 second and this is long bevore the urge to breathe starts.

In my opinion partial hanging is less succesfull (in therms of death) than full hanging for the following reasons:

1. The pressure to the neck is not defined, it depends on how you sit, hang or lie. This makes it difficult to pass out and you may get an exploding head feeling. Full suspension effects more than enaugh pressure and you cannot reduce this pressure intentionally.

2. You can stop suspension hanging as long as you are conscious and it needs a strong will not to stand up when you feel unconsciousness coming. I tried full hanging by lifting my feet off the ground und it was very hard to keep my feet up when I started to feel dizzy.

3. Even when you black out you can free yourself in a state of semi-consciousness. A friend of me hanged himself partial, passed out and found himself lying on the ground. He was obviously moving so violently that his neckmuscles were severe injured.

I guess many people who choose partial because they want to reduce the force to neck, but no pain no gain.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2630228,Evelyn Lane,"Aug 13, 2024 at 10:26 AM","I want to post an update about this. I forgot to mention that when you're doing partial suspension hanging if you feel like your head is about to explode and feel pressure behind the eyes, it means you're not applying enough pressure on the noose.
Also, I want to say that when you do partial suspension hanging you will notice that you start breathing louder and louder: the louder you breathe, the better you've compressed your carotid arteries. Enduring this air hunger is uncomfortable (one of the reasons why I prefer full suspension hanging instead). Partial suspension hanging is therefore a very loud and noisy method and not at all quiet (unless you can miraculously hold your breath all the way through).

I don't know what happens if you can endure this air hunger, if you will pass out from this or not, because I haven't had the opportunity to test this out. If anyone has experience with this and managed to pass out from this, you're welcome to share your findings.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2665059,Madison98,"Sep 10, 2024 at 4:26 AM","I'll keep it simple. I'm a survivor of child sexual assault. Got molested repeatedly by a neighbour between the ages of 5-8. I have CPTSD but not just from that, school was a horrible place for me. I am on the spectrum and at the time teachers didn't know how to deal with someone like me so instead of changing the environment to cater for me they abused me, in an attempt to help me adapt to the environment I was in. Yes I agree this helped me some as I am very high functioning now as a 27 year old but I developed horrendous social anxiety and severe depression from a very young age, I am confident these manifested as a result of this trauma. I live now not remembering a day without anxiety or depression.

Even worse still I always knew I was transgender. I remember when I was as young as six I used to pray to god each night hoping that I wake up as a girl. This of course never became true and since I feared social judgement from such a young age, I never came out or received gender affirming treatment before my male puberty really kicked in. So now, even though I have come out I will most likely never have the body of a women. Maybe surgeries will help but the chances that I'll ever pass are uncertain.

I don't have any identity, I've spent my whole young adult life desperately searching for some kind of meaning, to have something to cling onto and give me motivation to live. And even with two daughters with whom I love very much, I'm still losing the will to live.

I'm not sure how much strength I have left to keep on with my transition, apart of me wants to wait and see what happens and maybe I will be surprise and find a life worth living on the other side. The problem is I'm so god damn tired now. Referencing Tolkien's work.. ""I feel like butter spread over too much bread"". And every day that goes by the sweat call of all this ending is enveloping me. It's almost like I'm already dead and my soul is halfway out but my body still clinging on to life reminding me of what I will never be.

What triggers me the most is seeing photos of children playing, young adults hanging out, at parties ect. I spent most of my childhood scared of the world so I never went out and experienced living. Seeing those photos are heavy reminder of what I never had.

My life can be understood as a building halfway through construction but the foundations weren't correctly laid. As time moves forward and the weight of life starts to push down on those foundations everything inevitably comes crashing down. Even if I become a women, I'll be a women that never had a childhood as a girl. An identity missing its core.

I'm ordering SN, I have found a source. Hopefully it gets through customs without getting flagged. I don't think I could deal with a welfare check. It will just end with me going to hospital again and that never helps.

For those who have taken the time to read this, thank you for hearing my truth. You're the only ones I trust with this before the end.

There really is no solution to this problem other than standing up and taking action. If you really think it's already too late then sign out of university — will this grand you a refund on your university tuition, and what do you want to do next? But if you'd rather want to stay then there must be a part of you that still thinks it's not too late, which brings us back to standing up and taking action. I know this is easier said then done. And I'm in no position to speak on this because I was in the same position, and failed. But I hope you can come out of this downward spiral.

Normally I don't come with advice on venting threads because as the flair suggests: it's to vent, not to discus or solve problems. But since you wrote that you want to reach out for help, please consider these tips. They helped me at times. Ignore this if it's unwelcome.
Are you familiar with the feeling of relaxing in your bed after you woke up, not wanting to leave your comfortable bed when suddenly, you feel a burst of energy coming from within you? This energy feels similar to the rush of adrenaline you get from hearing about a big assignment from your friends and discovering that the deadline is only 1 hour away, having yet to start. Sometimes, when I don't want to get ouf of bed, I wait for a sign as an excuse to stay longer under my comfortable duvet. Then, after a bit of time, as if I'm building up the energy to get out of bed, I suddenly feel energy rushing within me, the sign I've been waiting for. If you're familiar with this experience then use this rush of energy to get out of bed.
In my experience, my home/room is where I start to spiral down. I'm active and lively when I'm out or with other people, including at uni. But once I'm back home, I see my bed and just want to drop myself like a brick. I want to stop responding to people, ignore everything that goes on around me and just be nothing, think nothing, feel nothing. My solution to this problem was to do everything that needed to be done at the uni, and go home only after I'm done.
You're suppose to be starting university soon, but do you want to start? Or to rephase it, do you plan on starting university because it's a necessary part/step to reach your dream job/life, or because it's expected of you to start uni (family or societal norms)? In case of the former, I hope your dream will motivate you to push yourself. In case of the latter, I hope you'll find what makes you happy, not what makes others happy for you.

,2633146,Evelyn Lane,"Aug 15, 2024 at 3:29 PM","I believe that people that come to the conclusion of hanging themselves full suspension have a phase in which they are into partial suspension, desperately trying to get it to work. So I decided to create a collection of successful partial suspension hanging attempts in video format, for research purposes. This should be useful to all aspiring partial suspension hangers. Obviously, these days I advise against partial suspension hanging, but I am aware that not everyone is ready for full suspension hanging yet, since they haven't yet felt the frustration that comes from not getting partial suspension hanging to work.

1) He used some kind of cable didn't he? I've tried that too but it felt very uncomfortable. He seems to have passed out very quickly though. His face turned blue almost immediately

2) Looks very painful and uncomfortable. And he was found after only a few minutes. Does anyone know if he succeeded?

3) I always wonder how these fans can hold the weight of people. Especially if there's so much movement like in this video. Also the material he used didn't seem good

4) is extremely scary. He seemed unable to find a proper position. Looking at his face he was in pain.

5) She obviously did it in public (railroad noises?) and at daylight. I would be scared of the danger of being found. Looks like she was seeking the attention

6) Hanging at the window so everybody coming by can see it? No way I would do it that way

7) Suicide or autoerotic accident?

9) I doubt he made it before he was found in the middle of the street.

10) Looks ugly. What's that stuff running out of his nose?

11) Well done, quickly and relatively painless as it looks like",,,,,,,,,,,,

Imo it's not comparable to N or euthanasia. But its better than SN, if one has the ability and place to prepare.

,2653025,thislife24,"Aug 31, 2024 at 4:58 PM","After being in a nearly 10 year relationship, it has been broken. I thought she was my soulmate, my other half, my best friend. We had been through so much together, I thought our relationship was unbreakable. But alas, maybe we were never meant to be. I have many struggles that I deal with in day-to-day life. I have a soul crushing autoimmune condition that causes great pain in my joints, and went many years without treatment because no one believed me, even myself at times. This caused great isolation and sadness, which exacerbated my anxiety and PTSD. I found out not long ago that I have a personality disorder called Avoidant Personality Disorder, which can be seen as an extreme form of social anxiety disorder. The depressing thing is that personality disorders can not be cured, only treated. Early child hood experiences, as well as my genetic disposition probably contributed to the onset of this disorder.

Despite these huge barriers I was dealt with, I was able to finally get a job after 6 years of being unemployed. I did okay for a bit while working, but it eventually caught up to me and my physical and mental health started to decline. Even though I was struggling, I stuck through it to help out in my relationship. Emotionally I began to isolate myself due to the overwhelming pain and stress due to my job and life in general. At the end of the day, I wasn't thriving and contributing a whole lot to my relationship which also caused the deterioration of it. My partner herself had a great career and social life. She was thriving while I wasn't, doing the best that I could just to get by day-to-day. I think she started to feel trapped and unloved in the relationship, which also started to affect her mental health and well-being. That and not feeling loved was a big contributor to the dissolution of our relationship. Due to the bad coping mechanisms I developed in my childhood in conjunction with my personality disorder, I began to avoid everything in life. I avoided important responsibilities and things I needed to due as an adult. This was probably the straw the broke the camels back.

She left me, and now I am all alone. I have no one I can fall back on. I ended up just not showing up at my job after the breakup, because fuck it. It is nearly impossible to get on disability, and I've looked into section 8 housing where I live, but there's a huge wait list that you can't even get on at this point. I am pretty much fucked. I am tired of dealing with the soul crushing physical pain that waxes and wanes day to day, and the emotional pain at this point is unbearable. She was the one for me, my best friend, my support and my everything. The fact that I was just discarded so easily after we had been together for so long and shared everything has sent shock waves to the very core of my being. Since the breakup, I've had many friends and family reach out to me making sure I was okay and not going to do something irrational. I play it off as I am okay, but obviously I am not. I would hate do take myself out of this world, as it would be completely devastating to my family and friends. I would also hate to burden my ex the rest of her life, making her think she was the reason that I CTB. I am on the verge of being homeless, and barely have any food to eat at this point.

At this point, I feel as if I am lost at sea with no navigational abilities and just waiting for this ship to sink.",,,,,,,,,,,,

For what it's worth, homeless shelters usually have some kind of social program to help you get housing and disability. I'm surprised you haven't been approved for SSDI, but I assure you, it's not much.

I've been on disability for about a decade, and it's really a struggle. If you're in a city, find housing for the disabled that will work with you on finances

,2664806,hell toupee,"Sep 9, 2024 at 9:40 PM","Hey friend,

I registered here just to reply to you.

Exactly one month ago I found my wife of 24 years hanging by an extension cord.

About a year earlier, I started to notice my fingers contracting (contracture) and I started losing my balance going to work (I am the sole proprietor of a tax business and own my own office). Then I started to fall. My wife got scared and ordered me a wheelchair around Jan of last year. Given I worked 7 days a week just to keep up with tax season and my reduced work pace due to my fingers curling in. I could not take any time off because of the demand of tax season. I also didn't have any insurance.

My wife became my caretaker helping me in and out of wheelchair, car, down our steps, etc. My fingers got worse I couldn't even open a soda can, the strength in my wrists disappeared.

Fast forward to Aug 8. I found my wife dangling lifeless. Neither of us had any friends or family. It was us against the world. We were each other's best friend. We could amuse ourselves watching paint dry. It was a picture perfect marriage, she was a homemaker and I worked. Every day, even after 24 years, she would include a little note in my lunch she would pack for me - 'you are the best husband in the world' ... 'I am the luckiest girl in the world' ... 'when the universe began we would be holding hands and when the universe ends we will still be holding hands' ... 'we are going to be that old couple in the park still holding hands'. Everyday. She would randomly call me at work 'I miss you, can't wait until you get home'. And I the same.

After I found her, I went to the ER not knowing what to do without a soul in the world I could call. Plus this weird stuff with my fingers and being wheelchair bound.

After running every test known to man, they discharged me after 24 days, not knowing what caused it, but that I had irreversible nerve damage in my fingers and my toes. I would be confined to a wheelchair for the rest of my life. I could use a ""slide board"" to get from my wheelchair to the couch, or bed, or toilet, or car seat, but I couldn't drive or use my hands much. I can do most things, it just takes me longer.

I was discharged facing a life of being crippled, have about $5k to my name, nowhere to go as I was only able to pay rent until Oct 1st, and nobody to call for help. I have no ability to ever earn an income again. I live in San Diego where a studio goes for $2k a month. And I have nobody to live for. My wife, partner, soulmate, is gone.

I have not a single person in the world I could call for help. I am not going to a nursing home and living in a room with 3 other people. My dad was in one and it was the single most depressive atmosphere I had ever experienced. People moaning all day and night, sitting in their own excrement for 2 hours waiting for the nurse to come.

The thought of spending the rest of my life trying to eek out an existence of subsistence on disability, which in San Diego's rental market would be impossible, laying in bed watching TV all day does not appeal to me. I used to surf, play guitar and drums, ride my crotch rocket down the freeway at 120mph on a wheelie for miles.

I'm not afraid to die. I believe that death is just a change of wardrobe. A new beginning. Not religious, but spiritual. All I can think about as I lie awake all night is my wife's smile, her laugh, and the fact I'll never see her or talk to her again. She didn't leave a note, no warning, no depression, nothing. I can't help but think maybe she didn't think we had a future with her now all of a sudden my caretaker and the fact we'd never own a home in SD. I barely made enough to pay our bills, but we could pretty much buy whatever we wanted at the store or whatever. We weren't on a budget but it was never enough for a new car or something.

I cannot survive here and even if I could everything I do just reminds me of her. We probably spent more time together than people married for twice as long as us. She was the kind of person, knowing that we had a few neighbors that were senior citizens and widowed, when she cooked me a plate of dinner she would make a plate for our neighbors and go knock on their doors. She was a kind and sweet soul and I miss her dearly. I just want to exit this cruel world and be happy with her again.

I feel your pain, friend. I really do.",2653025,,,,,,,,,,,

It sounds like you and your wife had an amazing marriage. Those notes she would leave you are so sweet. I can barely think of many marriages that I know of that were that loving and sweet. I'm so so sorry to hear that she has passed.

I can't even imagine how that must have been for you. I can't imagine how it must be now. Life can throw us massive curveballs at times and can be truly unfair. It sounds like she loved you so much though, just as you have loved her.

My girlfriend was also my caretaker for many years. I know it definitely was hard on her at times. I've also looked into disability and other services as you have mentioned, and it seems impossible to get. Even if you do get it, it's mostly below poverty wages. If my disease gets worse, I definitely don't want to spend my life at a nursery home either.

Having a disease can suck so damn much, I'm so sorry you're dealing with it too. I have some family, but no one to really fall back on for help. My family is pretty dysfunctional and messed up, and it's gotten worse over the years, shit sucks.

The economy we're in now is just insane, and barely even livable even if you do have a decent paying job. You'd think if you lived in a 1st world country that it would help disability people and people in need. I am so sorry for you loss friend as well as your current circumstances.

I am very sorry you are dealing with this. MDD is one of my main problems as well, and I've done so many different medications and treatments only to maintain a steady downward spiral in life. So I know what it is, very much.

,2643664,Kavka,"Aug 24, 2024 at 3:06 AM","Oh no, panic!

Have you noticed any rusty or reddish stains or dark spots on your sheets?

Bed bugs are brown/reddish and juvenile bed bugs (nymphs) are smaller, translucent or whitish-yellow in colour. If the things you found don't really match these sizes and colours (i.e. a larger whitish thing), then it's probably not bed bugs.

Thinking you have bed bugs and feeling like they're crawling all over you (even after a shower) is more evidence that you're freaking out than that there are actually bed bugs. I don't mean to trivialize your problem, but I feel like a bed bug panic is unfortunately a rite of passage for the neurotic. I know I've been there.

Is there anything you can do right now to distract yourself and calm down a bit? Maybe play some video games or watch a TV series?

You can buy big zip up bags to completely encase your mattress in.

You can buy powders and sprays to kill them. Take the mattress off the bed and put it in the bag. Thoroughly clean the bed and carpet. Use the spray or powder down the edges.

If your bed has legs, stand them in plastic cups- to prevent them crawling up the legs. You can actually buy plastic trays for this.

i would say this is your solution for your fear of insects. when applying it, wear a mask as it can irritate your lungs if you inhale too much. also wear goggles as the powder will linger in the air if you apply it too aggressively causing it to poof up.

,2651988,uglyugly,"Aug 30, 2024 at 6:07 PM","I dealt with those damn things in 2012 and it was a royal nightmare for me since I was allergic, but I did get rid of them.

I agree with the suggestion of diatomaceous earth (DE). It's pretty cheap and you need very little. I dusted all over my room, but mainly in cracks and crevices, plus I put it in all the folds of the furniture. Unless it gets wet, it's good forever because it kills the insects by cutting their exoskeletons and they dehydrate and die. Works for fleas, roaches and other bugs, too. Make sure whatever DE you get is food grade. It will say it on the packaging. Don't get the stuff for pools because it has chemicals in it that should not be used inside. DE is exceptionally safe, but wear a really good mask when dusting since you should not breathe it at all.

I bought a special mattress and box springs encasement because I refused to get rid of my bed. They are not the cheapest but do work to keep them from living inside your bed. (Well, technically if they are there the encasement traps them inside and they are not able to get out, thus they die of starvation. Bed bugs don't have chewing mouth parts so they can't chew through anything.)

I personally would recommend getting someone to check into it. Some exterminators will do so for free. BUT, I do understand where you are coming from. I don't like anyone in my house or in my space and I do not like upsetting news. But, these things don't go away on their own. I'm not trying to freak you out or upset you, but please be aware if you do have them and decide to sleep in the couch instead, they will find you since they are attracted to your body heat and the carbon dioxide you exhale.

Ultimately, I was able to get rid of mine by using food grade DE and encasing my bed. I ran all my clothes through the dryer on high for at least a half hour, then bagged and sealed them. (They MUST be sealed with no way in or out of the bag). For whatever could not go into the dryer, I bagged and sealed my possessions rather than throwing anything out. It was a time consuming, annoying process, but I had a serious reaction to being bitten so it was worth it.

,2662371,offbalance,"Sep 8, 2024 at 5:08 AM","US person here.
I feel like when attitudes change more toward seeing mental illness as legitimate and sometimes unsolvable will you see more people here supporting euthanasia. I think at least a part of it is that it's just plain uncomfortable for people to think about such unsolvable cases and they want to believe it's largely solvable. Like: Maybe the person isn't ""trying hard enough"", or has tried every medication, etc. There are people who have truly tried everything and are unfixable, I don't even think a lot of people would argue against euthanasia in those cases. Especially not the more liberal party here. But for the suicidals who haven't tried everything, I think they don't trust those suicidals enough when they say they feel unfixable. Why would that suicidal person try something that they know won't work? I understand both sides in this situation, because you can't know for sure something will work unless you've tried it. Maybe that medication will help you focus on the positive more, even if you think life is more objectively bad than good, which I think a lot of this forum does.

I think a lot of people would support euthanasia for those who have tried everything, or are undeniably incurable, they just don't see that number of people being large enough for the issue to gain a lot of traction and it's uncomfortable to think about the unsolvable cases so that might play a part.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2662391,Epikur,"Sep 8, 2024 at 5:33 AM","I´m from Germany.
Euthanasia or assisted suicide respectively has been de-facto legalized since the constitutional court toppled a law in 2020 that until then forbade any action by organisations or doctors. That decision was very well accepted by a vast majority. Churchmen went bananas, but that was to be expected.
We have organisations like the ""society for human dying"" who assist you as a member. Most interestingly, you do not need to have a dismal diagnosis. The organisation publishes its statistics every year. The service has been engrossed about 300 times a year. No rise for the past years. Only a few of these assistances were without a diagnosis. So, in opposition to those who forebode an explosion of assisted suicides, nothing happened actually. The number of registered suicides in Germany is at 10,000 each year, with rising tendency, on the other hand.

The reason why hardly any suicidal person asks for this service that there are some hurdles, naturally. You have to be a member of that association for at least half a year. And of course they´ll run an interview (or two I think) prior to any action. I suspect them of talking people out of their cbt ideas when there´s no severe illness. But, and that is new, they now openly discuss about to accept also mental illnesses as a reason to ask for assistance. Especially chronic depression is being more and more accepted as a disease that will lead to death in one way or the other.

So far the development is positive in that direction.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Look in the Netherlands where that woman did it due to her severe mental health.

,2627291,chester,"Aug 11, 2024 at 2:00 AM","I might be an idiot for caring about such things, especially that I have a perfectly good nitrogen setup at home and I can get myself killed in 5 minutes practically anytime I want.

BUT
I feel it's wrong. I know it wouldn't concern me, because I'd be dead, but somehow I still care about the impression I leave behind, and I don't want to be found with a bag on my head. I want people around me to think my death wasn't voluntary. At least I want to give it a try, it's not like I'm in a hurry, right? I think I found a way.

I'd like this thread to not only be about my idea, but I'm also interested in hearing about other methods.

It's a long shot, I do realize that, but hey, what do I have to lose? Worst case scenario, I'll go another way, especially that I have an alternative ready. So, get ready to laugh at me: licorice. Licorice and glycyrrhizin pills. Licorice candy to make it look like I'm dumb and had no idea, and the pills to actually get the job done. And yes, I can get my hands on actual licorice candy, and not just licorice flavored candy.



Why do I think this has a chance of working?
- I already have hypertension (around 140/90), which means I normally should probably stay away from the candy itself, not to mention the pills.
- Apart from the hypertension, there's something else wrong with my heart, I often get warnings on my smartwatch that my pulse is 120bpm while I'm sitting at my desk, barely moving.
- I live alone and I work from home. If anything happens to me, there's nobody to call an ambulance and I certainly won't.

What am I aiming at?
""Oh, poor chester, he was so devastated, he wanted to kill himself but he put on such a heroic fight to not do it, he was so strong. His heart couldn't take it anymore. And he should've known to stay away from licorice, but how could he have known?""

Do I know it won't be instant, painless and peaceful?
I know. And couldn't care less at this point. My fiancee's cancer also wasn't, so I don't mind. As long as I can be successful. Judging by the articles I've read, the people who survived, survived only because they were worried about their symptoms and went to the ER. So yeah, there's a very good chance it will be possible to save me, but the whole idea is that nobody will know I need saving. Ideally my heart will give up when I sleep, but maybe that's too much to wish for. We'll see how it goes.

I haven't found any discussion here about this, so I might be a licorice pioneer. Just to be clear, I don't have very high hopes with this method, but hey, if I'm gonna go anyway, might just as well do some research for the community, and who knows, maybe I'll actually save my face while I'm at it.

If anyone has any better idea, I'm more than happy to hear it. And no, I'm not interested in ""accidents"", I don't want anything drastic.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Not a lot of people, not a lot of traffic. Depending on who is on duty, I don't think they care too much, some might just want to clock out and not investigate. If it's foggy, even better for cover.

I took a closer look at how much space there was between the thick beam and the bridge to access the area below the bridge without the net. I wanted to take a pic but was afraid to drop my phone. Looks like it doesn't have as much clearance as I thought, it's definitely going to require you at least sit on the beam and sort of of slip off or it might even be better to lay down on your back or belly and then slide off that way with your head facing down.

The middle area between the 2 towers is ideal so you avoid the cement foundation of both towers. The other thing to look out for is any boats or people windsurfing but I doubt there are any at 6-7 pm. Another condition to look out for is how turbulent the water is. Apparently someone survived because of ""unusually high waves that day — there was a five-foot swell."" Got that from here https://www.theoakleafnews.com/news...gate-bridge-and-is-thankful-at-second-chance/

Everyone who is suggesting or choosing to ctb via 'N' and 'A' and 'H', that's cool. However, this thread is about GUNS (Not biceps) so.

First and foremost. The obvious.

https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/case-fatality/

According to a 1997 study from the University of Harvard, Firearms wield a 82.5% success rate. Where as drugs have a 1.5% SUCCess rate (C what I did there)? Now of course, if you're not American, it's pretty much impossible to get a reliable gun. Although black powder is a thing, and I will get into that, because you know, I think renaissance festival enthusiasts are pretty cool (It's a joke laugh). Okay. Anywho. Let's talk guns.

I think that there has been some misconceptions with guns and reliability.

'But TAW122 I can get N.'

https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/us/06ttdrug.html

While a totally old article, it still makes valid points and has correctly predicted trends in the United States. N is being manufactured less and less, and the legal demand for it just is not there. So yes. I'm sure they still use it in Mexico and other third world countries. It is also expensive. Are you truly ready for the painstaking and irritating time of finding a dark market, finding a reliable seller, and risking criminal prosecution (such as being intercepted by customs and all that shit)?

'But TAW122, I cannot purchase guns, I R not American'

In the UK, France, Italy, Poland, Czech Republic, and Serbia, you can purchase black powder replicas without a license.

Guns beat drugs every day of the week. Sorry guys. When it comes to reliability. This is how it works. Now. Before we get into the joys of muzzle loading and you renaissance festival lovers, we're going to discuss for everyone in North America.

If you live in the US and do not live in California, Illinois, Oregon, Washington, or New York, and you have not committed a felony, and have not broken ATF regulations. You can purchase a gun. Congratulations.

plz read the laws and make sure you follow them okay, thanks guise

If you're going to catch the bus with a firearm in the US or Canada, using anything short of a shotgun is not really reliable (unless you are experienced with firearms and know how to shoot it well, where to aim, steady hands, etc).

'But TAW122, I have a .44 revolver/only have access to a handgun.'

If you can afford a shotgun, you should REALLY consider buying one. Plus, I believe in many states long guns (aside from the anti-gun, 2A hating states) are generally easier to come by. I live in NC so I have the opposite problem (NC has a pistol purchase permit law which is a holdover from the Jim Crow era and only serves to inconvenience people to buy handguns).

'But TAW122, how do I buy a gun from le Internet?'



TL;DR - Your gun is shipped to a nearby guy who has a FFL. He holds the gun. You go to his place. He does the background check. You leave with your firearm.

'But ammo'

This is the only round you need. This is overkill and generally good if you can get it. However, birdshot does work too, and I personally have #4 shot, which will still be sufficient especially at point blank range.

'But TAW122, I am a minor'

Well, you shouldn't own a firearm in the first place. Wait until you are an legal adult (18 in the US), and then move out and/or go and buy one.

'But TAW122, I have never shot one before'




Watch some youtube videos, go to a local range where you live or something.

'But TAW122, I live in a state with harsh gun laws'

Muzzle Loaders and Black Powder. READ EM.

'But TAW122, I am an adult, yet live with my parents'

If you buy the firearm online and have it shipped to your FFL, it should literally take 30 minutes for a background check to be completed. You can be in and out in 30 minutes. EZ PZ.

'But TAW122, I can't do that.'

Muzzle Loaders do not require an FFL. You can have shipped right to your front door.

'But TAW122, black powder/muzzle loading when?'



It is just a bit more complicated, but with enough guides and videos on the Internet, I believe you should be able to figure it out.

The first example is not a handgun. It's a hand cannon. There is a difference.

'But TAW122, I live in Europe, I can't buy my guns online'

There are many gun stores in the UK that will allow you purchase REALLY overpriced renaissance festival cosplay equipment. Remember, when you go into the gun store, you're buying it because you're going to be Ollie Cromwell or Henry the 8th or something. Act enthused and passionate.

'But TAW122, I live in East Asia (China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, etc.)'

Gun ownership in Asia, especially in East Asia is very restricted and civilian ownership is pretty much banned.

'But TAW122, I live in Oceania, (Australia, New Zealand, Polynesia, Micronesia, etc.)'

Afaik, @stargazer has mentioned that is it very difficult to legally obtain a firearm in those countries.

'But TAW122, in the UK, licenses, licenses, licenses'

You must demonstrate a good reason for having one. Possession of, and intent to use, a gun that is only proofed for black powder is a good reason.

Hollywood representations of gun suicides are a very, very bad template to follow. Shooting yourself in the temple, or holding the gun under your chin, is a BAD idea, for either pistol or long-gun attempts. The odds are good you won't hit the all-important brainstem, but will instead blow out your frontal lobe and end up a vegetable. Some people have even blown off the entire front of their face and lived --and been able to survive without a life support machine. If you think your life is bad now...

These Hollywood aimpoints are probably the majority of why gun suicide statistics show only an 82.5% success rate rather than 100%.

I'll collect a few more thoughts and be back later.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Guns/firearms megathread,155053,TiredHorse,"Dec 10, 2018 at 6:42 PM","Handguns are perfectly functional, with the caveat that you need to use a large enough caliber. Technically speaking, any gun can work, but below a certain size threshold your chances of success drop significantly.

Modern handguns:

@Threads's preference for a .357 is well founded. A .357 is the benchmark against which all other calibers are measured for ""stopping power.""

Gun calibers can be extremely confusing --the more you look, the more confused you'll get-- but a good rule of thumb could be:

Revolver: anything .38 Special (marginal! --see note under ammunition) or larger --.357, .44, .45 Colt, .45ACP, etc.
Semiautomatic: anything 9mm or larger --.40, 10mm, .357Sig, .45

Avoid in either type of pistols: .22, .25, .32, .380, .38ACP. Will some of these smaller calibers work? Yes --technically. I have a .32 Auto that is likely to be my choice since it'll leave less mess than my .45ACP. The .380, aka 9mm Largo, is a good round, especially with modern ammo. BUT, you had better be very confident of your aim (I have shot competitively). If you are reading this thread with even a shadow of a doubt about where you need to aim, you should not look at these smaller calibers.

Revolver or semiautomatic?:

Revolvers are mechanically simpler and often attract less attention during purchase. You can also find them with a 2"" ""snub nose"" barrel that makes them very easy to handle.

Semiautomatics have become far more common than revolvers, so might be easier to acquire, but they are more mechanically complex.

And once again, Hollywood is a shitty place to learn about how to use either.

Ammunition:

Always, always, always use hollowpoints, sometimes abbreviated in conversation and on the box itself ""JHP"" (Jacketted Hollow Point). JHPs deliver all the kinetic force of the bullet in as short a distance as possible. I.e., into your head, rather than into the wall on the other side of you. The brand doesn't matter; they all work.

If you are using a .38 Special revolver, which is marginal, look for ammunition labled ""+P"" or ""+P+"". These are designations meaning the ammunition has been loaded with more powder than the standard ammunition, and thus will deliver more power.",155031,,,,,,,,,,,

As Threads says, .45ACP is a rare round for revolvers. You can find them, typically for use in competitive shooting, but they're enough of a specialty that you probably don't want to bother. If you want something bigger than .357 in a revolver, you could try .45 Colt, which is the more powerful, revolver-specific ancestor to .45ACP.

As I said, calibers can get confusing. With only a few exceptions, revolvers and semi-autos take completely different calibers, despite there being apparent similarities. .45ACP and .45 Colt are completely different calibers, and not even remotely interchangeable.

If you're set on using a semiautomatic, 10mm is a damned powerful round --but again, they aren't very common, despite how much hype the arms industry tried to give them a couple decades ago. A 9mm hollowpoint will do the trick, as will a .40 or a .45ACP.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Guns/firearms megathread,155146,TiredHorse,"Dec 10, 2018 at 8:14 PM","I'm going to risk @Threads's wrath here and --to annoy the rest of you all-- get a bit verbose.

.357Mag is the gold standard of what is popularly known as ""stopping power."" This is a hazy and arbitrary yardstick of what it takes for a cop to shoot a bad guy and have them go down and stay down. It is also a hotly contested yardstick, even if all of us gun-nuts agree that .357Mag is still the datum.

.357Mag won its place as the gold standard fair and square, but it won it at a time when most cops carried revolvers. Semi-autos --and therefore 9mm, .45ACP, and a host of other modern rounds-- weren't in the running. The primary contestant was the .38 Special, which is much less powerful, and thus didn't have a chance in the competition.

It should be pointed out that the military has never used the .357Mag. It has always (in the last 70 years) used the .45ACP and 9mm. And the military really, really likes stopping power.

.357Mag is still the gold standard for stopping power because it is, incontestably, a very, very powerful round. However, very few cops carry it any more except as a back-up revolver hidden somewhere under their body armor. There are two primary reasons for this: 1) Cops want more than six shots per gun, meaning they want to carry semi-autos, and there are very few (two?) semi-autos chambered in .357Mag; and 2) 9mm and .45ACP have resoundingly proven themselves to have perfectly adequate ""stopping power.""

Meaning 9mm and .45ACP, as well as a bunch of other calibers, all carried by LEOs and the military, have plenty of stopping power as well.

What I'm trying to explain is that while the .357Mag is an excellent choice for a caliber with which to be certain to ctb, it is not the minimum caliber capable of ensuring you ctb. There are certainly calibers that are much too small to be effective --only a complete idiot would attempt to ctb with .25ACP-- but there are many calibers less powerful than .357Mag with which you can be confident of success.

drug users use self IV all the time so basic enough learning is possible and all you need for CTB.
I'm also probably less worried than other people because I have really apparent veins. I also have gotten a lot of bloodwork most of my life. I'm panned now, but you can still see them very easy, and they are very prominent if you know what I mean.

The drug I'm putting in is something akin to fentanyl. Fentanyl you buy on purpose is really hard to come by rn, but still just as dangerously prevalent in heroin. Some nitazenes are also stronger than fentanyl.

I assume all I need to do is just overload the water plus opiate solution and inject it all. Not difficult to figure. It's not like I'm trying to survive after all.

So, what do you say then, are the kits bought on Amazon and medical websites for everybody are good quality and have everything you need?
(just wanna say, medical stuff is often available without credentials because of people with diabetes)

Are IV kits any good?,2655609,willitpass,"Sep 2, 2024 at 5:15 PM","IVs are different to what you are describing. An IV is a needle used to insert a cannula, the needle is then taken out and a little tube sits in your vein. This is dressed and kept in your vein with tubing attached. A syringe must be attached to the tube to inject any meds into your vein.

Drug users simply use a needle that they guide right into the vein and then immediately withdraw after shooting up with a syringe. It has to be the right kind of syringe that is long enough and the right thickness to entire into the vein.

Insulin needs are subcutaneous needles, meaning they are very short needles that only enter into the subcutaneous tissue, or a fatty layer of tissue very close to the skin. They do not reach muscle nor are they injecting into a vein. Only certain medications (such as insulin or blood thinners) can be given via this route. Giving a non subcutaneous med through this route will cause problems such as pain and swelling, but the medication would not be delivered properly and will likely not have the desired effect. Fentanyl like medications are not meant to be given this way.

IM, or intramuscular injections are given through a longer needle the is going to get to the muscular tissue, deeper than subcutaneous. It does not deliver it into the vein, it delivers it into the muscle. Again, only certain medications can be delivered this way, such as vaccines. Giving a medication that isn't meant to be given this way is going to cause problems but not give you the desired result.

Without proper knowledge about what you are doing this is a method more likely to cause problems than anything. Everything I just mentioned doesn't even get into thinks such as needle gauge size and the likes. Just because it is a needle doesn't mean it is what you are looking for.",2655601,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not saying go to nursing school, I'm advising you that it is not an easy task, especially from someone who appears to have limited medical knowledge. I am not going to advise you on methods because that is against forum rules.

If telling someone that their method is unreliable and more likely to cause harm than death makes someone pro-life then what's the point of this forum? If you don't want people to tell someone their method is dangerous or unlikely to work then let's just start letting people OD on tylenol or slit their wrist and never tell them why it's a bad idea. Just because someone is criticizing a method to keep someone out of harms way does not mean that they are doom-talking.

No, the doom talk is saying my method sucks, giving no further explanation, and then not telling me what to do because its 'against forum rules'
now you're just mocking me.

No it isn't. Half of this forum is people seeking information and getting advised on methods. I'm not asking you to help me die, or tell me how to do the method, or even a source for obtaining necessary materials.

Now that you've told me with great despair that IV is a bad way to insert fentanyl into my body, you have to tell me what I should do instead, otherwise I'll be clueless. And then the likelihood of me messing up in suicide is even greater because I'm uncertain! Yay!

And I'm sorry, I disagree with you. I think you're being overdramatic. People have suicided by IV who used this forum. A majority of people who I've asked about this say it's all right.
And are you saying shooting up like drug users do is not as deadly as regular IV?
Nursing students have advised its the best way to do it too. it looks learnable and it is OK for it to be robust because I'm trying to commit suicide, not safely deliver an IV.
Please, you're honestly making it even more unsafe for me by saying oh IV is bad and then not telling me what is better, leaving me without an ROA.

Can anyone come in here and correct this person? It's kind of cruel for someone who says they're knowledgeable to make someone question their reality.
I love the fact that I came away with no more information than I had before and more doubt. This person comes in, not knowing the answer to my question but instead tries to fill my head with doubt.

UNRELIABLE is different from highly inadvisable. maybe I missed that somewhere in what willitpass said (no sarcasm, i might've) but I didn't see them say 'reliable'
plus i just want to know - hanging is talked about regularly on this site and is attempted and advised more than opiates?? like i understand if there's less INFO on opiates but it is not the same thing as 'bad'
and suicide itself is an unreliable thing, just like accidental death. just comes with the territory.

I'm sorry for any slight paraphrasing btw.

i've been told IV is 'the best' many times (and including other users saying they're addicts and health pros) and I really didn't think I, not a pro, could do it. then I googled it and it looked learnable. several of these users agreed.
if i have to worry now about the 'passing out before enough is injected' thing then i'd like to ask about that. Should I create a new thread?

honestly aside from that and wondering if the kits are any good (still uncertain though im thinking it might be better to purchase serpate supplies) I might have all the info I need.
Please don't scare me into thinking I have to pick something different like that. Perhaps I'll make another separate thread (laterer) asking whats as high bio-avail as IV but more reliable.
want to note really quickly I don't like have IV saline bags on a hook like in the ER or anything i was going to inject the solution into a cannula through a butterfly needle in my arm but if that's crazy and its supposed to be different let me know.

Are IV kits any good?,2656545,nottinghams,"Sep 3, 2024 at 2:03 PM","I decided to reread your whole comment much more carefully.
I know about needle gouges and sizes. I have gotten blood work done from a vein in my arm multiple times a year for most of my life. my veins have always been very apparent and very visible. As well as also being larger. I know this makes starting an IV easier.
I know I have to use more than just any needle. I know about subcutaneous and IM, and that IM too can actually fail to give me my desired result. This was the Route I used that apparently was half the reason why my ctb failed.

and I know that IV refers to the needle with the cannula as you said. They often use a butterfly needle. 'IV' is just often used to refer to this route.
The only times IV is used regularly on a person that I know of is bloodwork like I had and in-hospital medication and drip bags.
I can promise you I am not referring to a drip bag or continuous IV for my application.
I am just choosing IV because it has a 100% bio availability rate, as well as instantaneous delivery (the most out of most routes such as subq, im, rectal, snort, etc.) Which obviously makes it the most fatal, which we want lol.
I see no difference between drug users 'shooting up' as you described and starting an IV on myself (like with bloodwork) both are IV as they channel directly into the vein. But you let me know if there is.

I was thinking maybe it was better to start a cannula on myself than to shoot straight up because I might not deliver enough medication to die. All that cannula is going to be is the exact same as a blood draw but quickly injecting something instead.

So yes, I think I know a lot of necessary details already and when I google videos intended for nursing students, it seems learnable to me. And I am not trying to safely deliver a medication, of course. It can be rudimentary.
And I'm really tired right now because I'm tired all the time from being continuously sick so maybe im forgetting things, but I have had conversations with users that are drug users and users who say they are in a medical field, Who say they think I can do it.

Perhaps we really just misunderstood each other.
This thread itself was created to see if I could save costs by purchasing a kit intended for students instead. Now I hope I've corrected myself a little, and that you see this message.

don't see how now that IV is not a great choice... So I hope you reply and I hope you agree with that.

My mother was in the hospital for months. I had the opportunity to watch the nurses. It was a great education for me. I watched videos on Youtube also. On my first try, I inserted a 22g cannula into a large vein near the antecubital fossa. It is definitely not a very difficult task, but the point is to understand the procedure very well and to practice a lot before CTB! Even a nurse is not as good as me at inserting a cannula into herself now. I have done this many times. I usually do this to measure the flow rate of my injection system. I made a gravity fed injection system that works with 3 syringes. Learning an IV is definitely not difficult if you are really determined. The point is, a lot of practice.

11am 2 or 3 Tylenol with codeine plus 5 mg Klonopin. I will start with one mg Klonopin and slowly increase through the hour depending on my anxiety level. I have a very high tolerance to Klonopin because I've been on it for many years

11.30 am dissolve 25 G of SN in 50 ml water times two glasses

followed by mixing 20mg crushed Klonopin in small amount of water. 20 mg is the conversion from Oxazepam which is listed in the PPH. However I still think it's a high amount to take immediately after drinking your first glass of SN. Oxazepam has a slow onset while Klonopin does not. Which means I should hold off drinking it for as long as possible so I will be alert to drink my second glass if needed. If I pass out and throw up it might equal failure.

12 pm. drink SN

followed by drinking Klonopin crushed in small amount of water. I'll try to hold off drinking the Klonopin as long as possible. Wait till vomiting subsides. Drink second glass of SN if vomiting takes place.

I have pretty bad cognitive impairment so please be kind

How does it look?

I'm not sure how many people will understand when I say hold off on drinking the benzos because I have to use Klonopin instead of the other recommended benzos.

Sorry I'm not a more help but I can't help but reminisce, but many cold nights, very lonely walking down Elmwood
I cared for a young woman who was permanently bound to a nursing home, this was in another city in New York, she jumped from 4 stories high and just became a paraplegic with little use of one arm and obviously no use of her legs. Incredibly sad 20 something and relegated to a nursing home forever wearing a diaper.
I don't mention this story as a scare tactic but just as a reminder how questionable even that height is, poor woman. I also worked with two individuals who will forever be in a nursing home due to strokes and seizures caused from attempted ODS

Flipping a coin,2664831,Save_Me_Mind,"Sep 9, 2024 at 10:05 PM","Ahahaha, where am I now?! It seems that attempt that I survived with a less than 8% chance of survival, it seems it's been more than a year since, and what the FUCK am I doing now haha?! EVER since that day, actually no. Even days before the attempt contributed as well. But I am in the SAME PLACE that brought me CTB in the first place. Instead NOW, I have LOST all my FEELINGS and I continue with my anhedonia. I am a sociopath, I see the world completely differently and commit acts that are seen as disgusting by society standards. FUCK society, I want to be myself, I want to commit more sinful acts to express WHO I AM. I don't see them as WRONG, I only say sinful because that's how the rest of you all see it. I see a lot of myself in a character named Himiko Toga, I wish to be free and be myself. People look down on me, BUT THEY DON'T KNOW THE REAL ME!

So now what to do. Well... I hate it all. I wish to leave. 50% wants to truly depart and 50% wants to stay (ONLY because I want to gain what I once lost). A person who probably thinks I'm DEAD, and I know damn well that they don't care about me or wish to BE WITH ME anymore. I FUCKED UP BECAUSE I WAS FORGED THIS WAY. I GET THAT, I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND. I WAS JUST A CHILD, so please forgive me. That's all I ask for is forgiveness. I am mentally unwell but can hide it like it's nothing.

I've constantly had the thoughts of wanting to depart like I used to and all of you, except now I feel it getting too close just like last time. Very soon I will be nothing but a memory and those so called friends won't give a damn. Why do I have to have such a miserable unlucky life after trying SO FUCKING HARD DESPITE ALL ODDS.

If you care about anything I said, please message me something because Fuck, I need it. Please, this is disgusting of myself to say, but please just give me any support, any kind messages, please, even if they're fake. My brain is going too deep and I can't escape. There is no beacon of light in sight and I am continuing down this cold abyss by myself once more.

Fuck it, no one loves me... and I only love one person, and she must be enjoying life by now. I miss you, I do.

I am not thankful, I hate it all. My mind is too torturous and it cannot think correctly like the rest of you, I can't feel. So I will depart soon from this miserable life.

I still love you even after years.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"Coming from a ex “normie,” I don’t think most people who haven’t been seriously suicidal will ever understand us if they never go through it",2659694,Ariii,"Sep 5, 2024 at 8:31 PM","During my early teens, a lot of my online friends were very suicidal. I had had my own mental issues, but never to the point where I seriously considered suicide (at most, it was just impulsive thoughts on occasion). Looking back, I regret how I treated these people. My memory isn't clear of how I actually acted, but I know for a fact that I discouraged it as much as possible. For one of my friends, I think it was relatively fine to act this way, he ended up getting therapy, and while I lost contact, I know he was doing better.

But for a lot of those people, especially one guy in particular, looking back, I just needed to stfu. He had been suicidal since 8 and had tried literally everything: 3 therapist, multiple medications, etc. He told me this point blank, yet I still tried to discourage him. I was literally unable to comprehend why he would want to die that bad. Even when it was clear that there was nothing that would work for him, I still tried to discourage him. I genuinely couldn't understand why he would want to die, when, to my peanut brain, he still had a lot of options to get better.

Obviously, I don't expect a 12-15 yo to be able to properly handle these types of situations. But that isn't my point. My point is that if someone has never gone through being seriously suicidal, they will almost never be able to properly empathize with us. The desire to live is so entrenched with these people (or the desire hasn't been challenged enough), that it is incomprehensible to feel so hopeless to CTB. While talking to these people slightly shifted my view on suicide as something that should never happen to maybe at times, it is the best solution, I only ever realized that for many people, it is the only viable solution after I became suicidal myself.

I think this is because a) it is harder to empathize with something you've never gone through and b) people who don't consider suicide simply don't think enough about the complexity of it. Suicidal people are going to think about suicide more and probably interact with more suicidal people. Once someone starts doing that, they will realize how there are many people who have tried everything, yet nothing has changed. That there are some situations that are so painful, yet doesn't have cures (eg. childloss). That there are some people who are unwilling to conform to suicide, who don't want to work for literal decades for very little reward. That there are people with such serious trauma and depression that what we count as basic tasks, is like climbing Mt. Everest. And so much more, there are so many situations where recovery simply isn't viable within reason.

Sure, in an ideal society, where everyone has good and cheap accesses to top-tier treatment, less people would CTB. But we don't live in that society, and probably never will. There are so many suicidal people who will never have it. Yet people propose it as THE solution to suicidailty. Normal people simply don't understand/care enough about how we feel and our struggles to propose a better solution. How they see it, death=bad therefore, do anything you can to avoid it. To them, it worth it to be locked up in a mental hospital or to be put into debt or to be isolated bc ppl don't want to deal with suicidal ppl, as long as they live.",,,,,,,,,,,,

You can fight with them until your last breath but they will never get our side unless they experience it themselves. Not to mention the survivorship bias of those who were suicidal and made a true recovery who decide that just because they did it so can everyone else.

I only wish people could have the same sympathy for mental agony as they do for physical agony. Someone doesn't have to understand personally the excruciating pain of dying from cancer to believe that hospice or assisted suicide are reasonable paths to take. It is well understood that physical illness can reach the point of becoming unbearable and that to throw in the towel and request to cease treatment and die is something that can happen. But for some reason people struggle so hard to accept that mental pain can be just as great. There is no amount of treatment options that will make most people willing to accept that someone no longer wishes to live. Fighting cancer for 5 years is seen as heroic and they put in the good fight but just couldn't do it anymore. Fighting severe mental illness for 14 years with no more treatment options but you have to stay strong, never give up, there is always hope! It's like mental pain isn't seen as true pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I've spent a total of 2 years of my life inpatient and left with nothing but trauma. Are there a few more things I could try? Yes, but they are all relatively new with questionable efficacy (TMR, DBS, ketamine) and I don't think that after spending my entire life fighting that I should be forced to continue living just to become a guinea pig for frontline mental health research. If someone wants to try then go ahead! If you have the energy to further mental health treatments and research and want to do it please do! It's great to pave the way to new treatment methods. But it should not fall on those of us who are exhausted beyond belief, do not want to try it, and have no fight left to give to keep living. No one would force a cancer patient who is tired and ready to die to take on clinical trials.

First, keep in mind I was suicidal for 9 years of my life, I dealt with others people suicidality and recently lost someone to suicide. I talked to several people about CTBing, people who were going through the same and people who weren't, I heard different opinions about the topic and I experienced the pain.

But still, even understanding the feeling and having seen it expressed in so many people, if someone ever told me they wanted to die, most of the time I would try to convince them to do the opposite. I mean, even when I wanted to CTB I would still try to talk them out of that mindset, because ""culturally"", legally and politelly it was the thing I always thought I should do. So, when I talked about it before, sometimes it went like. ""I want to CTB"", ""me too but you shouldn't do it"", ""why are you saying that? you don't understand me"", ""I do but don't do it"". Strangelly, in my mind I could never ""support"" that decision. I understand about the pain, how sometimes the person did everything, but it's just against my values to support it. Of course I agree it should be legal and with easy access if someone wants to CTB, because it's their life, and you do what you want to do with it, you should really do what is best for you. If that's your desire, I wish you peace, but I would never say ""yes, you should do it"", I will wish you peace while telling you other options, not to be like ""that's wrong you can do that and get better"" but just to be sure I did and said what I could, the final decision was theirs. So, first question, do you think that's still wrong and a lack of empathy from me?

If someone that you meet in real life, after some days talking, tell you their plans about CTBing, what would you say? What do you think would be a good reaction and action after that?
And what if it was someone from your family or a dear old friens?
I'm asking this firstly because I want different opinions but also because I think an important part of this discussion is the relationship of the person who plans to CTB and the person who's ""advising"" them.
I understand you're venting, I just want to comment this about this section:
It's very interesting to talk about society's role on this, because it's not something individual, the treatment suicidal people get is problematic. The idea that death equals bad is rooted in religious beliefs, yes, but, as in many cases, interfers with other people lifes. However, it's not only the fact that they want to control our actions (saying it's some time of protection), it's the sadness of loosing someone and never seeing a loved one again that impacts the individualistics encounters and talks about the topic. Yes, in an ideal society everyone would get access to treatments and also have the freedom to choose to go, but now talking about how things are in the world and how small and far is the possibility for this change (to the ideal society), would be interesting to discuss the topic of how mental health and suicide is seen, because if it's at least something talked about, more people could be helped and goodbyes could be said freely. Yes, it's not ""THE solution to suicidailty"", like you said, but it's a possibility and a step to a ""solution"". Maybe beeing able to talk about it, being understood and not judged, would actually save more people than the pro-lifers think.",2659694,2659694,,,,,,,,,,

I want to maintain health until CTB as well. I figure, while I'm here, I may as well try to be comfortable. And bodily suffering can be immense. So it's best to try and avoid that if you can.

And I don't necessarily think it's mental fortitude that helps with discipline (though maybe I don't give myself enough credit, idk), but rather my fear of health problems. Alcohol is fucking terrifying in terms of effects on the body. I've also had a horrible family history with alcohol and that certainly ingrained in my mind the need to be careful with it. I'm also familiar with addiction, as I used to be extremely addicted to weed for years. So I know the patterns to look out for when things start to become a problem. I do also relate to being unable to stop drinking once I start. That is one of the main reasons why I keep it to once a week, since I almost always get blackout drunk cause I can't stop. If I was getting blackout drunk every day or every other day, fuck, I'd've probably ended up like MittenSquad (YouTuber who died from Alcohol related health issues at 27). And that's not the kind of death I want, too much suffering and too prolonged. So as a rule, I have to keep my drinking to a minimum. But I find once a week is good enough for me, as it gives me something to look forward to at the end of the week and it's a nice mental respite.",2659197,,,,,,,,,,,

If I had known how difficult life was I would have CTB far earlier in my life but I kept having optimism that things would improve and yeah, at times they did for a short while but it was a rollercoaster with more dips than plateaus or high points.

I don't have a ton of info though, it's a hard topic to discuss in the family so please take this with a grain of salt. Two of them also died more than 20 years ago so keep that in mind.

1. Woman, 18 years old, ctb by rat poison. This was much more than 20 years ago and I've read that rat poison nowadays is much less fatal than it was back then. This method is also incredibly painful...

2. Man, late 20s/early 30s, ctb by hanging. Don't know if it was partial or full. He died much more than 20 years ago as well.

3. Woman, late 70s/early 80s, ctb by OD on psychiatric meds. This happened around 8 years ago. She was Bipolar, was taking a lot of meds including sleeping pills. I don't know which meds she used for ctb, no one in my family will talk about that. She was in a coma for quite some time until her daughters decided to pull the plug. Ctb by OD is extremely unreliable, I think her age played a big part.

From all these 3, I think the most reliable would be hanging.

I fucking hate having an Eating disorder but I can never stop,2660886,Noct,"Sep 6, 2024 at 9:30 PM","I fucking despise having bulimia. Having an ED would have been fine if It had just been Anorexia but no, I had to fucking develop the classic binge purge cycle that kills me.

I love my restriction cycles. They may dull out my brain until my stupidity gets so bad I'm no better than roadkill but I feel so alive. I finally fit better into my skin and finally feel like I'm accomplishing something. I get to watch the numbers finally rack down and see my ribs stand out and fit into clothes that I bought stupidly when in a good restriction cycle.

And then... I binge. Sometimes it's because of the hunger and urges, others it's fucking eating out my feelings or dysphoria or any number of things when I'm too weak to cut or burn, can't stand being around anyone, and feel so restless in my body and mind needing to escape that I find something to fill that void for me and drown everything out with the mad rush and repetitive motion of eating.
And then I keep eating even when I feel full and sick and disgusting and delirious and nauseous and disfigured and disgusted at myself. I just can't fucking stop eating. Its a hideous thing. Sometimes others cant even tell, and sometimes I'm so glutenous and deranged I have to sequester and binge in the safety in my own home, or in the dead of night or random breaks or random intervals just to hide this terrible horrifying undesired unbidden ritual. Not that that helps with the self loathing and absolute disgust I feel. Can you tell I just came out of a binge? I wish I could kill myself by cutting open my stomach and spilling all the contents of my guts out, that way I can guarantee better than checking my purging puke for all the foods I consumed and if they have left my system. I'm so grotesque and horrifyingly-everything I feel my body should never be. I hate being trans and I hate having body image issues other than dysphoria stacked on top of dysphoria. It's awful and insanity inducing, and a never ending cycle of pure agony. My life revolves entirely around food, my body, and if I'm passing.

And sometimes I can't even purge. I feel so tired and bogged down or dissociative I cant even get myself to do more than lay on the cool tile floor or pass out. Sometimes I just want to punish myself and push myself into a panic attack so I can get out of my binge. Or other times, I purge too late and all I get up is acidic liquified version of the food that burns my throat so badly I can't speak for days afterward (depending if I purge multiple times in a day). Those days are the worst. Today is one of those gods forsaken days and I want to die. I cant handle living in my mind or body or feeling bloating and the horror of seeing the sheer amount of things I ate without even registering.

I want to be able to just restrict without the binging so god damn badly. I know the only way to fix the binging is to fix my eating but I cannot live without restricting and I cannot restrict without the binging (I've learned from years of fighting the urges, and denial, and trial and error, so much error, and then cutting, and purging, and pain, and bile, and weight fluctuation, and body imbalances).

I want to be dead so damn badly. I'm too weak, pathetic, worthless, ungrateful, and disgusting to live, and yet too scared of failure and of pushing the two people I care wholeheartedly about (and unreasonably have stuck round me) to their own deaths to die. At this point today all I can hope is that someone understand my living hell as I am unable to kill myself sucessfully even if I wanted to tonight.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I miss genuine human contact like that but it's not fair to someone to put that on them especially when I know it will not change the outcome. And I cannot risk someone interfering.

Once you're identified they can pretty easily find relatives to notify. At that point I do believe it would be up to your family to arrange getting your body back to your home country or leaving you there, though I'm not certain about that one. Even if they do decide to leave your body there you won't be left to rot. Every country has their own policy, but usually they either cremate you or put you in a paupers grave.

I have also made improvements in my personal hygiene. However, despite these changes, I still feel a sense of obligation to go through with my previous plan. I don't see a future for myself and often feel a sense of pure emptiness consuming me. I'm either feeling utterly piss off or down as hell.

I've been working on my plan for awhile now, ever since i discovered SN. Every time i think about how it feels to use it (I extensively read the guides and discussions) I feel anxiety and my heart thunders in my chest. It makes me afraid i will regret it when i know that it's what i want.

I have someone who means a lot to me that i will be willingly leaving behind. it hurts to think about how my death will hurt him, but i have come to terms that i don't mean to him what he means to me. my place in his life is ultimately insignificant. i desperately want to tell him that i'm at the end of my rope and planning to end my life, because deep down i hope it would change things, but i know that is not how things work. i can't change him or make him love and care about me. he was my last tether to life and, really, i just can't handle the hurt and sadness anymore.

I met him here. Never imagined something like that could happen, so randomly, and be so important to me. Of all places, here.

We met a week after I discovered my method of choice, the day I went to buy everything. I was extremely excited and he said it was weird for me to be acting like that, to be so happy for it, while I felt like a dream coming true.
We talked for days until he suggested to spend some days in my city, for a concert. I agreed. I was so anxious the days before. It was great to spend time with him, and really hard to say goodbye. I did, I said my goodbye, we agreed it would be the last time we talked and I knew about his plans. But do we really believe in a forever goodbye?

Those days with you were amazing. I lied, I wanted more. You knew, I know you knew, but it was for the best.

He was my friend, I love him and loved the days we spent together, but although we literally met at this website and we both planned to CTB, I still can't believe he did it. I can't believe someone I met, spent so much time together, had intimacy and love, could actually do it. When I thought and planned to CTB it sounded different. When I read other people talking about it here, it was different. When you actually lose someone, it's totally different.
He was my friend, I really miss him.

I hope you're ok, happy, safe. I hope she is too and you're together. I hope for everything good to you.

So, he had his ""happy ending"", and although I knew it would happen, it was a shock to know he's not here anymore.
How? He was a whole human being with so much history, we had experienced so many things together, we were together and now he's not even alive anymore? How can the skin I touched now be buried? How could that happen? I can't manage to understand. I'm happy for him because he really wanted that, he was suffering here, he really didn't see an out, but again, how could this be fucking real? How can someone I love be gone because they chose so? I'm reconsidering my own plans to CTB because this fucking fucked situation is so shitty I get mad to think people I love could feel like that. I know why he did it, the many reasons to do so, I'm happy for him to have achieved his goal, but I'm still sad and mad for it. I couldn't save him. I couldn't save her. I can only save me, the last person who would want to be saved. I'm here, still. I just want him to be ok. I can't believe he's not here anymore. I wanted a last goodbye. A thousand more.

I guess I never believed you. I told you I don't understand death.

I want you back :(

Now, I guess I'm experiencing grief again and don't have anyone to talk about it. I wanted people to understand it mattered to me.

You mattered. I hope you know that.

Thank you for those days.

It was more than something random, I'll carry our memories with me, with love. I hope to learn to be okay with your absence soon. I wish with all my heart you're in peace.

I just needed, and still do, to talk about it. It's hurting like I didn't think it would. I'm so... It's like the part of my heart where you lived it's now shattered. You're not here. I'll never see you again. How can that be possible?

Well, thank you for reading until here. I'm... I don't even know how I am doing anymore. I'm sad and angry and confused. Loss is terrible, in any way.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If I leave, I'll never have great experiences again. Yes, it's cruel that it goes away, but it's better to have had it for a while than to never experience that. Love, for example, we can't promise it forever, but it's amazing while it lasts. Losing someone is deeply painful, but imagine to never have known them, never talk, touch, play, have memories with them, all lost. So yes, it might be painful some day, but it might be amazing as well.

Although, if life is being experienced with more pain then pleasure, I also don't see a point, because, yeah, it would be (and it is for many people) cruel.",2646911,,,,,,,,,,,

,2650147,Hitakiri,"Aug 29, 2024 at 11:52 AM","I feel for you, I really do. I myself am.. far more acquainted with loss than I'd like to be. Every day without her feels like a lifetime of dying slowly. And yet.. I want to live. I want to feel what she made me feel, even the grief. She had no one, nothing. I was it. Sometimes I feel like I wasn't enough to save her, but cancer isn't something you can just beat with your fists. I'm all that keeps her memory alive. All that holds her dearly in my heart. When I die, the memory of her dies with me. It's a thought I cannot bear. I used to long so desperately for death. Now I feel like a fool. She wanted to live, so fucking badly. I wanted her to as well. I convinced myself she would. That cancer can be beaten, and that she'd overcome it no matter what. Life isn't always kind. But it can be. It let me know her, before she was gone, after all.

I have spent whole nights lying awake asking why. Why I made it and she didn't. When nights are bad and I think ""tonight I might end it"" her name gets stuck in my mind. It creates a space between my finger and the trigger. My love for her is all that stands between me and death. And each time I hear her voice ask me,
""how badly do you want this life? It's all I ever wanted, but you got it - so what are you willing to do, to keep it?"" To throw it away would be an insult to her, and what she wanted for me. So I try to make her proud. I try to be kinder than I have to be, uplift those who are struggling. It's selfish in a way, as I'm not doing it for them. I'm doing it for myself, to feel a sense of purpose, and for her. She was always so kind to everyone. I never deserved her. But I'm going to spread that kindness she poured into me, and live for the both of us.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I want to end my pain so badly but I'm thinking about the pain I'm going to put my 80 year old mother through.
She's had been the most amazing mother, giving up everything as a single mother it was really tough on her but she never let it show, working so hard to take me and my siblings on trips, protecting us ,the love she gave us is in measurable.
It breaks my heart to even think about this, I hurts so bad, I can't stop crying.
I don't know what to do all I do is think about this and I'm in such turmoil , one moment I say I can't take anymore of this agony I'm going to ctb but in the same instant my thoughts go to her and I can't bring myself to do it and the crazy thing is that my love for her is so strong that the very thought of her passing, just the one instant of witnessing her passing, I think that I can't be around for that the pain will just be too much, even if it's just for that moment before I ctb, I just wouldn't be able to tolerate it so as strange as this sound, I want to ctb for that reason so that I don't have to go through that pain but what about the pain she's going to go through.
I know it's selfish of me and I feel like a bad daughter but my pain is unbearable.
I wish there was an easy answer, if I could just snap my fingers and we'd be both gone along with my siblings, why is this so difficult, I'm so angry that I have to be out through this, god, the universe, whatever there is, is so cruel.
I almost feel like it enjoys watching me suffer, I'm just so angry, so sad, so confused, in such unbearable emotional pain. All I can think of is why, why am I being put through this what did I do to deserve this torture. It angers the hell out of me… is anyone else going through this?",,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm fairly young (early 30's). I would say I'm waiting for my parents to die before I go but I doubt I can wait that long. My mother is an active happy healthy person with probably 30-40 more years left; sometimes I worry she'll outlive me (I have some type of undiagnosed condition, whatever it is isn't good) My dad is aging as badly as my mom is well, but he still has at least a decade left if not more. My sister will be fine, she's way too ""normal"" to not get over it after a couple years.

I'm planning to combine and use three methods to make sure my organ is broken, increasing my CTB success, and minimizing the chance of being helped by other people.

I'm planning to start this journey today at 1 September 2024, and I hope to successfully CTB max at week three this month. I need to take care of a few things before I CTB so I can CTB as soon as possible. I will immediatly complete my process of CTB after all the thing i need to care done.

I will start first by stop eating any food and only drink water till the day i death. After all the stuff i need to take care is done i will traveling to new city to enjoy my last moment and find nice place to execute the second and third method.

The second method i will use is drinking insecticide, i have seen a few case people died on my country died from this method so probably this method is effective as long as no one interfere but i still can't be sure about the success rate of this method so i only do this to damage my internal organ. Lastly just a few moment moment after i drink the insecticide i will hang myself in the wood to finalize my CTB.

,112559,Kooz,"Oct 28, 2018 at 9:21 PM","Hey everyone,

Been talking to a lot of people in the chat and trying to explain this method, and one user wanted me to make a post about it, so here goes everything.

We're going after a classic idea of using a blood choke, except, it will be against ourselves. In the privacy of our own homes. In a fully relaxed state.

This method is fully capable and will kill you very fast. I know this because it's what we were taught in the Marine Corps.

First, you're going to want some Gorilla tape OR a tree ratchet.

Second, get two Sackhole/Cornhole bags.

Now, depending on what you're using, you'll want to lie on the ground and put the bags on these two exact areas on your neck (In blue).



The reason we're lying on the ground is that we want to be able not to have to fuss over putting the bags on us and making sure they don't fall out of place before we use the ratchet or the tape. You're putting the bags on these two areas to go after the internal carotid arteries.

Start cinching the ratchet closed or wrap the tape around your neck once. Is everything feeling good? I'm glad. If not, then uncinch it a little and place the bags. You want to make sure that you're not compressing the windpipe as that could cause you to freak out a little.

We want this to be painless and fast.

After you're comfortable, sit down if you want to or stand up. Do whatever you want honestly. Start wrapping the tape around your neck more and a little tighter or start closing the ratchet more.

In about 5-20 seconds you will pass out. After that, it's pretty much game over unless you somehow hit the ratchet release. That's why I said we could also use tape as well. With the gorilla tape, it will make sure that you don't inadvertently try to tear the tap off... because it will be strong as hell around your neck.

After you pass out, it will only take a few minutes, and you will be brain dead from the complete lack of blood flow to your brain.

I think I've explained this pretty well and I hope you guys understand the method. If not, please don't hesitate and I'm sure that I can help you out or someone else in the community can help you out.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,113399,Kooz,"Oct 29, 2018 at 2:59 PM","It would work with an endless ratchet strap.

For a better idea of how to use it, watch this:



The best way to think about it is that the ratchet is going around your neck (with your padding), instead of the desk.


I can't speak for anyone else, but the method is pretty much painless. The biggest thing that might happen is that you'll feel your head ""expand"" a little more and feel the pressure around your neck. I've been blood choked multiple times in the Marines, and the only thing that I ever felt was the other person pressing against my neck with their arms. Then I started passing out, and I would have to tap out, or I would have been knocked out completely.

Something very important, if anyone is still kind of confused, then this video is PERFECT at what you're trying to execute. Except we're going for a little more padding to allow us to cover more ground, effectively cutting off MORE of the carotid arteries.




I would say that you would want to have the ratchet on the back of your neck, so the strap is in the front. So imagine that the cornhole bags or whatever is on your neck for padding has the strap directly in the middle of it. Then you can start tightening the ratchet behind your neck.


This is another thing that you can do if you want to, I won't CTB with a bag on my head though. With the blood choke, I want to pass out and have the brain have no blood at all. I want to be able to breathe perfectly fine while I start passing out and then just go from there.

Though, I will say this, cutting off oxygen and then suffocating from there will be more efficient as you're cutting off both the blood to your brain AND the Oxygen.


This will completely depend on the person honestly. With the ratchet method, you DO NOT even have to apply that much pressure (As stated in the video above). You can tighten it more though if you want to make sure that you know it's barely going to budge. You're still cutting off the blood flow to your brain though. You just want to make sure that the ratchet is tight enough to your liking and keeping the bags in place.

The reason I recommended both as stated before is that it will come down to personal preference. If the tape bothers your skin too much, go with the ratchet, or vise versa.


As stated before, you just want to go with just enough or just a little over so that you start cutting off the circulation. It completely comes down to personal preference. With the ratchet or tape though, you have MORE pressure being put against the bags which will allow more pressure against the arteries.


It will just take practice to find your sweet spot. I hope that I described everything as much as possible in this update.


Exactly, or if you want to think of it differently, it's the specific parts of the arm in the linked video above.


You could I guess. The way I think you're talking about it, I would personally tie it to the door and then the other part of it around my neck. Then I would be on my knees and make sure the line is straight. After that, I would lean forward.

The HUGE problem with doing that though is if it's not applying enough pressure and your body goes limp, then the padding could come loose and then you have no pressure against the arteries so it could be a failed attempt.

,113485,Kooz,"Oct 29, 2018 at 4:31 PM","Yep! You just want to make sure that it's long enough with some extra slack to go around your neck.


I would do it lying on your back. Cinch it a little so that you're comfortable with the position of the padding and the ratchet itself. If the handle is getting too much in the way on the back, then sit up a little and try to cinch it from there... but do it slowly. That way you can make sure the padding is exactly where you want to. After that, you can go sit down if you want to and continue to cinch.

If you're doing it with tape, I would just recommend giving yourself enough space so that you can easily go around your neck a couple of times.

You could start the tape off one side of your neck and apply it there, then go over one bag, then the other. After you feel like they're in the proper place, then go to your favorite chair or couch and wrap the tape around a few more times, but just a little tighter.

If it takes more than 20 seconds to even feel anything, then there are a few possibilities.

1. Either you don't have the tape or ratchet tight enough.
2. The padding is in the wrong place.
3. You're blacked out and no longer having to worry about a god damn thing.",113476,113479,,,,,,,,,,

,2656373,chester,"Sep 3, 2024 at 10:20 AM","I'm actually researching this option as my plan B and I stumbled upon this thread. Based on what I've read, they make your blood pressure and pulse very low until your heart eventually stops beating completely. Sounds peaceful to me, but hard to say. It will definitely have an impact on your mental state, less blood being supplied to your brain would make your consciousness gradually fade away.

This probably won't be instant though, may take hours and you're likely to survive if you get found in time. It's also hard to estimate a reliable dose. I suppose every method is a lottery to some degree, but if you want quick and reliable then it might not be your best bet. I have my own reasons for considering this method, I'm more interested in dying than death itself. Doesn't mean I'd like to survive it though. My plan would be take some meto over a couple of days, grind a shitload of pills in a mortar, mix them with water and drink the suspension. And by shitload I mean ""definitely way more than I've read about in the medical articles"".

But that's just my plan B, we'll see how plan A goes. I do have SN as plan C, but this isn't really my preferred way of dying, it's just my last resort.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I cant get into it, but there is a gross exaggeration of my actions and the truth is nowhere near enough for me to be labeled how I currently am and affect my life and career.

The situation is difficult because the way I know the rumors have spread is that students have been hinting at me without actually directly addressing the accusations. I ran into one of the administrators (who I never met before) and they made an offhand comment that struck me as odd but made me realize they were hinting at it as well. Thus, I have no way of addressing these rumors as I haven't been directly addressed by anyone. The only way I can make any action is if I get formally cited/summoned by administration.

Unfortunately I wont know the true outcome until I get formally addressed or I find out at near the end of my program which is still a few years away. The paranoia and anxiety of such serious consequences is difficult to bear, and it might have to be like this for a while, so I don't know if I can survive.

if anyone's curious my regime is the same as before except i'm doing a stat dose this time. i haven't ate since 6am. i got into a heated argument with my dad just now and we both told each other to go ""fuck ourselves"" so i'm doing exactly that haha. i think my breaking point was realizing that i'd never have a healthy relationship with my dad no matter how badly i wanted it and i guess today proved that'll never happen.

anyways, here's my regime :
an hour before i drink the SN

10pm ;; 600mg ibuprofen, 500mg acetaminophen

10:15pm ;; 3 x 10mg meto (30g in total)

10:30pm ;; double dose of antacid

10:35pm ;; prepare sn drinks..need 2 in case i vomit blegh

11:00pm ;; drink sn , lay in bed & die :pp

if there's anything i should change about my regime please let me know, i'll be sending out final messages and such. i'll also try to stay and be interactive as much as i can before i eventually go unconscious. thank you all :,)",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2664554,rotten,"Sep 9, 2024 at 5:25 PM","Many years ago( I was around 14 or 15) during one of my mother's rampages, both me and my dad were forced to sleep outside. This was because 3 years prior to this, I messaged my already estranged sister on Facebook. My parents went snooping while I was at school and found that message. Next thing I know, 5 minutes after I walk in the front door I'm being violently abused. It went on well into the night and then started again at 4 am. By 4:30 am, I found myself sneaking into my school through a hole in the fence. It was cold, dark, and not a soul was around. Needless to say that day I didn't really pay attention in any of my classes, and obviously didn't have any homework done. This was one of the many similar instances that occurred and is one of the reasons I am extremely suicidal to this day.

During the time me and my dad were locked outside, my dad was trying to talk to me here and there. It felt like he blamed me entirely for what was happening and made up excuses for my mom such as ""she just has a lot of issues she's going through"". He also said something like ""You had it all, now look where you're at now"" Meanwhile, he had just been violently abused himself and was locked out of the house he paid for.

But the main thing he said that evening that stuck out to me the most was ""If you want to have a better life you need to go to college, it's the only way out"". I start thinking well why can't you do anything to stop this? He was the only one with any real power to stop this and better the both of our lives. I was barely a teenager and struggling in school due to this abuse. I feel like I don't even need to explain why what he said is so laughable.

Not too long ago, maybe like 3 months ago, I was watching the Danelle Hallan YouTube channel. She was discussing an extreme case of abuse centered around a young boy (I'll try to update with the exact case later). He suffered immensely and eventually died at the hands of his abusers. Danelle went into great detail about how his other family members were trying to help out. She stated that his biological father would talk to him quite a bit and said something like ""If you want to get out of this you have to keep studying and go to college"" He never even had the chance to become a teenager or graduate elementary.

That phrase again…just always rubs me the wrong way. I can understand extended family not being able to do too much, but when you're a biological parent, you need to fucking fight hard for you kid. You can't just put it all on them.

Not to mention those of us who suffer from abuse aren't always the ones accelerating at school. Not because we are stupid, far from it because we grow up quickly, but because all we can think about is how we are going to survive when we come home.

Also I'm sure there are others who can achieve many things under heinous circumstances, but everyone is different. It frustrates me just how many people don't understand this simple fact.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Is that even suicide? I don't think so. I can go really long times with no food but much less with no water and if you faint there's intervention. The trick is to keep it on the down low. My BF usually makes the food and often he doesn't make enough for me. He thinks I'm flabby which is because of a big 90 lb weight loss before we met. So I'm not thin but I'm not huge either. But it hurts my feelings so much when everyone is called to eat except me. It's humiliating and yet I want to not eat. It's ridiculous. I'm going to start a fast and see how long I can go with nothing but water but the thinner I get the better everyone likes me so then if I gain an ounce back I look fat-ter. I wish I wasn't such a disgusting pig but I am. I like food but if I eat it's all that's talked about. How much I eat how I better be careful. My bf told me if I get fat he won't touch me. I know that anyway but it hurts and the humiliation is so overwhelming I can't talk about it irl. It's a terrible confession but since no one here knows me, I have a weird fantasy about dying of starvation and being skeletal at the end.

Death by Hanging (according to forensic medicine),2664526,Marco77,"Sep 9, 2024 at 5:01 PM","Death from hanging is attributable to an asphyxial factor, a circulatory factor and a neuro-vegetative factor.

Asphyxiation factor: the strap, generally placed in the thyrohyoid space, moves the hyoid bone and the base of the tongue backwards and upwards which, by pressing against the palate and pharynx, causes occlusion of the airways. Only if the asphyxial factor intervenes can terminal asphyxial convulsions occur.

Circulatory factor: the interruption of the blood circulation at the level of the carotid arteries located on the sides of the neck (3.5 kg) and possibly of the vertebral arteries (16.6 kg) produces cerebral ischemia with immediate loss of consciousness. The closure of the jugular arteries instead causes acute venous stasis in the cephalic territory which produces edema.

Neurovegetative factor: intense stimulation of the vagus nerve, which runs vertically in the vasculonervous bundle of the neck together with the carotid artery anteriorly and the jugular vein posteriorly, and of the carotid-sinus receptors can produce immediate arrest of the heart with death from inhibition reflected.


Again from a medical-legal point of view, two types of hanging are recognized depending on the position of the noose: a typical hanging, if the knot corresponds to the back of the neck, and an atypical hanging, if the knot is located in a lateral or anterior position of the neck. Atypical hanging is one of those carried out with the aim of committing suicide,",,,,,,,,,,,,

My final words,2368595,puffyclouds,"Feb 22, 2024 at 4:34 PM","Hello everyone,

In 24hrs, I will be pulling the trigger of the firearm that I have purchased. I will be aiming at my brainstem where the hard and soft palette of my mouth connects. I can't believe this is real, but a lot of strange things have happened to me recently.

Since I have no one else to turn to, let me tell you guys I came to my decision. Right now, I'm lying to everyone in my life, telling them that I'm definitely going to live on. But that's a lie. it's weird having to pretend that everything is fine. I feel sorry for my poor, sweet cat. Fortunately, I know my mother will take her in. She's going to be okay.

Let me tell you all how this decision came to be. Like many of us, I've been entranced with the thought of suicide my whole life. Everytime the world became too much to bear, I entered a hysterical state where I could only crave killing myself, and no sense could reach me. Of course, many people tried to intervene, but sadly, help could never reach me. There was always some barrier. Parents forbidding it (when I was younger), cost, and so on and so forth. This is all-too-familiar for most of you, I'm sure.

I met someone who loved me dearly, when I was a lot younger. Seven years ago, in fact, and ever since, this man has been devoted to me. He knew exactly how unwell I was, for the past seven years. Everytime I was in distress, I'd call, and he'd always, always, pick up the phone. He never made a word of complaint. He understood me better than anyone. He understood why it was difficult for me to get better. In fact, we were hoping to get married this year. Whenever my friends wronged me, I'd call him, upset. And he'd assure me how awful they are, and encourage me to burn bridges. Pretty fast, he was the only person I considered to be my ""real"" friend.

Things went wrong, in the bedroom one day. Around this time, last year. I think it was late spring, actually. We were intimate in the bedroom, but he insisted that condoms didn't fit him. Knowing this, he entered me anyway. I was confused. We didn't agree to that beforehand. But he never raised a hand against me before. I told him to pull out, but he didn't. I miscarried. I found brown clots in my underwear for weeks. He told me he'd spend the rest of my life making it up to me. Ever since then, I remember it did something strange to my brain. I remember calling him every spare minute of the day. And he'd always indulge me. Always pick up the phone. I couldn't so much as look at anything without him opening his wallet to get it for me. He indulged me beyond belief. Even in the bedroom, where things got intense. I remember he would call me ""it"", or ""doll"" in the bedroom.

He made a massive effort to get me my ""dream house"". He signed on for an apartment, insisting that he could afford it, insisting on paying most of the rent. I found out that he was lying to his parents (who were financially supporting us--we're both still quite young, finishing our final years of university) about his rent contribution. He told me to just sit tight and not lift a finger while he insisted on paying for everything. He assured me, so many times, that this was within his financial means. That he wanted to do this. That this was all for me, and he was capable of doing this. He endearingly called me his ""disabled wife"", and told me it was okay for me to be sick and in his care. He loved me and our cat beyond imagination.

One night, about over a month ago, he said he'd be on his way. He said he'd be on the road to take me to the hospital (for, you guessed it, suicidal thoughts), and our cat to the emergency vet. I was freaking out, thinking our cat was on her deathbed. He said he'd be on the road in 15 minutes, as he was a two hour drive away from me.

I stayed up all night. He never came.

I never heard from him again, after all those weeks. I was worried sick. I don't even remember how long it's been. Turns out, he left me. We were engaged. I only found out through the landlord when I received notice that he was trying to terminate our lease. He went ahead and told all of our mutual friends that I'm crazy, and told them all I was using him for cash. The only one of them who hasn't turned against me (she has exams this week, so it's a shame I won't be able to see her before I depart) got a phone call from him, the other day. He said that the reason he left is that he thought if he could get me the nicest possible home, without any of the stressors that existed where I previously lived (long story short, I lived with my landlord previously, and she was... unkind to me), that I'd no longer be mentally ill. When that didn't happen, he decided he couldn't do it anymore. He told all his friends I was beyond help, and I was a horrible, horrible partner to him. They've all sided against me. And when I opened up to some of them about the miscarriage, they've decided that I've been lying about that incident.

And now, all I have is some words for internet strangers. His argument was that he could have never told me he wanted to break up with me over the phone, or in person, because I would have ""exploded"". So he just left one day, and never came back. He promised he'd be on the road. And he never came back.

Perhaps you all will think that the relationship wasn't the healthiest. And maybe you all are right. And I would have at least, even still, liked to have the dignity of not having my friends feign support (all the while badmouthing me behind my back) for weeks before they all decided to block my contact. I would have at least liked a chance. I would have liked a chance to try to work things out. I wish he told me, at any point, what was happening. I wish I at least had the chance to right the wrongs in the relationship. But I never did.

Considering how things ended, I can't be happy. I was raped by a stranger a few weeks ago. And now, all my friends have turned their backs on me. My poor cat is so, so sweet. She doesn't know what happened. She doesn't know where my partner went. I hope we can be reunited in the afterlife.

In less than 24hrs, I will depart this world. If I can make a request of internet strangers, please keep me some company while I wait to depart. Recommend your favourite shows or movies. I honestly don't know what to do with myself, in this empty household, other than to just wait for the end. The only thing that's helping me find peace is treating myself as a terminally ill patient, and letting myself be as comfortable as possible. It's pathetic, but I've given myself as much comfort as I can by ordering takeaway instead of cooking (something I almost never allow myself to do), sleeping as much as I want, and ignoring my schoolwork entirely.

Everyone in the world is against me. It makes me sick, to imagine how they'll all say ""oh well, she was unstable and crazy anyway, she just killed herself to get back to you"". Or, ""she just killed herself to cause you trouble/get revenge by damaging the apartment"". It makes me sick. I just want my soul to be at eternal peace.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I had some cookies I baked earlier this week: https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies/

I've been making this recipe since I was a teenager.

I can't believe today is my last day on earth. The world is such a beautiful place. This evening, after the sun sets, I'm going to decide what to do with my final few hours. I have a lot of questions to ask myself. Should I wear pajamas, or a nice outfit? I will definitely make myself some warm tea. If I somehow, by some miracle, end up living, I bet my professors will give me an earful about all my missed work. I haven't dared to open my school email, haha. I went to the ER, about a week ago, after being raped by a stranger, and the hospital contacted my school. So all the professors know I'm taking some time away.

Maybe I'll take a walk, after the sun sets, and appreciate the sky. I'm on the East Coast of the US. Right now, it's 12pm. Sometime tonight, I haven't quite decided when, I'll depart for my final journey. I'm terrified, haha.",2369202,,,,,,,,,,,

Maybe if it was just him leaving me, I could handle it. But he's told all of our friends that I lied about the miscarriage, that I'm such a horrible person. They've all blocked my contact. It's sad. I wish I could call someone, invite someone over, before I CTB. All I can do is just rest. I have very little energy left. It feels like my body is shutting down.
I'm about 35 minutes in. It reminds me of when I first moved out for university. I used to live with three other people in a cramped space, but I had my own room.

I think I'd like to call you my friend, if that's ok. I don't even know who you are. Maybe I'll see you on the other side, maybe I won't. The idea of dying scares me, but everyone has to die someday, right?

I think everything will be ok. The seasons will keep changing and the sun will keep rising. The world is such a magical place. We live on earth where there's oceans and mountains. I'm glad I could have been born. I spoke to my mother a few weeks ago. She told me that I was always ""sensitive"". She's right.

I think I will give myself until midnight. I'm dead-set on catching the bus. I won't be missing my trip. I've already made arrangements. I told my martial arts teacher to call a wellness check for me if she doesn't hear from me in 24hrs. I gave her my address, my full name, and permission. That way, my cat will be okay. She won't starve.

Everything is set in place. It feels so surreal. I feel like I'm living in some kind of weird alternate reality. Everything led up to this. I can't believe it.

Personally—& that's all this is, o. k. is ME: & my feelings on the subject matter. You are free to have your own. I've always been a fan catching the bus (but) for the ""right reasons."" Realize… this is highly subjective however! In my opinion and in my view, your circumstance if it were my own, would be a shitty reason or set of reasons to be doing so (having that bastard do all he did to you & then running into a/or some random rapist not all that long ago). It's no wonder you want to put an end to things. It's no wonder you want all of this painful suffering to stop, it's like being in a life long submission hold. We've all got to tap out eventually. No judgments passed, you have right to make up your own mind you've lived through this / or these experiences & I have not. So about all I'll do then is shut-up, and say farewell to you then. That said—I still think it's a mighty fine raw deal you've gotten. And I know that you don't have to look at it (the situation) the same way as me, or that I do.

Yeah, they're apparently running around saying that I was faking my struggle with suicide to manipulate them. Incredible, right? I can't help but imagine what they'll think when they inevitably hear the news... I can't help but imagine.

I'm okay. I'm going to post some letters to some childhood friends that I haven't spoken to in ages. There's no way they'll know what happened to me otherwise; I haven't got any social media. Then, I'm going to put on a hoodie so I can head out and pick up my firearm. Then, it's really going to come together. I'm probably going to take an hour or two to take care of all my chores. Then, probably talk to you guys a bit more.

Oh I love watching Kiki's :D You can imagine we had a movie night. I don't know if it's the death-brain talking, but I imagined it as a story about a girl preparing to meet the afterlife. It was comforting to me. Thank you for that.

I wrote him a letter. I'm going to send it to him digitally before I pass, as my last action. I've been considering sharing it on here. Maybe I'll put it up. I doubt he'll read it, so I guess I could put it on here.

I was healthy, attractive, smart and hardworking, and came from a privileged background. I have a good family and lots of social support.

I was valedictorian in high school, I did excellent in all my classes, I graduated with the highest possible distinction at university.

Islam is a backward sect, it's CLEARLY evil when you really analyse it with honesty, muslims pretend its not because of social pressure and threat of being casted out or even killed, and non-muslims people (kuffars) are understandably scared of reprisal, because Islam is the most violent religion. It has all this violence and punishments because it knows its in the wrong, otherwise if it was an intellectually honest religion it would have no reason to physically punish disaproval. Have you EVER had or seen a muslim give an intellectually honest argument? Absolutely never personally, they always use dirty fallacies.
This sect controls its subjects by using fear and very dirty psychological tactics, its discustingly evil really it caused so much evil you can't even begin to imagine. Imagine arab countries without Islam. Just compare Afghanistan or Iran or even Turkey when under non-islamic regimes, with today.
Now even as an adult who lives in a non islamic country (France), i will forever be persecuted. All of my black and arab muslim friends wouldn't want to be my friend anymore and would harass me if they saw me eat pork, and my family would disown me. And im a male, muslim women have it way harder.

Unfortunately, that isn't a case and, even on here, islam gets a free pass to criticism. I think that I understand why though as, to a western people who never had to deal with islam, they don't see islam as a bad thing as it doesn't affect their lives much. In the west, islam only really affects those with islamic families.

I'm an ex muslim so I understand your sentiment. Modern day islam is far worse than any other modern day religion. There are so many issues that islam has which other religions don't have. Also, leaving islam comes with massive severe consequences such as getting beat up, getting disowned or, in the case of muslim majority countries, getting killed. This is because muslims have been taught to value allah and pedo mo over their own children and that's exactly what muslims do.

I don't believe in any religion but I would far prefer being an ex christian than an ex muslim as the former can at least share that to their parents and no consequences would happen. However, I'm an ex muslim living with parents and I'm forced to pretend that I'm a muslim. I'm forced to pray 4 times a day (thank goodness they don't force me to read fajr) as well as read the quran and do other islamic bullshit. I hate it, I really do. I hate islam with all of my rage.

My best guess is it is some form of impurity/peservative/contamination that appeared from years of storage, but I'm not exactly sure. Maybe an unknown solvent degraded after the years, decreasing the solubility of N, and causing it to crystalize, but I really am not sure.
Its probably still better to try and dissolve it separately in warm/hot water/alcohol, just to be sure.
N (sodium salt) should be pretty thermally stable, so if it is, there won't be much loss if you heat it.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"N poured into glass, there is some precipitate. How much less than optimal",1914301,Eucalyptus72,"Mar 18, 2023 at 8:25 AM",And if it dissolves what would that show? Apparently this precipitate is formed after long storage. The label tells the vet not to use it precipitate formed.,,,,,,,,,,,,
"N poured into glass, there is some precipitate. How much less than optimal",1914308,Scacie,"Mar 18, 2023 at 8:31 AM","It is given to animals as injections, so it is definitely unsafe if ppt happens. Means contamination bla bla
If it dissolves, it shows there is a chance this might be N. If it is formed after long storage, then it likely means its a peservative/something else that expired. I suppose since you are drinking it it dosen't really matter if contamination occurs. Not like you will experience the consequences of that, lol. Should not be N as it is highly soluble.
If you want to get sciency, and there isn't much information on the solubility of N sodium(assuming its sparingly soluble only), you can add more table salt once you isolated the crystals. If its indeed sparingly soluble, increasing the concentration of Sodium should encourage more N to dissolve.


Edit: A paper says that N sodium has a dissociation constant of 7.88, which means it should be very soluble in water",,,,,,,,,,,,

I guess I would say, if I'm in your shoes with the N right now, theres a good chance I would still take it, after estimating the weight of the crystals. (Just to check if there is even a chance too much N ppted) I would probably drink more alcohol with it though, providing I had AE.",,,,,,,,,,,,

My rationale is if its more than 13g(more than N dissolved) it likely isnt N, and if its too little, it wont matter as much. I'll eat the crystals with everything else, and hope the stomach does its thing if I were you. If it is N, cool. If it isnt and is some form of contamination.... I wouldnt be here to experience the consequences would I.

I got 200 ml, which is around 12 g, meaning overkill. even 6-8 g should be enough to kill someone, which is around 100 to 130 ml. You think it would be fine to testdrink 3, 4 or 5 ml?

Try to relax as best you can, the hard part is done and you have what you need in your possession. It is the moment to breathe out a sigh of relief and enjoy a bit of calmness. SN lasts a long time from what I've seen so you can take your time and do it when you feel ready.

I guess that pretty much leaves me with the options of cutting, SN, or overdosing. I guess i could have some drugs to od on for backup, if i wake up after the initial attempt.

So for the SN, i don't really think that it's possible to get it in my country, also i don't find any websites that sell it, on amazon there's ''sodium sulfate'' but i'm guessing that's not it, also i think anything that i would order would get stuck at the border anyway. I guess it's a possibility to move to another country to do it and get it there, if that's what it really takes.

Then for the cutting, i know that it has a really low chance to work, but there's still people that have done it, it's not doomed to fail altough the risks are pretty big if you fail. So if you were to cut the arteries from the wrist that are easier accessible (radial artery), is it really still possible for them to just clot up after you pass out? Also what if you first cut elsewhere, and then when you start feeling lightheaded etc, you go for the arteries, giving them less time to clot up before passing out? I know this sounds pretty desperate but after failing once, i would really want the next time to be the last",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2663945,EvisceratedJester,"Sep 9, 2024 at 11:07 AM","That's what everyone says and most of those people are still around right now.

First off, you would need something sharp enough to cut that deep.

Secondly, you would need to get through the pain of it, which most people can't.

Thirdly, you would need to get past your own SI and any psychological barriers that may come your way while doing it, which most people cannot. The arteries in your arms are located under the muscle layer, so you would have to cut through several layers to get there (epidermis, dermis, hypodermis (fat), fascia, and muscle). During that process, you risk causing severe and permanent damage to your arm.

Fourthly, you'll also probably have to multiswipe, since you are unlikely to get there by cutting once into the skin.

Finally, then you need to successfully locate the arteries.

Your chances of failing are incredibly high. There is a reason why all of us are telling you that this is a bad idea. You are significantly more likely to come out of this with a new disability than you are to succeed. The process will also probably traumatize you a lot. A few months back, I accidentally cut myself deep enough to see my fat for the first time and it was terrifying. It took time for me to become desensitized to it. I've seen people online who have talked about cutting deep enough to see their styro (dermis layer) for the first time it terrified them and some of them even admitted to not SHing anymore because of it.",2663827,,,,,,,,,,,
,2664033,Sewerslide222,"Sep 9, 2024 at 12:02 PM","I had a previous attempt but i was dumb and didn't realise how important it is to make sure you hit the arteries, i was going for the leg arteries but that was just dumb, i guess i thought it would be easier, so now i'm just trying to make sure that i wont fail if i try again. To salvage the situation i then tried to go for the wrists, and i cut deep enough to see those two long things that are in the middle of the wrist, but it didn't really scare me, i was more confused as why is there no blood coming. So i think the only thing keeping me from doing it is the uncertainty of it working, and whether i have it in me to cut deep enough, if i can't cut deep enough i guess then i'll just accept my defeat. I also didn't feel any pain really because of the drugs that i took.

That is just the way that i think i would want to go. I tried to hang myself in another attempt after that, but it just didn't feel right or something that i would want to do.

Cutting is the only thing that seems good to me (i know it's an awful way in general, but i would just love it so much to go that way), i know the risks of it, i think i will try it on the left hand first, if i would fail and get my left hand fucked, i don't think i would care that much honestly, i had like 20 wounds stitched after the first attempt, obviously the damage would be a lot worse on the wrist, but idk",2663945,,,,,,,,,,,

,2664153,Neowise,"Sep 9, 2024 at 1:27 PM","In another thread I have compiled some information I have gathered about the method. Cutting the wrists can be a viable method, though as others have pointed out it has a low success rate (I had about 6% in mind). I believe this comes from the high susceptibility to errors meaning you can do many things wrong and because the body is rather efficient in clotting wounds shut. But if done right you can pass out within minutes. Here is what I know about this method. Please note that I am no expert and I might be wrong on some points:


Do NOT cut your wrists like they show it in the movies (parallel to hand). You will survive this. If you go through with this method then cut in the direction away from your hand (parallel to the bones).

Look where on the wrist you can feel your pulse, that is the radial artery (picture) https://www.mdpi.com/jcm/jcm-08-01727/article_deploy/html/images/jcm-08-01727-g001.png. You want to cut through that and upwards. Note how it does not go through the middle of the arm but rather the side. I've seen a reddit post some time ago where someone survived with a massive slit (he attached a photo) because he cut the middle of the arm and missed both, the radial artery and the ulnar vein.

The sharper the tool, the better. Razor blades or even scalpels should work best. Though, Avicii also managed to kill himself using glass shards. But I guess you must really be determined to go through with it.

Aspirin can be bought in any pharmacy. It is a blood thinner and makes your blood flow more easily through your body. This could cause a heavier bleeding.

Getting your heart rate up after cutting by jogging on the spot etc. increases the bleeding and time to faint.

Movies display people cutting their wrists in the bathtub. There might be some truth to it, the bathtub has 4 benefits:
- warm / hot water increases your blood flow so you bleed out faster.
- warm / hot water makes your blood clot slower (or so I have read somewhere).
- while bleeding out you might feel cold so warm water is more comfortable.
- no mess to clean up.
But of course, cutting can be performed anywhere.

Downsides:
- It could be that cutting is extremely painful. Perhaps you could numb the pain a bit using ice packs beforehand?
- You can accidentally cut your tendons in your arm that control your fingers so if you happen to survive, it could be that your hands won't be fully functional anymore.
- If you do just one thing wrong you are much more likely to survive. Cutting is not as easy and safe as jumping from a building for example.
- Death is not immediate and may take a while after you fell unconscious, depending on how heavy you bleed so make sure nobody will find you within the next hour or two.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2664223,Sewerslide222,"Sep 9, 2024 at 2:07 PM","Okay, sounds like the most important thing is to just hit the radial artery, i can feel the pulse pretty well. Also if i manage to pass out, i'm thinking of going outside to my balcony when it's like 10C or less, that should also give me hypothermia in a couple hours. i really don't know what else could go wrong than me not being able to cut the radial, or it clotting by itself. i have a really sharp razor blade so it's possible at least, it just comes down to if i do it right",2664153,,,,,,,,,,,

,2656544,noname223,"Sep 3, 2024 at 1:59 PM","I had a phone call with the woman I dated. And this phone call was way better than the first. We talked about meeting at her home the next time to watch an episode of a show. It will be the first time we meet at one of our homes.

I crave so fucking much for a relationship. I am extremely touch depraved. And hugging my friends is simply not the same. We had our third date 3 weeks ago. Since then I am pretty manic. Imaging how we both get intimate with each other makes me so fucking manic. However, I thought I am still in control of the situation.

Today I had my first appointment for systemic therapy. She told me I might should go somewhere else. I seem to be a difficult case I need someone experienced. Moreover, she thinks behavioral therapy is the better choice because there are more appointments possible. Damn, it will take a long time to find someone. I think therapy is useless anyway. Financials are my main issue. The therapist told me she perceives me as very manic. Many people told me I speak very very fast. I also do this when I am depressed. But the therapist was pretty scared she wanted to inform my psychiatrist.

Honestly, if this is a new manic episode the last one was 2017 this might be the final nail in my coffin. The manic episode was by far the best time of my life but I won't survive another crash. I think if the extreme psychosomatic pain returns I am pretty sure I gonna commit suicide. But there is another scenario. Maybe it will be only a mixed manic depressive episode. They are also hell on earth. However, I am rather surviving in this state. It is extreme agony but in the past I wasn't that suicidal during them. It depends whether it ruins my possible relationship.

Something that usually helps against mania for me is browsing SaSu. I will take more often addictive sleeping pills. It is scary how manic I am. I don't think it is an episode yet. I feel too bad for that. Thinking about suicide and depression actually helps against mania for me. We have not held hands yet. My best friend said it is not unlikely it gets sexual when we are at her home. I am not sure. I want a relationship so fucking much. I might even die for it in exchange. Currently, it is pretty slow between us because she is on vacation. And she has a smaller need for social interactions. Still it blows my head off.

I consider to enjoy our time together and then to face the consequences afterwards. Which will mean death. It was so fucking unlikely with my love delusions to find a gf I won't throw that away. I rather die.

One thing to make me depressed is swiping on a dating app. Which I did today because I am so fucking used to it. And I could not believe who I saw. The trans woman I had an extreme crush on 1-2 years ago. I almost forgot her. I made screenshots of her profiles to send it to my friends because I could not believe it. I ruminated and swiped her left which means no. I think I want to forget that chapter. I was really paranoid when I had a crush on her. Further, I want to focus on the woman I am currently dating.

I hope it is not too late to stop a new manic episode. There are many warning signs but before this conversation today I thought I have not crossed the line yet. I have to sleep more.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Well the one thing I always desired love might will kill me. That's kind of poetic I think I played the cards I have been dealt with as good as possible. I am content with how I went. I could imagine I am very close to a new manic episode. Maybe it will be a mixed episode. I still feel massively depressed. This wonders me. In my memories my hypomanic manic episode was amazing the best time in my life by far. Currently, I am suffering. I am still in a lot of pain.

If my manic episode ruins my potential relationship. I am going to commit suicide especially when I crash. I have SN stored under my bed with all I need. I also told it to my two closest friends that my end might be near.

I always thought college would make me fully happy and really manic. It made me a little bit manic but more depressed in the longrun. Tbh college made me massively depressive which I would never have predicted. I always thought after my next big crash I gonna kill myself. Especially, when the strong psychosomatic pain returns. I am pretty sure I won't survive that. Since September 2020 I left major depression. One year I had job interviews which was horrible I am autistic and can't lie. Then I went to college 3 years straight. Tbh it was torture. But it showed me my naive thought in college I would have a perfect life was just very delusional.

If the psychosomatic pain returns I gonna kill myself. After a big crash it is over. I am very determined. However, when it is a mixed episode I am not sure what will happen. I survived a benzo withdrawal. It was similar to a mixed episode. In mixed episodes I am in extreme pain but not that suicidal. I am not really sure why. I think I cannot concentrate on the method if I am that agitated.

I think if I get intimate with my potential gf this break the camal's back and this will start a manic episode. But I have such a strong desire for it. If I have to kill myself for it in a couple of months I am fine with it. Tbh the manic episode is a really good excuse not to return to this college torture chamber. I cannot work anyway. Who cares? I developed so many problems because college broke me further. Really even many somatic symptoms emerged. The clinic staff was shocked in what a shape I was.

Tbh a part of me likes it might be over. I am extremely anxious and maybe this is why I feel so depressed despite of the manic symptoms. I know which consequences this will have. At the same time I am extremely tired. So tired of fighting. I lost. The game was always rigged against me. If love the thing I craved the most for kills me. Well. I could not win. If I crash big time I even think the pressure to decide will be gone. If the pain gets that overwhelming there won't be a choice. There simply won't be one. The pain lasted the last time 1,5 years. Lmao. I won't endure that again.

I will take a half and maybe another half of my addictive sleeping pill this night.",,,,,,,,,,,,

but i find metaphors/euphemisms for death within English and different cultures very interesting, for example, in Irish Gaeilge there is the phrase: ""Tá sí imithe ar shlí na fírinne"" (""She has gone down the path of truth"") this is similar to saying ""She passed away"" in English
I like this way of thinking about death, when we commit suicide, we are just facing the ultimate truth, the inevitable end for all.
In Gaeilge, dying is also often described as ""turning ones face towards Eternity"" and ""returning to where one came from.""

This brings me much comfort as well to know an entire culture saw dying in this way, returning back to where we all came from, that original state of non-being which is pure Truth; the soul longs for eternity.

In the past in the English-speaking world, saying one had gone ""over the hills and far away"" to mean they had died was also quite common, and I think that is beautiful as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,

[ EN ] To go around the corner.
It means to die because you don't be able to see the person anymore once he goes around the corner [of something such as a house].

[ NL ] De tol aan de natuur betalen.
[ EN ] Paying the toll to nature.
It means to die because you'll pay the toll charge by giving back your body to nature after having lived your life.

[ NL ] Jong en oud, op het eind wordt alles koud.

It means to die. It's a mix of two idioms. The first, sound the retreat. The second, two ancient Greeks expressions: walk to the ravens, and may the ravens devour your corpse. Together, it means to retreat back to the land of the dead.

[ BE ] Zijn bobijntje is afgelopen.
[ EN ] His bobbin has ended.
The bobbin holds the thread of fate, twined by the Norns [wiki] who are responsible for shaping the course of human destinies. If the start of the thread signifies your birth, the end signifies your death.

[ NL ] Met de schop op je rug lopen.
[ EN ] Walking with the shovel on your back.
It means to die soon.

[ NL ] Lopen op je laatste benen.
[ EN ] Walking on your last legs.
It means to be almost too tired to go on. You can also interpret it as death will come soon, but is more often used to emphasize that something or someone has resorting to its last bit of strength left.

My plan is to do this when my family is asleep or they are away from the home for some time.
I know it will be traumatic for them to find me, esp for my mother. Shes the only one I dont want to hurt. Shes done nothing but been supportive in my entire life.
Everyone else in my life though, I want it to make them think about what I have done. For some, I want it to hurt them.

I thought about sending a delayed text message to someone I know, that in turn can get in contact with authorities etc...before my family is aware.
Im not sure though if this would work or not.

Another thought was that I would print out a message to post on the bedroom door that warns them about what has happened to me.
Telling them to call 911 and to not open the door. But I know they won't do that and would open the door anyway.

This guilt of how it will affect my family is the final piece of emotional dilemma that I will deal with in my life.

,2662969,FireFox,"Sep 8, 2024 at 3:27 PM","My heartbreak absolutely tormented me to the point I almost killed myself last year.
Since last year February I have been struggling to get over the man I loved so much. I am in my 20s and the man was in his 50s when I met him. Worst of all I still loved him despite him causing me all this pain.
https://sanctioned-suicide.net/thre...-he-has-permanently-messed-up-my-head.172481/

Everyday starting from February all the memories of the events and times I spent with the man kept playing back and fourth in my head. These memories where of the good times I had with the man and then it progresses to everything going wrong. These memories were so clear as if it happened yesterday. The memories still continued into my dreams.

No matter what I did to occupy myself the man was embedded in my thoughts. I stopped visting my favourite museum because the man took me there. Certain events and dates also triggered memories involving the man. Last Christmas when I was visting the markets in my city and WinterWonderland the memories of me writing and sending the man the Christmas card at work kept playing in my mind everyday. The feelings of me feeling sorry for him that he was spending Christmas all alone in his house and upset over his elderly fathers death also kept being persistent.

The man constantly being in my thoughts and dreams too became a menacing presence in my life for which I had NO peace.

I wanted to cry but I just couldn't because all I was paralysed with shock of the man's deception, his mind games and how I was just stupid falling in love with a man 30 years older than me and believing he was this nice guy. I thought I knew what I was doing getting involved with an older man but in the end I felt a stupid kid playing an adults game.

I stopped eating to numb all my feelings because I didn't want to feel anything anymore. The physical pain of my anoxeria made me temporarily forget the man and it was peace. I lost my ability to healthiy love other men because the man made me soo scared to love again and open up myself up to anyone. I became a shell of myself.

Last year December I planned to kill myself in my living room because I finally couldn't cope anymore with the heartbreak and just having a year of everything going wrong. I genuinely believed I was this heartbreak pain was never going to go away. The pain felt like a lifetime and physically and psychologically it was killing me.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2663127,FireFox,"Sep 8, 2024 at 5:59 PM","@locked*n*loaded During the summer holidays i met a different guy and as I began to develop feelings for the new guy I eventually began to forget about the older man I loved so much.

Its my crazy my experience with the new guy. He is 30 years old. The guy and I knew each other because I am a customer at the CBD shop he works at.In the shop we regularly talk to each other and we have the most interesting conversations. The shop is at certain times has no customers so yeah that is how we talk. He looks very happy to see whenever I come.

In july when the shop was closing I asked the man for his number and asked him if he can go on a walk with me. The area has canals and lots of markets.

He actaully agreed. We had a great time on our walk and that's how we got messaging each other regularly.

Yeserday on Saturday morning he rejects me because I pratice Catholic religion when he found out i was Catholic then he began to change towards me. I told the man I will never force my beliefs on him and I am very respectful of other people's beliefs as I grew up with people with different faiths and no religion but the man said religion is a deal breaker for him a redline. The man is an anti-thiest

Anti theism is a philosophy which opposes the belief in the existence of God and the establishment of organised religion. Anti Thiests see religion and belief in a God as very harm and must be opposed. I want to get married in a catholic church the man will not want a church wedding. If we had a baby the man would refuse for me to baptise the baby or if I wanted to send our child to Catholic school he would refuse. For him being with me means coming into contact with religion. I am a Liberal Catholic who goes to church and pray but its my private businesses and I will never judge anyone for not believing in a God

He said he is sorry for wasting my time. I told him ""no you never wasted my time. You showed me how to love again and for that I will always be grateful""

I realise now finding the new guy helped me move on from the previous guy, to heal properly and to go back to my old self again. we have parted ways amicably. I am glad this has happened. I really liked him and accepted him for who is he is such a shame he couldn't do the same for me. This was the same man who complained to me about the women rejecting him and not showing an interest in him. I give himself to him on a plate saying I want to be with him and he says no.

The man had a lot of internal deep issues looking back now it would have not been a healthy loving relationship. The man once said to me I am messed up"" . I didn't care about his past traumas and accepted him as he was but now I realise I was translation for "" I can't give you a normal loving relationship"" he said it for a reason but I couldn't see it.He was attracted to me i saw it in eyes when I saw the last time before he goes on to reject me",2663060,,,,,,,,,,,
,2663785,FireFox,"Sep 9, 2024 at 8:54 AM","@EvisceratedJester The weird thing is I rescently only got over the man because in the summer I ended up meeting a new man and hung out with him throughout the summer.

He eventually rejected me last weekend I was upset for a bit because i did like him but the signs were always there i was never going to be good enough for him and the man has loads of issues.

Strangely I am glad it happened because if I never met that man I was never going to get over the other man. The time I spent with the new guy I began to forget the previous guy and he no longer appeared in my thoughts anymore. Even when I explained to the new guy everything I went through with the other man recalling all the other events the experience no longer haunts me but now feels like just a bad dream where I now feel "" did that really happen?""

Can you relete to this ?

Since last year in my head from the minute I woke up all the events I had with the man I loved I could physically see replaying in my head as if I was watching a movie. Even when I kept busy the events still kept replaying over and over again in my head. No matter how many months passed everyday I felt like the events happened only yesterday. Even sleep couldn't relieve me of the pain because the events continued to play in my head. The events when they replayed where not in chronological order.

For example last summer I was at a really awesome museum then in my head it was replaying the time he looked at me in the office and stared at me as if it was nothing. The events that replayed in my head was the day I was humiliated in the office by our boss who was the man's friend. Physically I could see it all replaying. Another time when I was at a theme park in my head I couldn't stop remembering the time man mentioned he couldn't keep up with a 25 year old woman.

I felt like I was stuck in a movie. The human mind is so cruel.

Far too many people think its so f---cking easy to get over the past and ""move on."" If getting over heartbreak or past pain in general was so easy we would all be doing it no one chooses to be in prolonged pain. My heartbreak absolutely tormented me everyday especially everything that older man put me through. Worst of all the lying arsehole kept playing the f--cking victim and got also the sympathy from while I was painted as an immature crazy woman besotted with an older man. Entilted piece of sh--t

,2661925,Saponification,"Sep 7, 2024 at 7:03 PM","The way I see it, life seems objectively undesirable.

Whilst being alive and sentient, you are certain to experience suffering. Pleasure, on the other hand, is not guaranteed.

The average person will have to endure slight to moderate suffering everyday (the tedium of everyday life; work/school, chores, etc.), yet pleasurable experiences are fleeting and sometimes far between.

The assymetry between suffering and pleasure is evident. Some suffering will be present every day, with the possibility of extreme suffering that could traumatize you for the rest of your life. The person you love the most can die in a traffic accident, be in the wrong place in the wrong time and you could get raped and tortured by some psycho, etc. And what's the best life has to offer? Sex? Spending time with friends and family? Eating good food? These are all extremely fleeting and can be taken away at any moment.

Life seems like a pretty shitty deal, from my point of view. Especially when the alternative is non-existence.

Life is flawed at its very core. Life is futilely satisfying need after need. Non-existence is the lack of needs. Non-existence is salvation from the cycle of meaningless torture. Life is indefendible.

Anyways, would love to hear your thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Non-existence frees one from all these horrors and more. I don't get it why people fear non-existence . Non-existence solves all problems at once and forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2661952,ThisIsMe1357,"Sep 7, 2024 at 7:36 PM","I absolutely do not think so. Sorry.

Whether someone's life is pleasant, horrible, or something in between depends on, well, that life itself. Majority of people likely have relatively good lives full of enjoyment, most of which comes from having a family, friends, purpose in life, and all kinds of different experiences. These things mentioned will always outweigh normal suffering everybody goes through sometimes. The scales are very much in favour of life at this point. I would even say that the fact that majority of people decide to live until the old age kind of proves that point.

I think life is beautiful if it is relatively normal and it should be cherished and valued.

It is only when someone experiences an unbearable suffering that is constant or very frequent, and for which there is no help which could possibly be given, when things are different. This could include complete immobility in old age, severe pain caused by untreatable cancer, horrible depression resistant to treatment, or such a bad life situation that a person can no longer get back on their feet. In this scenario the scales look very different and because the pain may be so bad that someone can no longer enjoy life just like other ordinary people can, non-existence could be a solution for them, but only if they so choose.

However, majority of ordinary and relatively good life should be encouraged.",,,,,,,,,,,,

When you're experiencing these pleasurable experiences you're fulfilling needs that were created when you were born. Non-existence is a perfect state (or, should I say, non-state) of being where you've no needs and thus zero possibility of suffering and no need for pleasure. It doesn't matter how good your life is, it can't possibly be any better than the alternative, which is non-existence. Add in the fact that whilst you're alive there's always the possibility of being put in situations of extreme suffering, and you might start to realize that life is a gamble that can't really yield any profits.
Everyone's view on life is extremely biased due to factors like hard-wired fear of death and survival instinct, optimism bias, etc. So I wouldn't be too sure about that.",, , ,,,,,,,,,

,2662244,Forever Sleep,"Sep 8, 2024 at 2:04 AM","I'd say it was very much subjective rather than objective. Objective matters rely on facts. Does everyone living an objectively dreadful or even just a difficult life believe that life itself is undesirable- clearly not. Otherwise, suicide would be widely accepted and legalised.

How can we even have an objective opinion on life? We rely on our emotions to tell us whether we enjoy something or not. Is pain objectively bad? Not exactly. Pain has a function. It tells us we've just cut ourselves and need to do something about it. It's subjectively bad because it hurts.

But, what we find pleasurable, painful or just tolerable ranges from person to person. If you asked the average person whether they thought life was objectively bad, how do you think they would respond? If they respond that life's default setting is bad, why are so many of them having children?

I don't disagree with you from a subjective point of view. I think there's more than enough reason for anyone to hate life. But, to say it's objectively bad ignores how other people- probably the majority of people feel. If we want them to acknowledge and respect how we feel and not impose their ideas of life on us, I feel like we need to do the same in return.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2662245,syph_ilis,"Sep 8, 2024 at 2:05 AM","I completely agree, and you've put it quite eloquently.

For whatever reason (maybe just due to the human psyche), I find that any happy, pleasurable moments in life are just so transient and fleeting, whereas all suffering painfully lingers. Any moments of happiness disappear as soon as it's over, while all the pain is re-lived daily. At some point it's completely rational to question whether the suffering is even worth the few, brief blips where life seems to be going well.

Personally, I can never remember and appreciate any 'happy' moments. Sure, while I live through them I can feel some joy, but the second it's over and I return to the monotony I can never recreate that or feel it again. For some cruel reason this does not apply to the shittier parts of life, so the natural tendency of living is to always return to suffering.

If we imagine life satisfaction as some spectrum with suffering on one end and happiness on the other, death and non-existence would be right in the middle of that, as it is the complete absence of feeling. Thus, the only way living is desirable is if, in aggregate, the happiness from the good times exceeds the unhappiness from the bad times. I assume for many of us that is not the case.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I think the vast majority of people would not decide to die earlier than they would naturally, even if there was a relatively easily accessible method to do so, like certain programs in Switzerland, just with less restrictions and without the money requirement.

I seriously doubt the majority of all humanity believes non existence is better than life in general. If that was true, we would see a much different world, a different portrayal of opinions in public and a lot more support for assisted suicide. Actually, if majority of people believed it, we would even have euthanasia laws already in place in plenty of countries (compared to right now) simply because of politics and populism taking care of that on their own.",2662005,,,,,,,,,,,

However, I don't think that what you said can be used to conclude that life is objectively undesirable. The things that you said in your post is objectively true as there is an asymmetry between suffering and pleasure. You're also right about everybody having to go through slight to moderate suffering every day due to life itself (and this doesn't even take into account of those who have to go through extreme suffering). However, despite all of this being true, life can't objectively be terrible as most people do enjoy life despite all of this. As for how they enjoy life, I don't know, I really don't.

Like another poster mentioned, Pollyanna principle, optimism bias, SI etc and this is all subconscious so they don't realize they're operating on deluded foundations.

Or maybe their brain just allows them to focus on the positive more. So even if life is objectively more bad than good, they're more able to focus on the positive. So it's like deluded in a way but since our experience is all created by the brain, it's still real for them because the experience is caused by real brain chemicals. Idk still seems delusional and just plain ""blissed out"" on brain chemicals from my perspective. And objectively it probably is but if they're able to sustain those pleasant feelings and motivation good for them I guess.

I've chosen SN to use a second time around after my first failed attempt ( can be seen on my page the story of my SN experience). I was originally going to hang myself while intoxicated with alcohol, but after testing various ropes and hanging areas that could potentially handle my overweight self, I realized that there is too much risk associated with it because of me being overweight (250 pounds at 5'10 height). Because of this, I have ordered SN for my 2nd and final attempt that will happen soon, probably around October with how long the shipping will take. Anyways, I would like to make friends on here to just talk daily with about anything before my time comes, because with this purchase of SN, I am certain that October of 2024 will be my final month alive. I just want anyone to connect to and talk with on here for this last month leading up to my death. If anyone wants to do that please DM me, they are open. I'm just very lonely, depressed, probably and alcoholic, and I have autism so that may be an issue for some people here and that's okay. I love you all and wish nothing but the best for you all, even if the best means killing yourself like I will be in the next month. I'll end this long ass post by saying yet again that my DM's are open so if anyone wants to just chat about anything, doesn't have to be suicide related, we can just talk about our interests or what we are doing currently etc I would love to have another person to talk to on here before I depart.

As for the beta blocker, I didn't use it for my first attempt and it didn't affect me much, the tachycardia was really easy to deal with personally. I've already made amends to the people I've been wanting to, I'm going to clean my apartment for my loved one tomorrow and do whatever else I can to prepare for when the SN arrives, the site says 2-3 weeks to deliver so I have plenty time to clean, make amends, and prepare but I'm mostly just going to relax on my last couple weeks on earth.

I sure do miss IC that was such a user friendly site.
Now that I think about it, if I really wanted to, I could take my loved ones prescription propanolol if I really wanted to not have the tachycardia since they have a 50 mg Rx for it, I might actually utilize that just to make my death more peaceful.

And I'd definitely recommend Propranolol. I'm not sure on the dosage, since different users give different recommendations, and of course the PPH has a dosage rec too. So you'll have to ask around. But the tachycardia is probably one of the more disconcerting symptoms imo, and I've heard it can go up to 200 beats per minute, which is just insane.

It sounds like your failure is from a typical cause, that being calling EMS (either due to SI, or in your case wanting to ensure your body doesn't rot so your organs can be donated).

I wanted to write and share something deeply distressing that happened with me a few years ago.

While I was at a public park that has a church on its grounds, I unfortunately kind of witnessed a person take their own life. This experience has been incredibly traumatic for me, and I'm struggling with the emotional aftermath because i see myself on them everyday. Apparently they kneeled in front of the church and shot themselves on the head. I heard the gunshot and then there was a big commotion and he was laying there with some blood around it, when i saw that my vision felt blurry and i started to hyper ventilate. I went home quickly and tried to not think about what just happened, but i end up seeing the news for it and i think about that a lot ever since it happened.

Since i'm suicidal as well i keep seeing myself on that person, when i'm lost in thoughts i usually think of my body in a lifeless state, by gunshot or hanging usually.

Has anyone here experienced something similar, or do you have any suggestions on how to cope with such a situation?

Thanks for taking the time to read this.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Know that you know you were not apart of that person's story, and if you were it likely would not have mattered. You were just there coincidentally to unfortunately witness something truly awful.
I'm sure they did not intend for there to be witnesses and did not intend to cause harm to any who did. I'm also sure they would want you to try to heal from this as best you can and not have their worst moment affect you, as I'm sure if the tables were turned you'd wish the same.

I don't know what happened to the other person. I just told them that I couldn't go through with it, that if they were going to CTB, I wouldn't do it with them.

And it was the biggest mistake of my life.

In the time since, the world's only gotten bleaker. A few moments of light here and there haven't made up for the endless darkness infesting everything.

Revenge Suicide,2663922,cryptoinvestor,"Sep 9, 2024 at 10:50 AM","I'm sorry to say this, but if she is a narcissist, she will not truly care. She will turn your death to be all about her, so that people people feel sorry for her. It will be her biggest pity party, she will get a lot of narc supply from it. It will be like oh poor me, look at me, pity me, I had a mentally ill child, i tried my best, I couldn't save them, it hurts so much to lose a child I sacrificed so much for. She may exploit the situation financially too; ""please donate to my gofundme so I can bury my troubled baby"".

Narcs only care about themselves and believe the world revolves around them
I agree it's strange but I also relate to feeling like doing it as revenge. But the sad truth is abusive parents do not care, my mother actually wants me to die, she loves to hear bad news about me and is not happy when I achieve anything outstanding, in that case, she wants to take credit for it. So either way, I lose and I am invisible. I am just an extension of my mother, not an autonomous individual, it sucks",2663749,,,,,,,,,,,
processing rape and thinking about the future,2201554,cornicecream,"Oct 19, 2023 at 12:15 PM","i was 16 when i started sort of dating this guy. Only managed to cut off contact with him earlier this year (I'm 21 now). I don't remember exactly when the rape happened between that time, but there were definitely so many times when I was coerced into sleeping with him. I talked to him about it multiple times, and he would be sorry, and it would happen again. I tried to break it off many times, but he implied he would self harm, and he did. It felt so helpless, like no matter what boundary I set and no matter what I did didn't matter, because he was sorry and would do better and it wasn't bad 24/7 since we were happy other times, and my family loved him so surely it was forgivable and there was no point. Eventually though, I managed to feel more apathetic towards him and stopped caring what he'd say if I left. So I tried to not be interested and eventually just stopped responding to him (told him I felt better not talking to him) and he got the hint (so far. I'm still scared that when the dogs bark outside it means he's out my door. It hasn't happened yet though)

Anyway, I thought I was over that. I mean I was free. Logically, the cause (him) of my problem (feeling trapped and not respected) was gone. I thought I had gone through the processing phase. Maybe I did, and healing isn't linear blablabla. But then my last year of college started (which is infamously the most stressful year) and I just have zero motivation. I want to pass of course (I'm usually a straight A student and i still wanna be that) but i just cant find it in me to care about getting there. I feel bad though since we are currently strugglign with money, and ive convinced myself that if i dont do well then i cant get into a high paying job, and if i cant do taht then everyone will struggle even more. I know all that, but i just feel so demotivated. i care but i cant do much about it at the moment. and i feel like a large part of that is burnout from the relationship i had, and maybe im trying to reclaim some time to myself. But i dont know. there's burnout from school too of course. and burnout from interacting with people and being insecure and feeling unwanted. and feelings i had as a kid (ignored, unwanted, unimportant) getting stronger after all those experiences, and ive recently also discovered a pattern with my menstrual cycle that when it comes near i am infinitely more depressed. see i understand the pattern, i understand the cause, i get where i want to be uni-wise, and i get logically that people probably dont hate me. i know all that logically. but i cant know it emotionally.

its been especially difficult and the passive ideation has been so much stronger. im in a third world country with no ounce of financial freedom and i feel like such a leech to my family. dying is never something i would act on because not only is it a hassle to deal with, but i dont want to put my family through that. while i know all these things logically and to some extent know why i feel this way, i cant shake the emotions that come with it and oftentimes i resort to slipping into the comfort and familiarity of thinking about death and the conditions under which i may do it in some sort of sick fantasy

its just why cant i ever set boundaries that stick. why does no one care about how my day went. why did i have to get raped and unable to leave the relationship when i wasnt doing so well to begin with. all of this is in my control and yet i let it go so out of control and now im paying the price for being the people pleaser that i am

sorry if this doesnt make sense. i feel like ive been in a downward spiral forever. i promise im more put together than this on a normal day in front of people.",,,,,,,,,,,,

No one should have to go through this and I commend you for your bravery on telling him to go. He's a twisted man and you deserve better. You deserve to be loved and to have sex or any physical touch only when you are comfortable.

I was raped when I was 12 and it kinda haunts me to this day. Sometimes I get flashbacks and I physically feel things I don't like. But I went through a lot of therapy, talked to my mom (she is my world and the most powerful woman I know), and went on. And sometimes I still see my rapist. We were in similar circles back in school so sometimes we see each other. And today, I hold absolutely no grudges against him. He has a child now. He's working to maintain his new family and overall, he seems good. I'm not saying you should forget or just accept him into your life. You were repeatedly abused. This asshole should be far away from you. My case is my case, and yours is yours.

I'm saying that once I let the anger go, I moved on. Got back on my feet and now live with my gf and our 3 cats. And I love my life now. I still have traumas, I still have sexual problems. But they are much better now.

The anger, resentment and violation are going to sting for a long time. But I promise you. You have to face them. And the beginning is going to hurt. A lot. You'll maybe feel powerless, destroyed, depressed. But as time goes on, you'll start to heal, and become better.

You don't have to feel forced again. Do things at your own pace. Feel what you want to feel. Discover your sexuality and your preferences.

Suicidal thoughts come normally. You are severely hurt. Don't feel weak about it. It's your mind wanting peace. But I promise you. There is peace here. There is someone for you that will treat you good. Or if you don't want it, a pet saves lives.

Not having someone asking how your day was was my routine for about 10 years. Not that my mom didn't cared it's just that we were far away. When my gf started asking me, I just couldn't come up with anything. I gave some simple answers and that was it. I'm sorry you're going through this now.


There is hope, there is space for you, and there is someone who will respect you. You are valued, you are cared. Don't give yourself to men who lie. Find someone with truth.

I'm here for you. We are here for you. And talking about it (mainly with a professional, like a psychologist or psychiatrist) will give you tools to face it.

Scars don't go away. They fade. They leave marks, stories. And they make us stronger.

You are a victor just for staying. You are brave for facing him. You are strong enough to come out on top.

DM me if you want. We can talk more.

Cheers!",,,,,,,,,,,,

Assisted suicide,2662320,singingcrow,"Sep 8, 2024 at 3:37 AM","I was asking chat GPT what they use for assisted suicide. this is what it said.
In places where assisted suicide is legal, medications often prescribed include:
-Secobarbital: A barbiturate that can induce deep sleep leading to death when taken in high doses.
-Pentobarbital: Another barbiturate used for its strong sedative effects and typically administered in a high dose.
-Nembutal (Pentobarbital): Often used specifically in jurisdictions where assisted suicide is allowed, usually in the form of a powdered or liquid solution.
and for injections it said
-Barbiturates: High doses of drugs like pentobarbital or secobarbital.
-Anesthetic Agents: Such as propofol, which may be used to induce and maintain unconsciousness.

How do you think the world would have to change for assisted suicide to be legalised and accessible to most people?,2663522,Forever Sleep,"Sep 9, 2024 at 2:33 AM","I suspect we will see assisted suicide being available to terminally ill, maybe chronically ill people one day. I can even see it becoming available for the more debilitating cases of mental illness. I wonder if it will ever be accessible to relatively 'healthy' people who simply want out. I suspect not but, sometimes I wonder what would have to change for that to change.

I think it would have to be something huge that shakes capitalism/ consumerism at its core. That makes life so miserable for everyone- including the ruling classes and parents that, they start to see the sense in letting troublesome/ burdensome people escape.

Sometimes I think about AI. Let's say AI comes in in a big way and swallows up a lot of jobs. The ruling classes will presumably still be ok. They have the money to buy and develop all that stuff. Presumably, they still earn their money by selling stuff to others. What about the people who can't find jobs now though? They can no longer pay for it- which I imagine would lead to extreme poverty, rebellion etc. In which case- maybe they will start to let people leave early. Maybe they're willing to support a percentage of people with welfare but, it surely won't extend to masses of people. Maybe an extreme global warming disaster or attack by aliens could also make life difficult for everyone.

It's kind of depressing really. Trying to figure out a situation in which it would benefit and make sense to them to start letting people leave humanely. I suppose the scary part is, it could start to resemble a holocaust of sorts. It wouldn't exactly be targetting a group of 'undesirables' but, their lives would perhaps be allowed to become so shit that they'll be queuing up to leave.

I suspect another problem we're bound to run up against soon is an increasingly aging population thanks to the wonders of modern medicine. More and more people taking out of the money pot at the end of their lives and maybe not enough coming in at the other end. I don't know much about economics. Does anyone here? What do the statistics look like? Are enough young and middle aged people earning enough and paying their taxes to support their grandparents? I'm sure the money men in our governments would probably welcome a culling of our old folk.

What do you think? Do you even waste time thinking about this sort of thing when it all seems so unlikely and so far off? If it ever happens. Likely not in our lifetimes. Seems like we will either have to wait till our lives have become so terrible that even doctors think we're a lost cause or, we take matters into our own hands.",,,,,,,,,,,,
How do you think the world would have to change for assisted suicide to be legalised and accessible to most people?,2663527,Darkover,"Sep 9, 2024 at 2:43 AM","it would require a deep reevaluation of how society views life, death, suffering, and autonomy, as well as ensuring there are structures in place to protect vulnerable individuals from coercion or abuse.
A large portion of society would need to view assisted suicide as a legitimate and compassionate choice, especially for those suffering from incurable illness, chronic pain, or extreme mental suffering

As for the aging population, you're absolutely right—this is a problem many economies are facing. In countries with high life expectancy and low birth rates, fewer young workers are available to support older generations through taxes and social welfare systems. If healthcare and pension costs for the elderly balloon, governments may struggle to fund these programs. Some experts are already warning about potential intergenerational conflicts, where the young might resent the financial burden of supporting a growing number of elderly people. This could influence future debates about the rights of older individuals to choose assisted suicide, especially if economic resources become strained.",,,,,,,,,,,,
How do you think the world would have to change for assisted suicide to be legalised and accessible to most people?,2663543,schrei_nach_liebe,"Sep 9, 2024 at 3:10 AM","I think religion needs to be abandoned, which is pretty unlikely here in the US, and many other places. You've got so many lobbyists too. You brought up AI, I think of AI and the death of the internet insofar as being a place where you can somewhat identify content and find things you're looking for, now if you try to use a search engine they're all basically broken because of all the vapid slop being mindlessly generated for clicks by AI. I'm also thinking about the inevitable next financial crash. I think if things continue to head down this road people might start thinking like me that there really isn't any sanctity in human life, human life is an unfortunate accident of nature, there's no point to being here, we're going to continue to get less and less out of life compared to what we put in.

Something lots of people don't realize is that medicine is not chiefly controlled by the government here, but rather boards of nursing and other boards for MDs, who are probably controlled by insurance and pharmaceutical corporations directly or indirectly. Those boards are pretty opaque to citizens and the parasites in the government and on Wall Street. It doesn't matter whether we vote for incompetent crooked socialists (I'm talking about the politicians) or libertarians. Religion is the first uncrossable red line. Socialized medicine just isn't possible here, the country just isn't set up that way. I'm in healthcare, and I'm from a socialized medicine country, it just can't work. The quality of healthcare in America is atrocious and I feel wrong calling it healthcare without putting ""healthcare"" in quotes. But I know the healthcare everywhere else is appreciably worse and even less accessible in spite of everyone having the right to it and it being of maybe lower cost, but usually not in total. I think out of all the systems I've seen and actually used, the German healthcare system is probably the only framework that could feasibly be implemented here, but that's still a hell of a stretch. The US would be better off being dissolved and broken up into independent countries, there's just too much to muddy the water with how large the government and how opposite people's values are, and how the individual states are set up, and so many other things.",,,,,,,,,,,,

After all, in most cases, it takes one to know one. Unfortunately, I don't think that this would ever be possible even if the quality of life of the average person reduces tremendously. At the end of the day, some people are just more resilient than us and will tolerate hardship way more than we can. I believe that people in third world countries go through way more suffering and hardship than the average first worlder but you don't really see many third worlders wanting to kill themselves.

How do you think the world would have to change for assisted suicide to be legalised and accessible to most people?,2663708,Alexei_Kirillov,"Sep 9, 2024 at 7:32 AM","I think there would have to be a major cultural shift in the extent to which we value individual life (or maybe more accurately, in the criteria that we deem makes a life ""worth living,"" which right now is boiled down to simply ""existence,"" regardless of things like quality of life). Two thousand years of Christianity hammering home the point that every soul has irreplaceable and equal value is not so easily undone, no matter how secular your society becomes. In fact, this viewpoint seems to just be getting more and more entrenched because we've forgotten where it came from, and that it is in no way ""self-evident,"" that, like other beliefs, it was manufactured to serve a purpose.

And admittedly, upholding the value of each individual life has served the Western world very well up until now, but there comes a time when one has to critically examine their beliefs and decide whether or not they still hold water. I'm sure many people would perform such an evaluation and still come out the other side believing in the sanctity of life, but many others wouldn't, and once a critical mass of people recognize that belief for what it is (ie. as a product of faith, not something objective/self-evident/proven), it would no longer hold enough cultural sway to impede MAID policies.",,,,,,,,,,,,
How do you think the world would have to change for assisted suicide to be legalised and accessible to most people?,2663860,Plato'sCaveDweller,"Sep 9, 2024 at 10:07 AM","I think first, religion has to either go the way of the dinosaur (an impossibility, given humans natural tendency toward religious thinking even in atheist worldviews), or modified to be less life-affirming. Many religions are the center piece of what drives the average person's view that life has value and must be protracted at any cost, as well as the idea that your life is not yours to do with as you wish. Religion can also be what prevents others from committing suicide, as scriptures and words of priests will tell you that a hell awaits you (Catholicism, Christianity, Islam, to name a few examples). So religious people will do all they can to prevent you from turning your back on God with such a poignant life renouncing act.

Second, cultures need to become much more comfortable around death. Western society, of which I have personal experience with (I can't speak on other cultures), treats death and by extension suicide as boogeymen. Sometimes even the mere mention of these things can be like mentioning Voldemort's name, though with the rise in dark humor this has lessened a bit. People joke about suicide all the time, which opens the door to talking about it more in a serious context. Death is seen as this far off event that isn't worth considering or pondering on; some go as far as to think they won't die, for technology will save them and they'll live forever (some of the more extreme techno-optimists). I happen to agree with ExistentialGoof (a Right to Die advocate on Reddit, X, and his blog schopenhaueronmars.com), people are afraid of others making these decisions for themselves for multiple reasons: One, your suicide would cause them to seriously question and examine their own reasons for living, and they may be worried that they'll consider suicide a valid option (and since suicide is such a boogeyman concept to be ran from, this is obviously bad for them). Two, your act of suicide directly rejects and denounces everything they feel is good. Schopenhauer mentioned this, albeit in the religious context but it's still highly relevant, ""May it not be this—that the voluntary surrender of life is a bad compliment for him who said that all things were very good? If this is so, it offers another instance of the crass optimism of these religions—denouncing suicide to escape being denounced by it."" So your act of suicide is essentially an insult to everything they hold dear, and in order to avoid it they'd rather denounce the denouncement of it to escape being denounced. Three, people are generally too attached to others like family, friends, and pets (though most people are gracious enough to their pets to euthanize them when the suffering becomes too great, fortunately!). I happen to have an idealistic and unrealistic view of love, where if you love someone you should love them enough to let them go. Your concerns shouldn't be about you, as is often the case between two parties when one of them is suicidal (""oh, but what about me?"" ""how do you think this makes me feel?"" we've all heard that bullshit, you know how it goes), but about the other individual who wants to die. If you listen to them and take into account the suffering they experience, you should be entirely accepting and allowing of them taking their leave. You don't have to like it, but actively interfering by getting them involuntarily held, confiscating their methods, and supervising them is not the way to go about things if we are to treat each other as ends themselves rather than mere means to an end. I would never request that my last friend and remaining family stay so I can avoid some soul searching. It is THEIR lives, and I don't dictate what they do with them. I love them, but I would never want to violate their bodily autonomy and right to self-determination. I don't get super attached since this would be a threat to that ideal. Again, as I said, I have idealistic standards of what love should be.

Third, Society would need a restructure, or at least a modification to how it currently functions. Right now, there are numerous reasons besides the religious one as to why people do not recognize the Right to Die. Tax revenue, consumer spending, service use, procreation, productivity, etc. I don't know if this is necessarily possible either, but society would need to move away from essentially treating their population as chattel slaves, and more as free-willing participants.

I'm beginning to lose my train of thought here and my brain is running on steam, so I'm gonna leave it here. Sorry about that. But a lot would need to change for a Right to Die for all to be implemented. It is a multifaceted issue with much nuance.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I've read stories from people here where it feels like there are literally no words to even say to them that could be appropriate. Some of their stories are so awful and their suffering so palpable, it's like, what can possibly be said in response to them.

But when you look at other people's suffering and you compare their stories to your own, and you tell yourself there's no reason you should be depressed, this is literally invalidating your own suffering. Whether you do this to yourself or it's someone else doing it to you, it can add to feelings of worthlessness, or feeling like you're being irrational, or feeling more isolated, or as if you should be able to ""just get over it"" and feeling like you're not doing enough to help yourself, or feeling like you're not good enough, or like you're being a burden on others, or like no one would ever take you seriously, so why bother reaching out for any help... There are just so many negative effects in doing that. And not only that, but these effects are cumulative. They add up over time, and you wind up suffering more and more for it.

The fact that you're here says enough. Please don't add more unnecessary suffering by comparing yours to theirs, if you can. Internal struggles without external influence can be even more isolating as they can't be seen, understood, or acknowledged by others. We're here for you; I know how much an internal hell can be. Our realities are shaped by our minds. External or internal makes no difference.

I'd argue that most suicides are driven by mainly internal factors, and internal torment can sometimes be much more unrelenting than anything external can provide. After all, if your mind is anything like most on this site, you live with your abuser 24/7, and he just happens to control your entire experiential world. If possible, please try to be easier on yourself, at least in that regard. Your suffering is deep and very real. You deserve to have it acknowledged and cared for.

The perception that suffering or pain should be measured by external factors is unfortunately an outdated and ignorant mindset that ignores mental illness. Our brains, which dictate how we perceive, think, and experience the world, are functionally and/or structurally damaged. If someone had no legs or was paraplegic with no limbs, we would see it and automatically acknowledge the pain and hardship they must go through every day. Unfortunately, with severe mental illnesses, this pain and daily struggle are not readily seen and much less understood. Many of the symptoms aren't really conceivable, and trying to relate it to someone who hasn't experienced it is much more difficult than their ability to imagine life without limbs. Often, certain symptoms, thoughts, or emotions are so depressing, jarring, or disturbing that it would be inappropriate to share and concerning to the listener.

On top of the immense suffering people with severe mental illnesses face, what may be the worst and at least most alienating part of it all, is just how isolating it is to have. The lack of understanding, the inability to relate, the ignorance and invalidation, the loneliness… it just piles on to an already awful disease(s). You wouldn't tell a fellow soldier who lost their legs at war to just get up and walk because you ""also went to war and can walk just fine."" You can see they have no legs and can reason that their circumstances must have been different, even though you both experienced a similar event. Unfortunately, this grace and understanding are seldom afforded to those with mental illnesses. And it's understandable as to why; it's an invisible kind of suffering that can't be seen or experienced by most others.",,,,,,,,,,,,

People are inherently social creatures, and while some people are ok to spend it alone, for the vast majority of people social isolation is torture. Being alone for long periods of time, especially with the fear that things will never get better, is extremely traumatic.

It's why I'm on this site. I have severe social anxiety and the loneliness that it's caused has made life not worth living. I'm very similar to you in that there's nothing ""wrong"" with me. I have near perfect health, I have amazing parents who have gone above and beyond to give me a good life, I've even managed to gather huge friend groups. But the fact that I can't talk to them, that I can't open up to them and show them my true self, causes intense pain. And it only gets worse when I see them being free around each other, see them developing great careers and experiencing life, and see them finding love. I'm happy for them, but knowing that there's almost no chance I'll feel such happiness causes such intense dispair. Life is so lonely...

So yeh, I think your reasons are completely valid. I do agree with everyone else here saying give it some more time, I know some friends who were severely depressed and alone at your age who are now experiencing their best lives, and there's no reason you couldn't end up the same.

Is loneliness a valid reason to CTB?,2663568,Forever Sleep,"Sep 9, 2024 at 4:09 AM","I think a lot of reasons are valid so long as the person has thought everything through. Basically, some problems are unfixable. Say, an untreatable illness that will only get worse. Some problems do have fixes but they can be extremely difficult to fix.

For loneliness, the fix is obviously to try and form friendships/ relationships with people. Obviously, that's much harder for someone who struggles with social anxiety or connecting with people.

Then, I suppose it comes down to- how much effort and risk do they feel able to put into it? Are they willing to put themselves out there? Join clubs, talk to people, actively try to make friends, maybe try dating sites? Or, is the fear of feeling uncomfortable or fear of rejection too big for them to get over?

It's too big for me to get over to risk trying all that stuff but I'm lucky in that my need for a relationship diminished as I got older.

I suppose I see it in a similar way to someone suffering with a physical illness. In this case, there may be treatment options available to them, but they may realise that those treatments could actually make them feel worse in the short-term eg. chemotherapy. Ultimately, it has to be up to them. It seems perfectly valid to me for them to think- I don't want to put myself through that. On the other hand, they may feel like it could give them a new lease of life. So really- you could try everything you can to find people or, you could decide that you can't face it.

I think the feelings themselves are valid and I think the fear of trying to solve our problems can be valid too. That's just my opinion though. I'm not encouraging anyone to CTB. That has to be a decision very well thought out by them.",,,,,,,,,,,,

"What is the ""correct"" suicide method?",2652535,FailedMusician,"Aug 31, 2024 at 7:35 AM","These are the three criteria I think are important for an ideal suicide method, at least for me:

1. No permanent damage in case of failure
I remember seeing a (hopefully fake) video of someone who shot their face and jaw off with a gun and survived, turning him blind and without a mouth and nose, and basically visually transforming the poor guy into a grotesque monster. He picked a method that is seen as reliable, but he still survived, and his life will undoubtedly have gotten far worse after that affair, even if he got the correct mental health attention which he may have lacked before the attempt.

2. Light on pain
It should not be more painful than something like a migraine or twisted ankle, ideally it should be painless and unconscious.

3. Reliability
Note, this criteria is subservient to 1 and 2, and reliability does not have to be that high. If chance of death is only 10%, but pain is light or non existent, and there is no risk of permanent damage, the ideal suicide method lets you attempt as many times as you want without fuss, causing you to die eventually through chance. It's okay to let your mental anguish continue for a little while as long as you have hope for it to end soon through death. However, a higher reliability is still preferable and good to know when researching methods.

Conclusion:
Are there any suicide methods that meet these criteria? I doubt it, but I'm curious. I'm also curious what you all think in general about desirable and less desirable suicide methods. I am researching suicide methods that are painless and low risk of permanent damage, because I don't want to make my life worse, and I'm a little reluctant about causing physical pain to myself.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Seconds might ""decide"", if a suicide attempt is interrupted whether we end up as veggies or recover fully.

For others its lasting effect, and in that case its kind of up in the air, considering that, as i said earlier and as others in the thread have mentioned, the intent is to die, so it's not really possible to ensure absoloutely no lasting damage as the goal is to get your body to shut down.

Skydiving. This is costly in terms of time and money. Most countries require you to strap a licensed instructor on your back. So you'll need to take an accelerated freefall (AFF) course to earn the privilege to solo jump out of an aircraft. This course also allows you to overcome your fear of falling under the guidance of certified instructors. Once you've acquired your AFF license, the where is more important than the when. You don't want to land in a soft, newly ploughed field. [wiki]

Death should be guaranteed and painless if you meet the criteria of
… falling head first
… at terminal velocity
… after taking off your backpack parachute mid-fall
… and manage to land on a hard surface.

Of course, you can meet the same criteria under different circumstances, such as, jumping off a tall building. But a tall building doesn't allow you practice jumps. And who knows… maybe you'll get a new lease on life after experiencing the thrill of freefalling.",,,,,,,,,,,,

It's interesting, apparently a lot of depressed people are not so squeamish about pain, choosing methods like cutting your arms in a bath tub to do the job, hanging looks easy in comparison. I really don't get that, but maybe deep down I just don't want to die enough, or something.

I'm new to this, I've looked into what Nembutal (euthanasia drug) is, and the 'experts' apparently agree it's the 'peaceful' method, but the difficulty with that method is in procuring it, apparently there are a lot of scams and fake products out there. I have no idea how one would get the genuine product, one would have to find a veterinarian willing to sell it maybe, but it would be a liquid meant to be injected, and not a pill. But then, I can't imagine creating fake suicide pills is very profitable, not that many people commit suicide and they won't get addicted to your product, so maybe concerns about buying fake products aren't founded. The scams are probably people asking way too much money and not giving you anything in return. To get the Nembutal pills, seems like you would have to know somebody who knows somebody.

I have came across and studied many many different religions and philosophies. I cannot prescribe to any of them I simply call myself a seeker.

Catholicism, Christianity etc.. are some of the most obviously bullshit ones out there. The amount of murder and racism that built it is astounding. I'm not sure how people can even get into it without being indoctrinated from a young age. All you gotta do is research the history and you will be disgusted. Buddhism is one of the ones that are the most sane and even old Zen Buddhism is some pretty hardcore shit and was wayyyy out there lol.

Catholicism, Christianity, and Eastern Orthodox are all based upon a monarchical structure (like the political/societal structure of the time? how do people not see this) its actually evil. Catholicism is obviously the worse the pope is straight up a king and the pyramid structure goes down from there. I believe religion was created to be used as the ultimate tool to have authority - even kings and queens had to kneel and kiss the hand its wild. It was so very corrupt and evil - these evils still exist today but in a much more passive way i.e. the manipulation it still has over people.

Its all based on stories written many many years ago for an entirely different type of people. These religions offer ""relief"" from the everyday struggle of the lower class (majority ESPECIALLY back then) a way to ease the mind with words and ""belief"" and offered the same for the nobility. It's fake lol a tool used to manipulate and guide the cattle. We are the cattle.

I personally cannot settle on literally anything as fact about life, death, the universe etc. .... I don't think I have the capability. All I know is what has been passed down to me and spread to me (thanks internet). These thoughts were all inside peoples heads - the most unreliable source. We still don't even understand consciousness or the emergence of life from the lifeless, how can I really believe I know some crazy ass shit about a god and what happens before life or after death.

This applies to Abrahamic religions. I don't know if suicide is expressly prohibited in other religions.

It must also be said that Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" helped create the belief that suicides would end in Hell. (See the seventh song of ""Hell"". )

Besides- I'd ask them whether they think I've done enough. Whether they think any of us have done enough to make it to heaven if we die naturally. What makes them think I'm a good enough person without committing suicide to get there?!! How flattering they think I currently qualify for heaven.

If it's because I can still repent and find God or whatever. Then, I'd say- God's no fool surely? I can't pretend to like them! They'll see through that. Plus- if God would rather share the company of (so called) repentant murderers, rapists, child molesters etc. just because they belong to the fan club rather than fairly bland atheists who've really not done a whole lot wrong then- their moral compass defies belief. Why would you want to be lead by someone like that?

Maybe it's foolish but I'd like to think I could stand up for my own principles if there is a God. Even if that meant a lot more suffering. Sorry but- if there is a God, I actively hate a lot of the stuff they've done. Why would I want to be in another world they've created? I guess they created hell too but, maybe they won't be running it.

Maybe Lucifer will be more reasonable. Poor guy really- he gets sent to the underworld forever for having a minor disagreement with God. Why do people think heaven would even be all that great if God is so prickly and easily offended? It would be like living with a narcissist (again.) Forever walking on egg shells- afraid of their response if you happen to displease them.

Of course, if it came to it, I'd likely beg for forgiveness. I don't like pain. It's all pretty sadistic though- right? Why do people even see God as a teacher? Sent to hell forever because of some misdemeanor. What teacher stands a child in the corner or makes them write lines for the entire rest of their life?!!

Not to mention that a religious cop out answer for why a suicidal person shouldn't kill themselves despite the adversity and challenges within their life is because that ""life is a test"".

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAB_receptor and https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABAA_receptor

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHB_receptor

'The function of the GHB receptor appears to be quite different from that of the GABAB receptor. It shares no sequence homology with GABAB, and administration of mixed GHB/GABAB receptor agonists along with a selective GABAB antagonist or selective agonists for the GHB receptor which are not agonists at GABAB, do not produce a sedative effect, instead causing a stimulant effect followed by convulsions at higher doses, thought to be mediated through increased Na+/K+ current and increased release of dopamine and glutamate.[4][5][6][7][8][9]'

Sources tend to suggest that it acts on the GABAB and GHB receptor. The exact mechanism of action may be unknown. GHB on the GHB receptor alone would be stimulating, even proconvulsant.
If only the effect on GABAB were revevant, would it not be comparable to an overdose of baclofen ?

A few articles: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4462042/

The karger article (see below) 'GHB acts mainly via a bidirectional effect on GABAB receptors (GABABR; subunits GABAB1 and GABAB2), depending on the subunit of the GIRK (G-protein-dependent ion inwardly rectifying potassium) channel involved, and an indirect effect of the cortical and limbic inputs outside the nucleus accumbens. GHB also activates a specific GHB receptor and β1-subunits of α4-GABAAR. Reversing this complex interaction of neurobiological mechanisms by the abrupt cessation of GHB use results in a withdrawal syndrome with a diversity of symptoms of different intensity, depending on the pattern of GHB abuse. Conclusion: The GHB withdrawal symptoms cannot be related to a single mechanism or neurological pathway, which implies that different medication combinations are needed for treatment'

That's more complicated. A complicated article: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028390814003037
I'm not sure what to make of the two GABAB subunits.

But it appears to act on GABAB, GHB, and alpha4gamma1 of GABAA.

Depending on the dose, GHB use leads to unconsciousness, nausea, vomiting, aggressive behavior, confusion, incoherent speech, ataxia, slow heartbeat, hypothermia, random clonic movements, faecal incontinence, hallucinations, memory loss, apnea, coma and respiratory depression [Chin et al 1998 ; Li et al. 1998b; Li et al. 1998a]. Loss of short-term memory and muscle weakness are associated with oral doses of about 10 mg / kg GHB [Chin et al. 1998]. An oral dose of 20-30 mg / kg promotes REM sleep [Mamelak et al. 1986; Palatini et al. 1993]. An oral dose of 65 mg / kg (5 grams) gives sedation followed by a comatose state of 1-4 or more hours within 5 minutes [Mamelak et al. 1986], after which the user / patient suddenly wakes up. The same dose can cause muscle weakness, slow heartbeat, nausea, vomiting, random clonic movements of the face and extremities and Cheyne-Stokes respiration [Chin et al. 1998; Labor 1964]. However, the respiratory center remained sensitive to elevated carbon dioxide concentrations, GHB does not produce epileptiform changes in the EEG (no epileptic cramps); GHB seems to inhibit chemically induced cramps [Laborit 1964]. In rodents and in one small human study, it was observed that GHB stimulates the release of growth hormone, but weight loss or increased muscle growth by GHB has never been demonstrated [Cameron 2001; Li et al. 1998a]. In rats, the (intraperitoneal) lethal dose giving 50% mortality due to respiratory depression (LD50) was 1.7 g / kg [Laborit 1964].'

First this. Animal studies, what kind of lethal doses are mentioned ? ldlo (lowest lethal dose), ld50, something else ? These things differ per species.

Then. The perspective. Assume that most sources that state a lethal dose for humans give a dose that is on the low end.
For this reason: people usually really don't want to die ! Recreational GHB users don't want to kill themselves. Doctors don't want to kill their patients. I'm inclined to interpret those number as 'dangerous doses', where you could get yourself seriously harmed if you took one that is higher. As a skeptic, one could see that as the 'lowest safe dose' for our purpose.

As someone else reported, it arrived as a solid but liquified after a short time on a warm stovetop. I took a heavier-than-recreational dose and thought I'd report back here in case it is of interest to anyone.

T = 0:00 = 6:00 PM

T +0:00 Ingested about 2 ml of the 1,4 mixed in some fruit juice. Didn't really notice the taste.
T+1:00 Noticed a slight effect: not euphoric but kind of jovial and amused in a way I attribute to the stuff. Decided to add some wine to the mix.
T+1:45 Two glasses of wine is interacting with the 1,4 somehow, but I'm not experiencing what I thought I might be after having ~4ml. I'm a fairly active/fit guy around 175 lbs, but wasn't leveled like I thought I would have been after 4 ml. Decide to wait another hour or two to see if I'm missing something.
T~+3:30 Had another glass of wine, and I'm feeling it more than the 1,4. Decide, admittedly, a little recklessly, to see what kind of dose I need to doze off. Ingest a capful of the 1,4 and notice the taste this time. Like sweaty chemicals. Not the good kind.
T~+4:00 That did it. I start to feel motor skill inhibition, balance is off, and I'm horizontal on the couch trying to be very still. Felt like a heavy drunk. I was worried that I might lose control of my bladder if I passed out, so I weaved to the bathroom. Realize there that I'm definitely headed towards unconsciousness. Feeling totally sauced, I make it to bed and put myself into the recovery position in case I chunder. Out like a light.
T~+10:00 Wake up feeling kind of rough and couldn't go back to sleep. Tossed and turned until about 7:00 when I decided to get up and get some breakfast. Felt kind of like a weird hangover for the rest of the day (yesterday) but today I'm back to normal.

Not sure what it would be like to ctb with this option. I'd probably combine this with another method and try to get down a pretty heroic dose of 1,4. Given that the taste isn't horrible I don't think it would be too hard.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Also as I said I knew a girl who did it when she was 23 years old, you just have to believe me on my word for that (she was the daughter of my parents's friends).

Anyway what I want to say is the VSED in the Netherlands is a option but I am not saying it's an easy one. People who try mostly give up but doing it and preparing it well with your GP and a hospice can help you through the uncomfortable symptoms.

So what I want to say is that it is a viable option and it actually can work with enough care and preparation, most of the people here just try it on a whim in a hotel or at home where they can be found and are forced to eat and drink.

VSED in the Netherlands,2663737,Talvikki,"Sep 9, 2024 at 7:50 AM","The Dutch Medical Association (KNMG) no longer advises against stopping eating and drinking as a method of ending life for people under 60. This is stated in a recently updated guideline for doctors and other healthcare providers.

In the previous version of the guidelines from 2014, stopping eating and drinking was discouraged for people under 60 years of age. However, since there have been cases showing that it can be successful for this group, the revised guidelines no longer discourage it. The KNMG does caution that, for this age group, the process may take longer and be more difficult, mainly due to better physical condition and stronger feelings of thirst, making it harder to stop drinking.

Family doctor Eva Bolt, who researched this topic and contributed to the revision, explains: ""This change is especially beneficial for young people with severe psychiatric conditions and a desire to die. By removing the age limit, I hope that healthcare providers won't immediately dismiss the idea of consciously stopping eating and drinking during conversations about death. Euthanasia is often not an option for this group for various reasons, and as a result, discussions about death tend to end there. Patients may then feel isolated and start making plans alone. Consciously stopping eating and drinking can be a humane alternative for those with a strong wish to die.""

However, Bolt believes this method of ending life will remain rare among younger people, mainly because it can be a challenging process and healthcare providers will still be cautious.

It's estimated that in 0.5 to 1.7 percent of all deaths in the Netherlands, people intentionally stopped eating and drinking to hasten death.

A human should have the right to escape unbearable pain or extreme suffering .

A suicide method that is guaranteed , painless, quick and easy would allow anyone to move away from suffering , pain , torture or problems if they want to

Many people are suffering with no easy , quick, guaranteed way to escape unbearable pain

They made Nembutal, assisting suicide, cyanide capsules, suicide kits, suicide booths crimes,

it's so unfair. some of us are suffering extreme torture or will soon . why won't they let us suicide to escape unbearable pain and suffering? they should. we are all going to die anyway.

Nembutal should be available to all for purchase online with no prescription required. a few clicks take a drink of 15 grams of wonderful Nembutal and all your problems solved instantly and forever , no suffering no pain no problems ever again ... one drink fall blisfully asleep in 5 minutes no more problems ever. see videos below of people Drinking Nembutal

The arrested A, N from D . the only one that was giving people a way to escape torture with zero pain.

And also arrested Kenneth law, Dr kevorkian anyone that was helping people move away from suffering. they are pure evil for torturing people

They restricted SN and in the USA are trying to pass a law to make it illegal to sell SN to individuals. this is the worst country

All because of them People have to take risks with dangerous risky methods that are painful and could leave one disabled or brain damaged but alive

They say life is so good. if any of them suffered 1/1000 th the horrors i know can happen or like is happening to many they would kill themselves today. or if they even realized that there was 1 % chance of that kind of suffering happening to them

Old age is horrible beyond belief. i worked in a nursing home. most people will get very old with no way out.

just one horror out of 100's of old age. there is a very high risk of falling ( not good balance etc) which can cause more brain damage constant pain , and dementia. dementia , deterioration will happen anyway as that is old age. the law of Entropy cannot be overcome . atrhritis trouble breathing are common, needing aid with simple tasks etc.

No one would allow an animal that is suffering extreme pain to keep suffering but they keep us humans suffering torture. and if we say we want the pain to stop they lock us in mental hospitals saying we are mentally ill. no it's a rational analysis pain outweighs any supposed good or pleasurable garbage. who would trade 6 hours of the most unbearable pain for something? i bet they wouldn't but they want to torture and gaslight us.

What don't they get about that we are all going to die anyway. life is meaningless suffering but they want to keep us suffering here for what? to be slaves



I don't know who wouldn't take that drink. I'd rather take a drink than work all day , groceries, chores , take out trash problems stress every day and that's just every day low level suffering that sucks also not to mention the extreme torture possible and waiting to spring

I've witnessed the most unimaginable pains and horrors that can happen to anyone.

Even on this site i've communicated with several people in PM that are suffering extreme torture. if anyone could realize that there would be a 1% chance of 1/1000tht that kind of suffering they would kill themselves today. well not anyone but any rational human not the pro-life idiots. I can't help them the ones in excruciating constant pain i can't even help myself i haven't been able to decide on a single risky diy method



Name one human that lived a long time that didn't suffer. most animals died horrible deaths trillions of them eaten alive by parasites, diseases, injuries other animals . most humans will get very old and suffer even now with all the tech . but they are denied the most important tech Nembutal , suicide booths etc on purpose this is kept from us.

The USA is the worst country. Even now the U.S. congress are about to pass a law to ban the sale of SN to individuals. could be sooner but at most 6 months imo fully pass it.

Almost every religion says ""Don't rebel now and be good. If you work like a slave, heaven awaits. if you rebel and are bad, hell awaits."" I think religions also added in a bunch of stuff that lower class people agreed with so they would be more likely to accept the fantasy.

They hate suicide because religion says it's bad, and religion says it's bad because wealthy people couldn't control poor people without religion.

Also, allowing suicide denies that the wealthy and the government control and ownership of the bodies of their workers. They want complete and total control and if someone takes their own life, they don't have power over them.

It terrifies me how one can feel such immense agony and suffer to such extreme amounts yet not die, I'd always prefer to peacefully not exist than to be trapped in this existence for decades just to be tortured by old age, to me existence itself truly is nothing more than an unnecessary harm that I see as best avoided no matter what.

It's such a devastating crime and unacceptable tragedy how humans procreate even know we literally exist in hell yet do all they can to make existence into a prison where one cannot painlessly escape, it's truly so evil.

I just rewatched Speciesism: The Movie (2013) after a few years. There was an intense scene (16:37) interviewing the main character's father about what it's like living with severe chronic pain (after a horrible accident that involved braking his neck and back in several places and pulling his left hip out of its socket). Here's a powerful quote from him relatable to the badness and incompensability of (extreme) suffering-moments:""When you cut your finger and you feel that terrible, excruciating pain, the world disappears. The world is gone. You've only cut your little pinky, and its a tiny, tiny little cut that in a matter of moments will be done. But for the moment that you feel that pain, the world is gone. All you feel is that terrible, terrible pain. It's the only universe, the only world you have, and it's all yours, and you're locked in, and everybody else is gone. The problem is when you feel that type of pain endlessly, and you can't escape it. It begins to transform who you are. You begin to lose whatever special thing there is within us that makes life worth living.""",2553363,,,,,,,,,,,

Instead of rejecting it, it's a religion that exalts suffering, giving it meaning and purpose as a way to a better life in heaven. Basically, the instinct to go on living is inate in most living things, humans included, so some found a way to accept it.

On top of religion and state, nowadays the pharmacy industry/money also play a big role.

Allowing old people access to euthanasia would reduce pension and healthcare costs, so is good for the economy. Allowing those with major physical or mental disabilities access to euthanasia would also reduce healthcare costs, and would rid society of people who may be claiming welfare support, but not working.

In fact, if we made euthanasia compulsory for everyone who reached retirement age, it would save a fortune, which would greatly boost economies.


I am not really sure why many religions are against suicide. I think the general idea is that religion considers life to be sacred, so by taking your own life, you are destroying something sacred. But as usual, you find a lot of contradictions in religious thinking. For example, Christianity considers our imperfect life in this physical world as resulting from original sin. So logically, with physical life seen as flawed and tainted, you might expect Christians to accept suicide as a way of resolving original sin.",2552962,,,,,,,,,,,
They stole our right to escape extreme torture,2557719,needthebus,"Jun 12, 2024 at 12:55 AM","Poor people don't slaughter the rich because of fear of a never-ending hell.

Poor people labor away in horrible condition, competing against inherited wealth under the delusion that they can escape poverty, because they believe even if they stay poor, that heaven awaits. Why work that horrible 12 hour a day job in the factory if suicide is legal, easy, and morally accepted?

You are looking at this incorrectly and viewing this from a cost-savings perspective instead of from the perspective of structural control. Rich dynasties of inherited wealth do not care if something costs 30 percent more for society or improves the economy by 5 percent. Rich dynasties have created the language used to measure the economy and have detached it from notions of human happiness and rich dynasties that control the news make sure the ""intelligent"" middle class hears words like ""costs"" and ""economy"" enough that it knows what to parrot to show ""intelligence.""

If religion said people could die any time they want, without consequence, why not rebel against the social order and then, if things go wrong, just end it all? But religion says the opposite: obey the social order and you are not allowed to leave your earthy duties to toil for the wealthy elite under penalty of never-ending suffering.

Religion has nothing to do with ""original sins"" or ""imperfect life"" and everything to do with controlling the stupid and gullible masses of people. It tells people 90 percent of what they want and then adds in 10 percent of what helps the elite and rich. The fact that you are even mentioning ""original sin,"" part of a deceptive story to trick the gullible masses, in your response tells me you were raised christian and still hold some of those beliefs.",2556300,,,,,,,,,,,
They stole our right to escape extreme torture,2558243,G50,"Jun 12, 2024 at 10:56 AM","That's a somewhat shallow perspective on religion. Certainly in some religions there is the aspect of creating social order (which is not actually a bad thing, as most people prefer social harmony to chaos). But that is only part of the story.

Philosophers have always wondered about the nature of existence, the nature of the self, the nature of consciousness, the mind, time, space, etc. It is the human condition to wonder about these big questions, and we have a need to be given some answers. Religion fulfils those needs, or at least it did in the past. Even in cultures without money and without any rich or poor, such as the American indigenous peoples, they still felt the need to have creation myths and a religion.

Most people are hardwired to be religious or spiritual. It's part of who we are. Just as most people have a sex drive, driven by hormones and brain neurotransmitters, most people also have religious or spiritual inklings. I suspect that people who are atheists by disposition just lack the appropriate hormones or neurotransmitters to feel the religious or spiritual impulse, so for them, religious material or culture becomes meaningless. Just as for somebody totally asexual due to hormone deficits, they would not find sexual alluring pictures of any interest.

As for original sin, do you know that this concept originated in gnosticism, and was only later transferred into Christianity? Gnosticism paints a bleak picture of the world: in the gnostic view, the god who controls the physical world is evil, and he prevents humans from contacting any higher benevolent gods. This evil gnostic god, called the demiurge, entraps humans in a debased physical world of his creation.

As someone who has suffered decades of misery from chronic illness and attendant mental health issues, I can see why some people would like to create such a miserable religion as gnosticism, because it reflects the reality lived by suffering people. People who have been fortunate to have led a great life with minimal suffering probably do not see our physical world as debased; but people who have suffered a lot may take a different view about the nature of our world.

Gnosticism by the way does not really support the idea that religion just tells people what they want to hear; nobody would want to be told that they live in a gnostic universe. I find it depressing even just to read about gnostic ideas.

I used to be a very spiritual person, with great interest in Eastern mysticism; but then a viral brain infection I had two decades ago damaged my brain, and ripped out all my spiritual inklings. So now all the spiritual books on my bookshelf have lot all their meaning for me. This shows that religion and spirituality are hardwired in the brain, and if something happens to the brain, it can utterly change your perspective on spiritual matters.

For me, losing contact with these spiritual energies that I used to enjoy (and which gave my life depth and meaning), is one of the reasons I find life so bleak and miserable now.",2557719,,,,,,,,,,,

I remember laying down, taking the cocktail, continuing to text some friends and acquaintances for close to two more hours, and then I faded out. There wasn't any discomfort or anything, I was just ready to go and I didn't feel much out of the ordinary leading up to losing consciousness, it was probably over the course of 5 minutes at the end there where I got rapidly more drowsy and then that was it. There was absolutely no experience at all between losing consciousness and waking up in the ICU. I immediately realized where I was and immediately realized I was intubated when I woke up, and I saw the whiteboard on the wall with the date and knew something went very wrong. It probably took a few hours after I woke up for me to remember what I did, and then I just remember feeling really angry. Anger isn't a normal emotion for me, mostly I just experience constant frustration and hopelessness. I wasn't able to move at all other than my eyelids and eyeballs for quite a while after I opened my eyes. I was never expected to wake up, and I absolutely was not expected to have any meaningful consciousness even if I did open my eyes ever again.

,2660022,noctilucent,"Sep 6, 2024 at 5:45 AM","Haven't posted in a while. Hi! Still suicidal.

I know it's, like, possibly the worst way to go, but I recently OD'd on Tylenol for the fourth time in my life due to it being the only thing with a chance of working I knew of and had access to each of those times. These ODs obviously never happen in good states of mind, because if I had been thinking rationally I wouldn't have used a method like this to begin with, etc, etc. Sometimes I get so desperate that I'll reach for a shitty method if it's in reach because the ones I'd ideally rather use are out of reach for me.

Anyways, this time was different from the others because I took quite a large amount and was just barely whisked away to the hospital in time to avoid permanent liver damage or a shutdown. They got it all out of my system, and it's been about a week, but I've noticed that it was different this time in other ways, too.

Getting to my question, have any of you who have ever also turned to a pill overdose in the past ever experienced long term aftereffects that have nothing to do with the physical damage?

For examples of what I mean, after this OD I have pretty severe trouble swallowing pills. My body tries to reject them when they're going down, even if I'm taking something safe, and I gag a lot or even cough them back up. Even thinking about taking pills or looking at pills can put a bad taste in my mouth, make my throat feel full, and make my stomach hurt, as if I'm experiencing what I went through in the hospital but to a very low degree. This feeling sometimes persists all day.

If you have experienced these things, do they fade with time? I'd especially like to be able to take pills normally again, because I'm on a lot of medications. It isn't anything physically wrong with me because I was medically cleared a while ago and my throat recovered already, etc, so I think it's a mental reaction from my body remembering what it went through.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I understand it, they're my parents of course this is how they're going to act but it's ANNOYING!!!! I thought being open and honest with my situation would be a good thing, one of the main questions any parent would surely ask themselves for the rest of their lives if they found their child dead from suicide would be ""why?"", I was trying to answer this question beforehand because I want to cause as little confusion as possible whenever I go. I just feel trapped now since I started being honest, they're constantly monitoring me and even if I want to leave the house I get interrogated I feel so trapped. I don't have access to the means I would need to ctb in my ideal way, which would be full suspension hanging but there's no way I could sneak a rope inside, nor is there anything inside that I'm confident would support my 90kg body weight. I feel so trapped and it's killing me, it's like I'm a prisoner in a bullshit life that I never signed up for. It's getting to the point where I've genuinely been considering just going up to the top floor balcony and jumping head first. It's a stupid idea, it's only three stories, probably like 30-35 feet max. It *might* work because I would be landing on solid concrete but there's a good chance it doesn't work either and I end up in severe pain and multiple bone breaks and fractures. This would obviously not be ideal but I'm getting to the point where I feel like I have to attempt SOMETHING because I don't know how much more I can take of this. I'm turning into such an angry and bitter person and I hate it so much. This is not me I hate myself like this and I can't keep going on feeling like this it's emotionally killing me.

I don't know much about your situation or your age, but sometimes there is no way to kill yourself. That's why guns are so prevalent in people who are actually successful, they're effective and get the job done.

I've been seeking for a ticket to ctb on and off during the past few years. I can't believe it has been so long. Feel like last trauma is just a month ago. Looking back, I could say I'm more anxious when I failed to find a >80% successful rate method. I felt like a piece of trash, like I can accomplish nothing, not even finding a perfect way to ctb.

It was great talking to my therapist and my significant other. They provided collective thoughts on how my past proposals might be ineffective. Sometimes too irrational and not scientifically backed. I found that reading journals really makes one an expert, in any fields. That is indeed some good skills I learned from school.
I also really appreciate SaSu. Out of a sudden I was able to find this blog reviving, previously just lurking on Reddit before it was permanently banned. I am not religious but the moment I am terminated to go on this searching path, I was guided to the right way without too much hard work. Chill off topic section, informative discussion and resources sections. I can't believe I was able to concentrate on one activity for so long, being adhd lol. Yes it's scrolling phone, but not brain rotting. It's with a purpose.

Today felt so relieved. Delighted. Finally got some clue to the bus ticket. I was repeating the website acronym to myself and I finally found it. Yet there is no one to share the joy irl. So I guess I will write a paragraph and post it here on SaSu.

I highly recommend this recreational activity to anyone who enjoys real life treasure hunting or exploring nature. Finding sn website is just like one of the virtual cache in geocaching . Gather clues scattered around posts, think hard, use what ever searching tool is available. There is always a solution to a cache. Solving puzzles are just so uplifting. Super nice community.

,2663265,mrtime87,"Sep 8, 2024 at 8:21 PM","I'm just curious how the SaSu community feels about this topic.

I know exit international won't support people with mental issues but at what point does
anyone with compassion understand that mental health is a major reason why people want to end their life.

I personally suffer from emotional disorders and come off as immature to others, and have ruined my life in so many ways its upside to even think about.

People will say you can't commit suicide for being stupid, but honestly, if I have a mental disorder that is the cause of my suffering, shouldn't that be justification for wanting a humane way to end my life?

For many, even at their lowest points life can get better, but mine will only get worse because of stupid decisions I made in my 20s, which I know deep down come from my emotional ineptitude.

What hurts tho is that when I bring this up with family members, they just brush it off and don't want to talk to me.

There really is no support for being depressed and wanting to end ones life. Maybe I could try therapy again but honestly it's too late. When I did see a therapist in my 20s, I said I wanted to change who I was, and their response was so do it.

For most functioning people, this is a no brainer, but I honestly couldn't get past my own grandiosity and realize I'm the problem.

I know I'm the source of my problems, but at what point do we force people who are truly suffering from mental health conditions to keep living?

Suicide is a tricky subject, and I don't live in a state that has a death by dignity law, but even if I did I wouldn't qualify because I'm deemed not mentally competent.


All I want is a humane way out of my problems, but the topic is so taboo my voice will never be heard.

My family says they don't want me to die but they also don't talk to me anymore, and deep down I feel like he same way about myself. I don't like who I am as a person, and know I could end up dying on the streets soon.

When I bring this up, everyone in my family gets quiet. Suicide is bad, but dying in the streets is ""sorry about your luck"".

I'm not mentally competent to choose to end my life, but I'm supposed to be able to take care of myself against all odds.

That to me is the cruelest twist: deep down I know I'm a broken individual and have made bad choices that are slowly hurting me even worse, but honestly have to hide my emotions because no one wants to hear about suicide.

I just want a humane death where I can stop being a burden to my family and slowly let go of the fact to knowing I'm not liked not will ever be. I'm just a shitty human being unable to end my life because there is no viable options.

I've never owned a gun and I tried to CTB with argon and an exit bag that didn't work. I could hang myself but the thought of suffocating for 7 minutes stops me from doing it.

I'm running out of time before things get to the point where I can't physically end my life, and if I die outside in the winter, will sadly know there were better ways to go than this.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2663513,Forever Sleep,"Sep 9, 2024 at 2:06 AM","To be honest, it annoys me in general that doctors get to decide on whether our circumstances are dire enough for us to be given a humane exit. I don't suppose all people with chronic physical illnesses are accepted either.

That's not to say I don't think there should be some gatekeeping. I suspect it is possible for a person to commit suicide impulsively or while psychotic. I definitely think there needs to be assessment of the person and a waiting period. That they need to be able to communicate why they think dying is their best option. It's obvious to me that you are able to do that. I don't think the presence of a mental illness means that a person is incapable of assessing their own situation. Of course, their view on it could be negatively skewed but, that could be gently suggested to them.

I suppose what I would like to see is- that person being properly listened to. I'm sure ideation can be a symptom of things like depression. So then, it does become a case of- what has that person tried to combat it? Are they aware of all the treatments open to them? Where I probably differ to more pro-life people though is- I firmly believe it should be up to the individual whether they want to try these 'treatments'. I believe people suffering with mental illness should have as much right to turn down treatment as those suffering with physical ailments. Within reason of course- if they truly are psychotic and acting violently towards others and themselves and seemingly unable to understand or communicate, I guess treatment has to be forced in that case. But, for the less extreme forms of mental illness, I can't say I trust some of the treatments! Some people on here are worse off for being on certain drugs. Even some therapies have left some people worse off. Not to say people shouldn't try them but, like regular medicine, they ought to be made aware of the risks and given the freedom to choose.

I hold an even more unpopular opinion that even healthy people ought to be given access to assisted suicide if they can demonstrate sound mind. Otherwise- we're pretty much slaves. If we don't want to stay here- why should others insist that we do? To fulfil their needs.

I know it's unlikely to happen though. Perhaps severe, debilitating mental illness will one day be accepted as just cause for assisted suicide. I doubt they'll ever let 'healthy' people have access to it unless something drastically changes.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Such a compassionate and empathetic group of people, I felt less alone getting to talk about things that you really can't anywhere else. I sincerely hope this site persists despite the pushback from the powers that be, as censorship is an insidious virus and should be fought for those who value freedom of thought and expression of ideas. Thank you to the developers and mods and others who help make this site possible.

My reasons: childhood trauma, the subsequent CPTSD and generally feeling as if I was not made for this world. Having experienced much of what I wanted to and having enough life experience and awareness of what potentially lies ahead to know that I am ready for it to end. I'm too sensitive, and cannot successfully function in the world as it is as a result. The world is full of pain and suffering and inequality, and I don't want any part of it. I believe that this is the path to true freedom from this prison for me.

I've revised my plan a bit as I had breakfast later than I planned. I started fasting at noon and plan to take SN at midnight so it should be a 12 hour fast (I don't tend to eat much so it shouldn't be a problem for me). I am also changing how I am taking the Xanax.


My method:

11am - breakfast

Noon - start fasting (12hrs)

10pm - stop water intake

11pm - 1000mg Tylenol + 2mg Xanax

11:20pm - 30mg meto

11:30pm - 2 pepcid

(In the mean time)

Prep SN drinks - 25g in ~ 100ml of water per drink

11:55pm - 8mg xanax + 400mg propranolol crushed and mixed in water

12am - drink SN


I will try to keep updated as the day progresses. After tonight, if you do not hear from me within a week, please cross out my name. I'm still open to comments/critiques about my regimen, if anyone has any suggestions

One note - I have IBS and some other digestive issues. People have said that SN is not an ideal method in these cases, but I am still going for it because it is my preferred method and the best option I have.",,,,,,,,,,,,

0.20am - Take metoclopramide (10mg)
8.20am - Take metoclopramide (10mg)
16.20pm - Take metoclopramide (10mg)

17:00pm - Start fasting (no more food)
22.00pm - No more water

0.00am - Is it CTB safe now?
- if yes, take ibuprofen (600mg) (could I fit 2mg of Alprazolam here?)
- If not, take metoclopramide (10mg) and try again at 8.00am

0.20am - Take metoclopramide (30mg) + tagamet (800mg)
0.30am - Take odansentron (orodispersible, 8mg)
0.30am - Prepare 3 SN Drinks and Benzo Drink
1.00am - SN Drink (Water 50ml + SN 25g + Propranolol 400mg)
1.00am - Benzo Drink (Alprazolam, dissolved in water, 30mg)

8.00am - Is it CTB safe now?
- if yes, take ibuprofen (600mg) (could I fit 2mg of Alprazolam here?)
- If not, continue taking metoclopramide every 8 hours and try again at 0.00am

8.20am - Take metoclopramide (30mg) + tagamet (800mg)
8.30am - Take odansentron (orodispersible, 8mg)
8.30am - Prepare 3 SN Drinks and Benzo Drink
9.00am - Take SN Drink (Water 50ml + SN 25g + Propranolol 400mg)
9.00am - Benzo Drink (Alprazolam, dissolved in water, 30mg)

----------------------------

Summary, I'm going to take meto (10mg) until I find a CTB opportunity. There are two opportunities in a 24-hour period, the first at 00:00 and the second at 8am. I know it's not a good idea to try CTB at 8am, but my parents have seen me change day for night several times. So if they see me going to bed at 8am, they won't mind. They won't disturb me for at least two hours, I can take advantage of that.

I initially didn't intend to include ibuprofen in the protocol, because I'm not sure it would increase the chances of vomiting. If I add ibuprofen, it won't increase the chances of vomiting, can I take a 2mg tablet of alprazolam with it?

Here is my plan :
8 pm - take 25 mg of hydroxyzine (using it as an antiemetic as i have no other option)
2 am - my last meal
4 am - another 25 mg of hydroxyzine
10 am - beginning of dry fast
11:00 am - 600 mg of ibuprofen
11:20 am - 75 mg of hydroxyzine
11:30 am - 4 pills of maalox (antacid)
11:40 am - 10 mg clonazepam
12:00 am - Drink 25 g of SN in 50 ml of water, chew some gum to mask the taste, lay on right side on the bed, have a bucket nearby.
Unfortunately I haven't had time to test the purity of the SN, but I've read here that the SN from the polish manufacturer BM is reliable so i should be safe.

,2641931,LunarLight,"Aug 22, 2024 at 12:00 PM","Here's a little note about SN and welfare checks, inspired by a discussion I've just had with another member of SaSu on another thread. I think we all need to clarify things.

When I ordered SN a few months ago, I was very worried about the possibility of a welfare check. I'm a drug addict so I didn't want police at my door under any circumstances.
But after a few months on SaSu, I noticed something: many are fearmongering but don't really know what they are talking about. In reality, you WILL NOT GET ANY WELFARE CHECK if you buy from an OFFICIAL CHEMICAL SUPPLIER. Polish sources like A, BM, O... are examples of official chemical suppliers. Their job is literally to sell chemicals to companies, or, if you're lucky enough, individuals.
SN is not a controlled substance (yet). When it becomes one, people could start worrying - if at all, because it's not sure you'll be allowed to have it shipped to your mailbox anymore.

At the beginning of my time on SaSu, I took part in all that fearmongering. I told people they could get welfare checks. Because I didn't know shit and was worried as fuck (thanks to others raising pointless fears). But here's the truth: I was completely ill-informed.

The only case I could imagine of people getting welfare checks would be if DMC was arrested (because he is an individual who sells SN, not an official chemical supplier) and kept stupidly enough all the names and addresses of the buyers, like KL.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't remember anyone getting a welfare check after purchasing SN through an official chemical supplier. Only people who got SN or N through vendors who got arrested and kept the names and addresses of the buyers have had welfare checks.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2652382,Themogger,"Aug 31, 2024 at 3:39 AM","Took my first meto pill this morning at 8, right after eating some delicious fried rice my roommate made . I know I know, I should be in fasting mode. So I'm not gonna eat or drink anything for the rest of today and tomorrow (if I don't get a chance today).

I need certainty that my roommate is asleep or will be gone for more than an hour so I'll just keep taking meto every 8 hrs until I get the chance.

Here's my stat regiment when the conditions are met;
Painkillers -Two paracetamol pills(500mg each totaling 1000mg)

Final meto- 3× 10mg pills to be taken 20 minutes after the painkillers

Prepare SN mixture and backup mixture with my baking measuring spoons.
1tablespoon = 15g
1teaspoon = 5g
So first mix is 1 table spoon and 2 teaspoons = 25g
Second/backup mix is 2 tablespoons = 30g
Body weight is 86kg(I think, different readings at different pharmacies ) but it's under 100kg so 25g SN is ideal. Amount of water is 62ml (some baking measuring cups came with the spoons )

Ingesting SN- To be done 40min after taking the meto pills. Fruit and peppermint flavored mentos prepared for salty taste. Vomit bag also by my bedside so I don't have to vomit in a toilet.

I took precautions to label the SN cups and vomit bag (do not wash or reuse. Carefully dispose. Possible toxic hazard). I'll also be going through the trouble of disposing the unused SN and it's container during the 40min window of preparation(from taking 3 meto pills to ingesting 1st cup). Not sure why, but I just want to.

Okay, I think that's it. Any input will be appreciated. I probably won't be posting a goodbye thread so this is it. Might leave a comment to indicate when I finally ingest the first SN mix. I'll be in the chats or on YouTube for the rest of the weekend

Bye bye",,,,,,,,,,,,

The dose we take of 25g is 8-25x the actual lethal dose, and this is done so that your body gets flooded with SN and even if you vomit you likely ingested more than enough; this is doubly true if you're taking Meto in your SN plan, since Meto speeds up gastric emptying thus quickly letting the SN enter your small intestine for absorption. So if you took Meto and vomited your SN, you likely ingested even more than someone who did not have an antiemetic. And the backup glass of SN is advised just to be safe. So in terms of vomiting, it shouldn't necessarily be a worry for you.

The first two reasons for failure that CantDoIt listed are your top concerns. You may feel the urge to call emergency services since SI can kick in while you're waiting to pass out, and SN symptoms can be scary if you're not ready for them. And if you don't live alone, there's always the chance someone will walk in on you, even if they aren't expected to return for a certain amount of time (coming home early, for example). From the SN successes and failures thread, it appears most failures were because someone came in too early, or they called emergency services before they passed out. The PPH also supports this claim, as failures are generally the result of medical intervention, rather than anything to do with the SN. Failures can also arise from not following protocol as well.

Hope this helps. And of course, do wait and see if anyone who has any personal experience with those things replies to this thread. Information is power.

Proof Vomiting is not always a failure thread: https://sanctioned-suicide.net/thre...-on-the-forum-as-a-cause-of-sn-failure.47986/

SN Successes and Failures thread: https://sanctioned-suicide.net/threads/sn-successful-and-unsuccessful-cases-2023-update.120854/

edit: edited actual lethal dose numbers. Lethal dose for an average person is 22mg per kg (forgot about this, remember reading it somewhere though). So it can be anywhere from 25x the lethal dose if you're very light, to about 8x if you're quite heavy (not morbid obese though).",2660863,,,,,,,,,,,

Personally, I'd avoid any type of food- including candy. I think I'd have a bottle of mouthwash on hand to try and get rid of the taste. Again, not really sure if it would make a difference. Not sure about acidic sweets in particular. They advise not drinking fruit juices with it because of the acids. I think it turns the nitrite into nitrate. Probably wouldn't be a large enough quantity to do much but, I just think I want to take as few risks as possible really. Seems risky enough as it is.

Another thing with SN is that the shelf life if properly stored can last for many many years. Even beyond it's supposed expiration date, as the compound is very stable.

Stability of SN and N
The oxidation hasn't been happening with the current level of exposure to air. The relative humidity in the storage room is around 25%. I might test it again after a year, but at that rate nothing is going to change anytime soon. All in all, as you told me, SN lasts a long while.

,2663591,banger12,"Sep 9, 2024 at 5:01 AM","Tl;dr I solved a problem and resolved some details in my plan.

Please feel free to comment or respond if you have any thoughts about this you desire to share. My response may be quite delayed, but I'll try to revisit this thread within 24 hours of posting. Fuck, comment a week or two or so after the original post date if you want. Idk why I'm clarifying this and putting a disclaimer here but ig this post feels more personal and important to me than I thought it'd be prior to writing so I want some for of human interaction with it lol. I'm so disgusting and pathetic.

Idk how to categorize this post so I'm putting it as a ""story"". Idk if anyone cares either but in case this is of interest to anybody here it is.

I'm trying to figure out some (admittedly miscellaneous and comparatively unimportant) details regarding my plan, and now I think I have a better idea of what I'm wanting. I previously had bigger plans and a much more ambitious idea of how I wanted to go out, but increasingly I'm desiring to scale it down a bit.

For starters, I am 75% sure that I'm not going to livestream my CTB. There were various reasons that I was wanting to livestream it before, some of which attached to ambitious plans, but I have become convinced by responses to a thread I posted on the subject that it may backfire and be both counterproductive toward the intended ends and optically harmful.

I also wanted to livestream it partly because unfortunate circumstances outside of my control I was forced to suddenly withdraw from a lot of regular activities and that caused my unexplained disappearance. Although I hope to god none if these people ever see it, the idea was that the livestream would cause news of what happened with my disappearance in April to reach them. Although idk if anyone would care.

Also there are the expressive reasons for having the visual of my death out there, obviously. But I have a different idea, a solution to where I can express myself and be seen without needing to go to the extreme of livestreaming my suicide.

Basically the idea is that I could actually pre-record a bunch of video diaries, create a youtube channel under my name, and then set the on a schedule to upload after my (successful) suicide. Ofc I'd explain that I committed suicide in some of them, and others would be somber and venty, but it also allows room for some lighthearted, positive and happy stuff to be there in spite of the conditions around the uploads. I could show off what made me happy and what I love.

Yes I know I'm an egocentric, narcissistic, pretentious piece of human garbage for this idea. But it leaves something for people who knew me and maybe some stranger will stumble upon it and find something of valuable or enjoyable in it. Plus, I'm not completely happy and at peace with the fact that CTB has emerged as my clear best option at this point, so I want a way of saying more after death, if that makes sense. Again, I'm a piece of shit, I know. But yeah not all of me really wants to leave.

I'm also trying to consider what I want my final day alive to be like. What do I want to do? Lol. I'm a chronic pessimist, but just because life is somber doesn't mean my exit from it has to be. I could try my best to make it happy and beautiful despite the obvious dark connotations.

Again, if anybody wants to comment or respond or has something to say, please do and I'll respond tomorrow hopefully. I'm planning to take a couple days to a week's worth of a break from SaSu soon so I wanted to get this post out while it was still on my mind and before my break.",,,,,,,,,,,,

But now that I have access to a gun, I have a plan. A real plan. Press a button and lights out. What I've always dreamed of. But I'm still afraid. I have friends that I love and love me, I have hobbies and a family, theres a real chance it actually could get better. Am I just stupid and immature for still dreaming about oblivion?

I don't want to live in this world. I don't want to be happy in this country. I don't want my tax dollars to directly fund a living hell somewhere else in the world just to ""maintain our way of life."" I don't want ""9-5 40 hours a week"" exploitation for the rest of my life. I don't want my loved ones to die before me. I don't want to wake up every morning.

I don't fear the method. I know where to aim, I know that with the caliber of the bullet it would destroy my brain. I don't fear ruining my body or shocking my roommates, or breaking my loved ones hearts, it would happen no matter what I do. I won't make too much of a mess if I do it in the bathtub, exit wound facing the side of the building. I've thought it out perfectly. And yet. I'm scared I don't mean it.

Sometimes I am happy. Seeing my friends smiles and laughs and voices has made it worth it up to this point. I've been stressed, sure, but I've had a cushy, privileged life. Am I faking it? Will I just pussy out, will SI win again? Sometimes I struggle imagining myself going through with it.

,2660039,Holu,"Sep 6, 2024 at 6:18 AM","People with good lives can absolutely be depressed and suicidal. It has to do with how complex happiness, or at least lasting contentment is. It's the same reason that richer countries paradoxically are more depressed than lower income countries. The truth is happiness is just hard af to achieve.

There are some more concrete explanations for this, but they are all just theories, things like maslows hierarchy, hedonic treadmill, imposter syndrome, and many more, but regardless of the why the statistics still stand. As such your 100% valid in the way you feel regardless of whatever fortunes or joys you have in life.

As for the actual SI concerns and unsurness your experiencing my advice is to simply wait. You have everything planned out, which is good, and since you already have accepted everything and your mindset is in the correct place then should you have an emotional breakdown and act on it, you'd still be doing so with the guidance of a clear mind. But all that said, I still recommend you just wait, either for that breakdown, or for such a conviction towards death that you can overcome your SI. Whilst I don't want you to suffer, I also don't want you to make a choice your not at least 99% sure of.

Ultimately the decision is up to you, and that's the beauty of it. It's your life, your death. You choose the how and when, and if your not 100% sure then you can choose to wait until you are. There are many people who have been on this forum for longer than one would expect given the nature of this place, and while they may continue to live for a while, it doesn't take away their surety that they will inevitably die and early death. There are many reasons to wait, and it's okay to do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Terry Davis - A Tribute,2663539,Xiaomi,"Sep 9, 2024 at 3:05 AM","TLDR; this guy built a whole operating system by himself because of schizophrenia which included his own flight simulator, a chess game, a bible, music creator, among many other things (normally requires a 100s or a whole team of experts), became homeless, was struck by a train (suicide?)

Terrence Andrew Davis (December 15, 1969 – August 11, 2018) was an American electrical engineer and computer programmer best known for creating and designing TempleOS, an operating system in the public domain, by himself. Its development was an extremely complex, time-consuming, and unusual undertaking for one person.

During his final years, Davis amassed an online following and regularly posted video blogs to social media. Although he remained lucid when discussing computer-related subjects, his communication skills were significantly affected by his schizophrenia. He was controversial for his regular use of slurs, which he explained was his way of combating factors of psychological warfare. After 2017, he struggled with periods of homelessness and incarceration. In 2018, he was struck by a train and died at the age of 48.

On the evening of August 11, 2018, while walking alongside railroad tracks in The Dalles, Davis was struck and killed by a Union Pacific train. Investigators could not determine whether his death was suicide or accidental, although the train engineer believed his death to be a suicide. The police report stated that Davis was walking with his back toward the train and that he turned around before the moment of impact.

I Hate The Abled.,2479200,Illegal Preclear,"Apr 22, 2024 at 11:30 PM","I actually HATE them. I've never been able to live a normal, productive life because it's always been me vs. them. I was born with multiple mental disabilities and learned from my first memories that the neurotypical, Abled people around me want to drain every ounce of suffering out of me. I would have been better off being born in Germany in the 1930s than in the United States in 1989. The National Socialist Party would have just thrown me in a gas chamber and been done with me. I'd be fine with that. But not this. Not being psychologically tortured by a beyond sadistic mental health system that has traumatized me for 35 years and stripped me of all my human rights. Not having the words ""GET HELP"" spat at me by beyond sadistic neurotypical, Able people just for trying to engage with people and things and just exists.

I'm venting right now because 2024 is the year I've decided to CTB, and I've POSSIBLY devised the dream CTB plan I've had since I was 17. It involved asking Reddit a question about obtaining a certain thing (I know, Reddit is a normie cesspool), and I got reported to ""Care Resources"" for the 20,000th time. It's a stupid thing to get worked up over, I know - but things like that are a way for the neurotypical, Abled little cockroaches of the world to put my Disabled ass 'in my place.'

One of many reasons I need to CTB is that I have too much HATE in my soul to ever be happy. I see these Abled cockroaches that have beaten me into submission and stripped me of all my human rights and I want to see something happen to them that makes them like me. I want to see them get into a hideous car wreck AND NOT DIE, but sooo much worse - have a piece of metal pierce them through the skull in such a matter that they have the same level of brain damage I have.

I promised myself I wouldn't let my more hateful side show on this forum, as it would reflect poorly on me, but I'm just burning up right now. Besides, I don't want anyone to die - I just want them to become like me. I want them to lose everything they hold dear and be gaslit to think it's their own fault. I want them to become Disabled in the same ways I am and locked in a cell for it for a month being psychologically tortured to the point they don't know which way is up anymore.

It's perfectly okay when the Abled do it to me? Is it so wrong of me to want to see it work the other way around for once?",,,,,,,,,,,,

It is nor right what people have done to you and how they made you feel.

You are not damaged goods because you are neurodiverse. Your brain is just wired differently. I wish someday people will think of neurotypical and neurodiverse as a symbiosis to complete and benefit from one another as enrichment. We might not live to see that but I think the base line is set. Neurotypicals can´t do without neurodiverse in society, since we are a lot of times highly functional.

I Hate The Abled.,2480665,Illegal Preclear,"Apr 23, 2024 at 5:33 PM","It's considered a spectrum for a reason - it's varying degrees of severity. I have Autism, but that's not the crux of the issue. I have late stage Schizophrenia coupled with Autoimmune Disease which leaves me with Executive Dysfunction and mental capacity like that of a Dementia patient. I've been forcibly drugged by Psychiatrists which left me with brain damaged, on top of sustained brain damage from being over medicated. Like I said in my post - I was forced into the Psychiatric system from the time I was a toddler and basically psychologically tortured my entire childhood and adulthood.

Just because you are on the functional end of the spectrum does not mean others are, and just because Psychiatry/Psychology/Therapy has worked for you doesn't mean it hasn't irrevocably destroyed people's lives (I'm certainly not alone in that on this board, cases like mine are disgustingly common, especially in the state I live in.

I've literally watched Psychiatrists in the state I live promise 18-22 year olds Disability income and housing if they get Electroshock - and then watched them come out of Electroshock worse and worse until they couldn't even speak anymore and were just banging their heads against walls. I've seen Psychiatrists ridicule girls for being raped. I've seen Psychiatrists brainwash people in real time.

A lot of it has to do with the state I live in being the Capital of the US pharmaceutical industry, so the laws are set up so Big Pharma R&D teams have free reign to use human beings, both adults and children, as lab rats.

I Hate The Abled.,2482515,Illegal Preclear,"Apr 24, 2024 at 5:46 PM","I've thought and raged about it every day for the past 8 years. That was going to be MY METHOD. If you gave me the choice of Legal Euthanasia or a .357 Magnum right now, I would choose the Magnum. It's how I've pictured myself going out since I was 15. And you know what? I NEVER spoke a word of that to a therapist, psychologist, Psychiatrist, or even a helpline. I learned from the age 6 you NEVER tell the Psychs what's really on your mind.

And I repeat, I was NOT labeled a 'danger to myself' or 'suicidal'. I was PERMANENTLY labeled 'a danger to others'. They made me into a f*cking monster, despite the fact I had never broken the law or been in a violent altercation in my life. It extends far beyond just my 2nd Amendment rights - I was informed the police in my town have a ""file"" on me.

Do you know what that means? That means if a gang of men break in my house and s*xually assault me tonight, I can't call for help. I'd be accused of hallucinating the whole thing and sent to a Psychiatric Ward. Which is something that has ACTUALLY happened to several young women I've met in Psychiatric Hospitals. If I get in a car wreck - I'm automatically at fault no matter what the situation is. I can't even get help for any physical issues because any doctor that looks up my medical records will see all those red flags, all those literal hundreds of pages of falsified reports by Psychs, and they'll assume my problems are psychosomatic (happened to me many times.)

So no one can blame me if I don't want to hear how people on the lighter end of the neuroatypical spectrum have perfectly functional lives and it's a-okay being a little bit quirky. That's great for you. You don't have to live with your human rights stripped away because you've been labeled a ""likely mass sh**ter."" Those on the lighter end of the spectrum are looked on as 'different not less' in our ever so enlightened times. I'm looked at as Dylan Roof meets Richard Ramirez. Schizophrenia is a very different beast from Autism. And I was born with both.

Schizophrenia is not only an INNER HELL, it makes the world around you an OUTER HELL. You are burning in Hell both within and without and it is a living scream your throat raw nightmare you can never wake up from until you're dead.",2481913,,,,,,,,,,,

Yeah, I was born with a lot of things wrong with me - drug babies aren't just born in poor urban areas - it's just as bad, if not worse, when your filthy subhuman mother can afford the GOOD drugs. Also if your family 'keeps it in the family', as wealthy families do more often than you think.

Considering every neurotypical in my youth abandoned me - same. I say my youth because I haven't even made contact with neurotypicals in many years. A lot of that has to do with me not leaving my house for anything other than basic essentials for years, but I prefer to keep it that way. And for people who are pro-therapy/psychology/psychiatry - NOPE. We cannot be on good terms. You don't get to be okay with the people who destroyed my life from the age of 3 on and have me be okay with you. Would a person of color be okay with someone who was okay with the Klan? I don't think so. IMO pro-Psychiatry folks should remain quarantined in the Recovery forum. Staying in one's own lane and all that.

Oh Lord Almighty, I know. I was an idiot for even attempting to get basic practical advice. I was trying to find info on firearm ranges on a PRO 2nd Amendment board. I figured 'what could possibly go wrong?' And I still was metaphorically spat at in the eye. It's not even safe for me to go on Reddit, as I'm particularly easy to dox, as I've been doxxed many times over by Kiwi Farms, and I've had that information pulled up by Redditors and have had cops at my front door ready to take me to a Psychiatric Hospital. So yeah - I'm absolutely the idiot there, but I'm getting really desperate to have access to a firearm because it doesn't even scare me at all.

On this side of the forum, you'd be hardpressed to find anyone going to bat in defense of Psychiatry when there are a lot of horror stories here that mirror my own. It's why I rage so hard when Abled folks sing the praises of the mental health system when they themselves have never experienced it. They'll outright tell disabled people we didn't experience what we experienced. What they're really saying is ""I wish you all were back in old school Asylums, out of our sight, out of our mind."" They've built a world we cannot survive in, and then when we want out of it, they want us locked up in cells, forced to stay alive forcibly drugged.

Tired of adversity and struggle being seen as 'normal',2661945,EvisceratedJester,"Sep 7, 2024 at 7:27 PM","I hate it too. Adversity and struggle are fetishized by many, especially in the context of stories of others rising up the socioeconomic ladder. In reality, those who can climb up that ladder are usually only able to do so because of luck. For every person who does the near impossible and somehow finds a way to become financially well-off through working hard, millions upon millions of people who have worked just as hard, if not, even harder than they did, are still in the same shitty situation they've been in their whole life. That's not even getting into the many stories of people who were once well-off becoming poor.

Sadly, people usually just end up blaming these people, acting as though their failures of a poor reflection of themselves rather than a reflection of the flawed system we live under. Then again, for the hierarchy we live under to function the way it does, the true people in power must ensure that we have groups we can look down, otherwise, they risk us all rebelling against them. An entire complex social and economic hierarchy has been created to keep people in their place, causing the common men to become divided and lash out at one another rather than at the people who truly hold all the power.",,,,,,,,,,,,

what's left depends on so many factors, like how much thoughts do you have before setting up the attempt, how painful the method is and how much time does it take for death/unconsciousness to occur

p.s : i think your definition of hope is different to mine, because by hope you mean having the opportunity to turn your life around, whilst my definition of hope is being free from suffering whether i turned my life around or not
so with that i could say it's possible that someone might have ""hope"" and still overcome their survival instinct/death anxiety",2663070,,,,,,,,,,,

please read the rest of this

i know this question might sound stupid, but i wanted to see if anyone else felt the way that i do. also, it's a weird thing to talk about anywhere else.

i've stated it a million times, but i genuinely don't want to die. all of my previous attempts and plans to ctb were never about me wanting to die—it's about me needing to die. there's just no way for me to be happy in this life. i want to live a long life that's full of love and happiness, and i wouldn't even be on this site if i believed that was possible. that's one of the reasons why ctb has been a difficult thing for me to do. i don't want to die, i need to. i can't be miserable for the rest of my life, but there's nothing but misery in my future, so i need to die. i'll probably want to die someday, i dunno.

i've heard a lot of people say that they don't want to live. regardless of their pain and struggles, they don't want to be alive because they simply have no interest in living. that's understable, i'm not dismissing anyone who feels this way. you shouldn't have to live if you don't want to, even if your life is great in general.

so, yeah, i'm just wondering which side everyone falls on, if any.

I like sleep, as it's generally a nice break from living. ""Living is a sickness to which sleep provides relief every 16 hours. It's a palliative. Death is the cure"", a bit from Nicolas Chamfort.

I've had lots of therapy for almost 30 years and it hasn't helped (not the same therapist). I've tried medication and the last psychiatrist said she didn't think new meds would help. I actually appreciated her being honest. It's not a chemical imbalance in my brain so drugs won't help. I've suspected this for a long time. I've got borderline personality disorder, social anxiety, MDD, bulimia, alcoholism and addicted to hard substances (the latter 2 have only developed in the last year. The others 20+) I'm not young. I'm in my early 40s. Not married, no kids, live with my mom still. Each passing year, it gets harder to see things truly improving.
I am lucky to say I do have some people in my life who are good. I don't want to leave them. But they can't help. They try as best they can.
One part of me is still really holding on to that every so tiny piece of hope. The other is very tired, very lonely, very overwhelmed by the negative thoughts in my head.
Also... I'm scared. Scared of what happens when you die... no one knows what really happens. I'm worried how it will effect those left behind. My one friend CTB in Feb 2022.... I know how it effected me. And the guilt I felt about not being able to do more is part of why I'm in this place today. I know... I know... in the end, it is someone's choice if they CTB or not... and I won't be around to know if they do. After he died... I never, ever wanted to put anyone through what I went through and what his family went through (and the train conductor) But here I am.

do you *want* to die?,2659678,pain6batch9,"Sep 5, 2024 at 8:25 PM","I don't want to die. I determined a long time ago that I would be the great undecided. I realise nobody will get this, but I'll try and explain it anyway. Here goes.

I have uncontrollable suicidal ideations. They come from the OCD so I'm told. I have depression as well. I don't want to die, I want to live. But, I want the thoughts to stop, and they will not.

So, I've developed a sense of fatalist determinism. (Maybe not in its original definition.) I've decided that if I live, I shall try to make the very best of the limited skills I have to make a difference in the world. As well as trying to fight back the demons of my own mental health. But, if death comes, in whatever form, I will not avoid it.

For example: Late one night, four guys pull up next to me in a car. They ask for directions to Buckingham Palace, which, being from London I was able to give. After a couple of tries at explaining the route, they asked if I could get in the car with them and show them the way. Now, I'm not John Wick, but I know most of the time I'm able to defend myself, being as I am, a vicious little c••t in a fight. And, I was going that way anyway, so I figured what the hell. Long story short, we ended up at the Palace. That's when the driver 'admitted' he was a terrorist and was going to blow up the car we were sitting in. The other three were silent. For a second, deep in my mind, panic begun to grip me. Then, in that moment, I released all my anger and fear. I simply said, 'Well, when you gotta go…'

The car irrupted into a cacophony of raging laughter at that point. Yeah, great joke guys thanks. Actually, the driver gave me his scarf as a kind of reward. It was cold that night.

But I achieved, in that moment, a weird zen like calmness. It's a philosophy I try to maintain to this day. That careful balance between survival and fatalism. I know this might not make sense. In any case, to answer your question, I don't want to die. But if death comes, or my mind breaks, I won't necessarily lament leaving this realm.",,,,,,,,,,,,

From everything I've reading, a DNR only saves you from CPR (I guess that might be enough if you're already choking on your own vomit) but there's no way to prevent being administered Narcan.

,2663213,EvisceratedJester,"Sep 8, 2024 at 7:32 PM","No, not really. At least from what I've gathered, the cognitive abilities of infants are severely underestimated and they aren't just little mindless machines. For example, a study looking at 3-month-olds found that they seem to potentially have a basic sense of morality. In the study, they had infants look at a little puppet show involving a circle trying to get up the hill. They had them become habituated to the scene and would then show them two different scenarios. In one scenario, one of the puppets (either a square or triangle puppet) would help the circle up the hill, while the other puppet would push them down. They would then have their caregiver cover their eyes and bring out the triangle and square puppets and the babies would typically choose to stare at the ""good puppet"" over the ""bad one"". This was found not to be impacted by which shaped puppet they used for which role either.

Another example of this is shown when looking at how infants part take in their development. A caregiver can do something, but the infant or child is the one who chooses to engage with said stimuli. Infants will even sometimes encourage their parents to perform certain actions that please them. For example, take how infants tend to react positively to infant-directed speech and how that encourages their caregiver to speak to them in that particular way.

I feel like acting as though we start as blank slates is too simplistic and doesn't reflect how complex our development is throughout infancy and early childhood.",2663059,,,,,,,,,,,
,2662384,lawlietsph,"Sep 8, 2024 at 5:23 AM","Hey guys, I just need someone to listen because I'm so alone.
So I am a 28 yrs old female, and I still live with my mother.
I am struggling with finding work since the age of 20. I've got accepted to college, but never went because I couldn't get out of bed, I just wanted to die. Ever since then I am struggling.
Somehow I managed to build an online store from scratch, but that is ended up failing too. I've had no idea what I was doing. A year ago I managed to find a part time job in online marketing, but I hate my ""boss"" with a passion and the money is barely enough, it is basically enough to pay my debt in tiny parts. I have $700 healthcare debt which maybe doesn't seem too much, but the country I live in it is too much. In august I made $80 with the part-time job... So basically I have no idea how to stay alive at this point, I can't buy proper food or anything anymore.
All I do is looking for remote jobs, but there's barely any. I keep applying without any success.
This is another thing, I simply cannot work in a regular 9-5. I am 100% sure I have undiagnosed autism -light, smells, talking, noises and people in general are just too much for me. I live in a small village, 1 hour away from the nearest city. It means I would have to travel 2 hours a day on top of the 8 hours work, and I am just completely unable to do it. I don't know how to explain this, but my body and my brain is just shutting down. I've tried it in the past, but after working for a week in a supermarket I was just dead. Mentally dead, suicidal, aggressive, just completely dead. I have no idea what to do anymore.
In this country home office is not such a popular thing, only for really smart people. I am not smart, most of the job titles I can't even understand, because it is written in english. My english is not so good as you can see, I'm not good in anything really. All I do is try, try, try, try, but nothing ever gets better. My family is toxic. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful for being able to live with my mother and stuff, but she is sooooo toxic too, I can't even explain. She used to beat the shit out of me and my sister, and other times she was giving us the silent treatment - not talking to us for weeks. I was just a child, I needed my mom and she refused to talk to me. My father is a narcissist, he lives around but barely cares about me. My sister is successful in her job and all, she has BPD and tend to be extremely narcissistic as well.
I have a lot of trauma from childhood, I can barely stay alive and go on with the days. All I want to do is die.
And I can't help but feel like death is the only option left for me. I would rather hang myself than to go work for someone else, just so I can buy basic needs and not starve to death.
I don't know, I would be happy with anything at this point, I don't have such big dreams, I just want to move out and be alone.
It all seems like something I could never reach. The more I try and the more cv-s I send, the more I realize that I simply don't have a place in this world.
There's not a single soul who cares. I've never had friends or anything. Nobody cares and the world would be so much better without me. I know I am just a pain in the ass for my mother too. After all, she has to pay for my food and other stuff too.
I feel extremely guilty, but I just cannot function in society... I could go and work in a factory for a little bit more money, but it would cost me everything. I would die from being overstimulated. I have no idea what to do anymore. And I try and try so hard, but it just never gets better. Soon I'll be 30, I don't even want to think about that. I am so fucking alone.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I too have Aspergers so I also have the light, noise etc. problems, we currently have another and hopefully last heatwave where I live and right now it´s so bright outside and it makes me overstimulated so it´s hard to just sit and chill at the PC, like I can´t watch dark videos or play games because of the stupid sun it´s also boiling despite I am sitting in front of a fan, can´t wait till the Autumn weather finally arrives.

It really seems like you have tried a lot more than most, I certainly never had a business but it must also be a defeat when losing it, and I understand where you are coming from about work, I also tried working in a supermarket last year for 4 weeks and it was only 2 hours 2 times a week but like you I get easily overstimulated which I am getting better at noticing so when my nervous system get overstimulated I have to take a break even from things I want to do e.g. gaming because my body just need to sit and rest and it sucks it feels like I am 80 years old I shouldn´t feel like this at my age everyone else my age has the energy of their age but I don´t I get easily overstimulated and it sucks.

And I am sorry to hear about you don´t have any friends or never had that is horrible life is so much better with friends although I don´t have any anymore but I know how great it was to have. And also horrible you have such a bad relationship with family it makes me sad when I read from people on this forum that there are people here many people in fact that has no one who cares about them no family or friends everyone should have someone who cares unfortunately life isn´t fair.

Something that doesn't require decision making, talking to others and HUUUGE responsibility. But I can't find one like this, at least not in my country.

But my true passion is animals, horses, psichologycal things. I thought about working around horses, but physically I'm not strong enough to carry all the heavy stuff.
Yes I can understand you. To be honest I didn't know for the longest time what the hell is wrong with me. I never understood why noises are hurting me physically, or why do I hate to be touched even just a tiny bit, etc... It really sucks, because you just feel constantly tired and taking the bus is such a huge task, almost like climbing a huge mountain. I mean how can you even function like this?
Sometimes I think about if I were to live in a city and maybe I could go to work by a 10 minute walk or something, it would be somewhat easier. I don't know... I just don't want to communicate, I hate to talk and I hate to forcing myself to look the other person in the eye. It is tiring.

Something I forgot to mention in the original post is that recently (well 2 months ago) I was diagnosed with Lyme disease. Now I live with constant muscle and joint pains and an overall awful feeling in my body.

I live in a bigger city now I used to live in a small town so it´s nice everything is close and the exposure for more people and vehichles has also made it easier to tolerate those things when going back to smaller towns then it seems like there is almost nothing.

That is horrible you got that decease is there anything the doctors can do about it with medicine I know nothing about that decease but despite that I just thought I would mention since another member recently mentioned it to me with my severe allergy problems that maybe the carnivore or lion diet would help which Mikhaila Peterson talks a lot about on her YouTube channel it has helped her mom with lyme decease if I remember correctly I can´t remember by how much I am currently trying to ease into it and give life another big try, not trying to preach to you btw just thought I would throw it out there since I just got told about it.

I also forgot to mention before I am 30 years old so close to you yet feels like an eternity from being in my 20´s at 29 to 30 I hate it so much so I understand why you dread it so did I as the years crept closer to the 30 and it´s hard to accept that I wasted my 20´s being sick in both my body and mind, it´s the time everyone makes there great memories for life thinking back on partying, traveling making new friends and living life but I have been sick throughout my 20´s so I missed out on that.",2662431,,,,,,,,,,,

Age is just a number, I feel like I am 70 years old, I cannot do it. I cannot even imagine myself being around other people. I too can understand that I'm weird, off, depressed and clumsy in hiding it. I realize that I don't actually want to work; I want a way to stop being a burden, perhaps something to get my mind away from suffering. The routine is scary. The people are scary. The fact that I would have to do it every day is scary. If I don't, I'll get yelled at - rightfully so, but I cannot have that, there is only so much I can handle. I wish I could go back to being young; at least then I didn't have feel ashamed about not doing anything. A sick child is to be tended to. A sick adult is a leech, a burden, God knows.

I'm a bum, I hate the idea of work, I hate the people, I hate myself, I hate everything but the fact that it may make you feel independent. But at what cost? Taking all of that into consideration, the chances of me performing actually exist; they are right next to none.

I, more frequently than I would like, keep searching for people who ctb. David Foster Wallace, Mark Fisher, Rudolf Wittgenstein, to cite a few. Of course, there is an abundance of info of people who ctbed, including my knowledge of those on my DMs. But the info of how they really thought and what they would say of their own condition is far rarer. I keep unconsciously trying to understand them... to know if they felt something akin of what I feel. The confusion, the internal struggle... the pain, the unfairness of it all... the intensity of it all. But after taking to more people than I probably should about my problems I know I could never understand them. I have talked to too much ""sick people as me"" to know that every personal impulse towards death, though similar in some things, is vastly unique. Which, in retrospect, is obvious. Although we are similar in superficial aspects, when you dive deeper, you start to find the incongruities. And this also ends up being not very helpful when I try to find a way to be less lost about my death when I look at them. I keep having this indecisiveness... and also this constant emptying of self due to the severe depression. I can't think straight, I can't live straight. It seems like I am always carrying weights among all my limbs. I barely can write sometimes. The last guy I spoke to said he didn't feel depressed or ""disabled"" by some depression, and yet he had his problems and pains. He's dead now. Again, I guess it's different for everyone. I have this desire to be understood... I wish my parents knew what I go through... I've tried to tell them, however, if even the ones here don't totally get how I feel, imagine my parents. Suicide is such a foreign concept for some people... its really interesting how some people think of it all the time and for other people, the thought never crosses their mind.

Are you happy with your social and/or family situation?
Are you happy in your relationship or happy not being in a relationship?

I'll admit to being wrong only if someone suicidal can honestly answer ""yes"" to all of the above.

the only one i will admit to not meeting is #5. but thats because it's a tautology. you can't be feeling good mentally AND be suicidal unless you're suicidal for some external reason, like a threat to your family (as per action movies). being suicidal is inherently not doing well mentally.

that being said though, whether or not someone is ""feeling good mentally"" is kinda the biggest question in the right to die movement. because people will always claim that, if youre suicidal, you cant be trusted to assess yourself. which means only non suicidal people get to assess themselves. which leads to a selection bias.

also, whether or not somebody feels good mentally is often less about how much effort they have put into mental health care, and is more about how much access to resources they have. personally, when i talk to a therapist and say im suicidal, they put me in a psych ward, which traumatizes me and provides no therapeutic benefit other than keeping me in a room where i can be monitored to make sure im not being self injurious. it does nothing to improve my mental state. it's a holding cell. it's intended to get impulsively suicidal people to come down from their impulses. and then, once i leave the psych ward, i go back to my therapist and share that im still suicidal, and they rehospitalize me. it becomes cyclical. three therapists have done this. and i still have nightmares from the psych wards. theyre horrible. i didnt have violent thoughts about other people until i got out of the psych ward and found it hard to cope with the trauma. theyve worsened my mental state to the point that my suicidality is no longer a desire, it's a need.

ive been suicidal for over a decade now, and have made many suicide attempts throughout that decade. but if youre about to suggest me some new treatment, ive likely already tried it. CBT, DBT, ACT, ERT, Hypno-therapy, and more. this system of medicine isn't made for me because it refuses to treat my suicidality in its own right. it only treats it as a symptom of depression and insists that solving my depression will solve my suicidality. my worst attempt was while maxed out on anti depressants with a therapist of 3 years meeting weekly with me about my depression. depression has truly nothing to do with it, i can be happy as a clam and still want to die. and if therapists refuse to hear about my suicidality without sending me into a traumatic environment where i cannot leave, then i will never get the treatment i need.

of course im not optimistic. i honestly dont think anyone should be. im not pessimistic either. ive tried all these options with the most open mind imaginable. heck, im still contacting therapists in my area to see what they can do for me. i do my best to give things a fighting chance with whoever i see, but i always arrive back at square one. im not optimistic, im realistic. i can see a pattern and interpret what it means.

i personally thing, in a situation where my mental health seemingly is going to be bad forever because our medical industrial complex is so poorly built, suicide is a reasonable option. if i had never tried to get help, i think it's accurate to say that a suicide would be irrational. but considering that the system seems to not be able to help me, and seeing as mental health problems this severe really do require a mental healthcare professional, i feel as though i am going to be continuing to feel this way for the foreseeable future. and so, given such a fate of being miserable until i die, i think it makes perfect sense for me to make a concerted effort to die.",2662772,,,,,,,,,,,

,2663007,pthnrdnojvsc,"Sep 8, 2024 at 4:05 PM","Most refuse to believe people want to die.

I can't see how any human would want to live.

There are reasons on top of reasons why living is meaningless, dangerous , laborious , burndensome , disgusting , boring , painful , evil .

work so hard all to exist under threat of extreme torture for no reason.

feed yourself 3 times day , all the labor work groceries cleaning to do that . this has been the case for 100's of thousands of years and was even more difficult 100,000 years ago as you had to walk miles to go try to kill animal with a rock and eat it there weren't supermarkets , refrigerators nor deliveries.

I don't see why anyone would want to get up every morning and shower , dress , clean , cook eat , groceries , deal with problems , to do lists, responsibilities , chores , stress, worry, wash clothes, work a job and then get up again the next day non stop . What for ? There is no reason. i hate working, chores, and doing all this labor every day just to exist so something even more horrible will happen to me and then get old and tortured by old age

all this shit sucks. i hate life existence and working. i hate doing anything much more because there isn't any reason to.

i would still prefer non-existence asap even if i were rich or i didn't have to do much . i hate existence and living

1. first layer level of hell. you have to work all day feed yourself 3 times a day , wok a job , chores . you have to get up every single day shower , dress , brush teeth , clean everything, wash everything, fix everything broken, organize everything, . This is the normie level . every normie has to do this every living animal has to constantly feed itself and put up with threats from animals , attackers ,bacteria, fungi, parasites , tape worms, ticks ,mosquities , many of these insects like ticks and mosquitos carry horrible disabling diseases like lyme.
Every day yo u have to work all day for what? for what fucking reason? and this is fun? this is beautiful wonderful sacred important ? wtf? so i'm ""depressed"" im' ""insane"" because i say this ridiculuous level of daily work , problems , suffering there is no reason to do this nor put up with it

There are so many horrible things that can happen to a human any day stroke , cancer , kidnapping torture, tapeworm infection, lyme, accident, oppression , scams risk all this and more for no reason.

i worked in a nursing home. many of these people were very old in pain demented it was unimaginable nightmare. most humans will end up like this.

There is no purpose to life. no one can convince me that there is any reason to live or do do anything. it's all meaningless garbage

Furtheremore everything is proven meaningless by the fact that in 130 years nothing will matter. will anything matter in 10,000 years? no. in a trillion years? no.

.... now skip a few levels as i don't have much time . and go to one of my levels ;

i don't give a fuck if were young , healthy , rich, the things they say are for the best life i would still prefer non-existence asap.

another level of mine. what is a human a 30 trillion monstrous cells, i see no difference between a bug etc., a brain that can suffer undending constant unbearable pain. i was brought here by force. i didn't agree nor want this. life is an evil imposition.

These are some of the things i have said here . there is so much more . imo peole have no idea the hell we are living in.",,,,,,,,,,,,

He says he sell pentobarbital. I sent him an e-mail and here is his answer:

Greetings from the dispensary! We're delighted to have you here. Our inventory includes a range of Nembutal and several other barbiturates available in different forms: capsules, powder, and the most sought-after form, liquid.

Nembutal is a highly potent substance, and it is available in three different forms. The methods of consumption vary for each form: the liquid form can be taken orally or intravenously, the powdered form dissolves in water, and the capsule form is consumed orally.

The process of using Nembutal is quick and painless. Its effects typically begin within six (6) to forty-five (45) minutes after consumption. The substance induces sleep in the brain, leading to the expected outcome once you fall asleep.

Before proceeding, it is important to determine the appropriate quantity based on your body mass index (BMI).

This strengthens the likelihood of a successful outcome by guaranteeing that the necessary amount appropriate for your BMI is consumed. I will provide you with the official dosage if you already know your BMI; if you'd like, you can choose to increase it. It is advised that you have a checkup to get the relevant data if you are unsure of your BMI, or you can just provide your age. When you provide your BMI or age, the dosage and its cost will be disclosed to you. If you have any questions concerning Nembutal or the package you want to order, then let me know.

IS THIS A SCAM?

Thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm still going to ctb but the Olanzapine means I get to live a half decent life in the meantime. I wish the same for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Suicidal or just not living the life I’d like to live,2663046,Clowndollie,"Sep 8, 2024 at 4:33 PM","I've been feeling suicidal for a while now. This first started off because the abusive relationship I was in ended and I just didn't know what to do with myself, i felt like a shell of who I once was. I still do feel that way sometimes but what I'm mainly struggling with is that I just don't know what to do with myself! I don't go to school, I don't have a job, I have almost no friends and the ones I have are very busy with their own lives, no romantic options, no things that fill up my days… And I'm getting so tired of it. Since I was little I have liked to be on stage and I was in love with dancing, only thing is that I sadly decided to quit. I wish I had never did that, I feel like I genuinely could've done something with it if it wasn't for me quitting. It still brings me joy and I consider it one of my hobbies. I wish there was a way for me to get back on the stage, I'd enjoy working in the entertainment industry. I just feel so fucking terrible because of my mental and physical health (mostly my mental health since it affects everything I do) and I feel like it gets in the way of my following my dreams, even though that sounds corny. I feel like I shouldn't complain either because I got into what used to be my dream school for illustration. I just feel so conflicted. I want to do and achieve so many things but I just don't know how to get there. Especially with my mental illnesses ruining it most of the time for me. I just want to be happy for once.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Propranalol and Zopiclone,2662707,bringerofdestrution,"Sep 8, 2024 at 11:41 AM","Hello everyone.

Just looking for a little advice from those with more knowledge than me. I tried ODing on Propranalol, Zopiclone, and Co-Codamol, and it failed because I was found soon enough to receive help - words from the doctors at A&E, although they used the term 'saved' rather than 'failed'. It was my own fault as I scheduled an email which reached my then partner earlier than it should have as I needed to make sure my fur baby was looked after when I was gone.

I'm not entirely sure how many tablets I took as I was in the middle of an episode, but two bottles of propranalol were empty (although I had been taking them regularly before the attempt so it wasn't a full prescription), same with the zopiclone. I'd estimate somewhere around 40 propranalol (1.6g) and 5 zopiclone (37.5mg).

I'm going to attempt again before the end of the month and essentially double the dosage on what I think I took last time, so 80 propranalol and 10 zopiclone. My question is really, should I still include the co-codamol (paracetamol and codeine for those not in the UK) or would the other drugs work better without them? And would it be wise to take anti nausea medication as I'm upping the dose substantially? I didn't feel nauseous last time, but I will be taking a much larger amount and really don't want to fail again.

Thanks so much everyone.

This is my chosen method, and I have researched",,,,,,,,,,,,

"Found the SN, plan is in motion",2662535,schrei_nach_liebe,"Sep 8, 2024 at 9:03 AM","I've already had the AEs on hand for ages both for this method and to use for regular AE purposes.

I stupidly got rid of my SN from probably 5 years or so ago which I would have gotten from a source that probably went by DD, but they only sell to businesses now. Now I have some on the way from the most prominent source I see on here. Had trouble finding it, tried and scrolled for hours several times. Finally found it recently and wanted to bang my head on a wall because it was so obvious, but I'm pretty sure I hadn't scrolled past it before, just wasn't using the right search engines or search terms. I won't respond to a DM about the source, no one did for me either, just have to do your work.

It really sucks that we don't have a right to a peaceful death as per the law, but a right to life is held so tightly whenever it's convenient for those in power, especially when it's a futile life and you can make money off of it. It's an unfortunate vestige of most religions shaping our culture too, in my opinion.
I can say the source is extremely fast and payment went through without a hitch. Tracking says it's on its way in less than 12 hours, and looking by the time of the actual shipping event, it was within a couple hours of the order, it just didn't show up on the carrier for a little while. I really hope this service stays in play because it's the only humane way to deal with someone like me. Almost every single minute of the last 23 years has been from mild to apocalyptic suffering, especially in the several years since my partially successful CTB (leading to an out of hospital cardiac arrest and coma). It just keeps getting worse objectively and subjectively. I get punished most severely when I do the right thing, I get punished when I have nothing left to give, and I get absolutely destroyed when I do the wrong thing. I no longer have the executive functioning to do the right thing. I never had anger issues, but I'm getting more and more furious about my attempt having been aborted. It makes absolutely zero sense how I was able to be brought back to ""life"". I had used my own method chiefly consisting of a tricyclic, carefully calculated along with antiemetics and some other stuff, I'm a licensed professional who deals with a lot of pharmacology and toxicology, I did know exactly what I was doing and I was assured a while after waking up that they had never seen such a lethal overdose, haven't seen that combination, and their minds were blown when I told them precisely what I did and how I took the stuff, they said it was even worse than what they knew, and I didn't vomit. That method literally took less than a minute too long, and I was found after about 40 hours, that's the kind of luck I have. It was even more improbable that I'm here writing this, because I was diagnosed GCS 3 for the first at least couple of days (that's a brain death diagnosis). Obviously I wasn't brain dead, but they didn't know I had anything in my system at that time, as they tested for basically everything I didn't take. If they had known what was in my system (the TCA in particular) they could not have made the brain death diagnosis. I was slated for organ harvesting, but somehow my parents overrode my donor status. So yeah I'm furious, but I also in good conscience cannot blame them, I just wish they could see things from my perspective. I have no regret about CTBing then, but I certainly have regret about my bad luck and the pain it caused everyone else, and it sucks they have to go through the grieving twice.

I kept holding out false hope, I did a lot of legwork trying to make my life better, even went back to school and got another degree. But I only dug myself in deeper. I was letting everyone else gaslight me so much that I ended up gaslighting myself.

I'm going to CTB in very short order after I get my hands on the shipment. The last time I did it, I still had some energy to get most of my loose ends tied up so other people wouldn't have to deal with it. Now my life is such a disaster I wouldn't even know where to begin, and I certainly don't have any incentive to try and clean things up anymore. It's just too far gone at this point, and I feel too much resentment towards the people who I would be cleaning it up for, because they either aggravated my situation or they were involved in me still being ""alive"". I don't want any sort of revenge, it's just that I don't have anything left to give. I feel so much cognitive dissonance just eating, hydrating, and breathing, because it just isn't in my best interest.

If this CTB fails, idk what I'm gonna do. Probably a train or something. I really don't want anyone else involved in my plan, but my freedoms keep getting taken away, and I kind of have the feeling that SN just won't be practically available soon. I'm pretty sure this is my last shot, either because of lack of energy or because I'll have no freedom left.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Suicide by chainsaw,2495557,Jorms_McGander,"May 1, 2024 at 11:46 PM","Yeah I know, you're gonna say that suicide by chainsaw is a ridiculous idea, and it's surely not as popular as some other less violent methods, but for some people it has been the path to mortal release and they have done so for a variety of reasons. So I'd like to just share some of those people. I don't have an academic license to access articles so I am restricted to abstracts, public facing articles, news articles, and whatever I can unlock with the extension available at unpaywall.org. If you see initials it's cuz the full name is in the source. By the way the indentations are my own words and I basically only did that because TIL that ctrl+] indents a whole paragraph.

So without further adieu let's go to Florida:

TM is an inmate in the Florida prison system with schizophrenia and a history of suicide attempts. He landed in the system because he pushed his truck into a lake, so he was arrested for littering over 500lbs. He had avoided his medication for approximately a week by the time of his suicide, and was obviously struggling and not receiving sufficient support within the system. One day on work duty he walked over to a chainsaw on the ground, pulled the cord a few times, stood up and pressed it to his own neck. It is hard to understand all symptoms of schizophrenia, but the anger and isolation at being misunderstood are universal human experiences and no doubt the reaction of his peers to him played a role in his choosing such a violent end.

And now let's take a trip to the academic ether

We will meet a 58 year old caucasian man in a case of what's called a complex suicide. You'll also encounter complex in other contexts like a complex trauma might involve elements of crushing and laceration in the same injury, and a complex suicide in this case involves elements of chainsaw and hanging. So to speak. This man's wife found him ""hanging from the basement ceiling of the cellar in which he lived."" He had moved down there a couple of years prior due to increasing reclusiveness. The article doesn't speak to his relationship with his wife--he was found three hours after death, which suggests that she was engaged in trying to care for him and holds some compassion, but I am speculating and that's as far as I will go. He was taking medication for depression and had previously attempted to OD using those plus alcohol, but it didn't work. There is a path of escalation in behaviour from socially isolating to attempts at nonviolent suicide to his successful suicide. This man's daily routine was to look after his garden in the morning, and then do some wood working in the afternoon. One morning he walked out into his garden, turned his chainsaw on and pressed it against his stomach. He stopped before complete disembowelment. I wonder if he knew that he successfully lacerated his intestines and had nearly disemboweled himself, but he stopped using the chainsaw at that point and went inside and hanged himself from a rafter. The fact that the study doesn't describe the rope as being blood soaked suggests it may have been placed there prior, as the location of other blood [garden, underneath corpse] is noted.

Now we can travel over to academics publishing out of France

A 32 year old Asian woman who was an engineer. I can't get past the abstract for her so I don't know why she was suffering, but I do know she was determined and intelligent and she had a chainsaw. She built a structure out of wood about 1.5M tall with the chainsaw at the top resting on two blocks. There were pulleys, water bottles as counterweights, and elastics secured to the floor. This would control the movement of the chainsaw as it descended once cutting through the blocks upon which it rested. So one day, she lied down facing the floor underneath her homemade chainsaw-guillotine and pressed the power switch she had built for it. The chainsaw cut through its restraints and descended smoothly, cutting through her cervical vertebrae and spinal cord.

Now heading to the UK we'll meet DP

DP was the last man living in a flat determined by his council to be demolished. It is described as ""repossessed"" but it doesn't sound like DP had to do with that because he was the only tenant and had refused eleven offers of alternative living arrangements. This is a case of somebody who needs more support than he was being given--I can't find any information on what was driving him to be so attached to his living space. We can say though, that it wasn't an adaptive position for him to be in. Eventually the council went to court to get an injunction to force him to relocate and allow for whatever progress was slated to occur, and this was the last straw for DP. He tied his chainsaw to the leg of his pool table, rigged up a timer to activate the chainsaw, and laid down underneath it. He placed a piece of cardboard on his neck, the teeth of the saw on the cardboard, and then he turned on the timer and waited. I get the impression that DP did not feel listened to in his situation, his agency may have been eroded and ultimately he responded in one of the only ways he could think of, by inflicting upon himself an incredibly violent death. I can only wonder if there was a way to help him transition without driving him to that.
The UK went through a process of ""dude wtf"" after 9 news agencies reported a whoooole bunch of detail, so I had to use two sources to assemble this story and one is not reliable but it preserves the details after the UK media smartened up and unpublished the deets. Source1 Source2

Now finally we'll take a trip to Serbia

With an academic article I can only access the abstract regarding, a 39 year old man was found dead in a meadow. A chainsaw was lying beside him, and his wounds were restricted to his head, neck and shoulder. He would have been right handed as his left carotid, jugular, and vagus nerve were all completely severed. He managed to cut into C5 and C6 vertebrae and sever his own spinal cord. There were striped lacerations on his left shoulder, so the blade sorta rested there as he did the cut. Finally, this man's job was as a lumberjack so I had to include him because he is the only lumberjack I found in the chainsaw suicides.

Well that's all I got for you. I hope you found this assembly of chainsaw suicides informative. If you get into some of the academic sources you can find a little more related reading, but then you're getting into band saws and circular saws and one 23 year old male who survived giving himself a chainsaw to the neck.

Suicide by chainsaw,2495560,Linda,"May 1, 2024 at 11:56 PM","I work a lot with chainsaws, of several different types, because there are many trees on my farm. I have no doubt that suicide by chainsaw is a possibility. I also have no doubt that it would be risky, and difficult to carry out effectively. There is a real risk that you would survive, but with serious injuries. The basic problem is that a chainsaw is not designed to be held and manipulated in the ways you would need to use it if you wanted to cut your head off. I have just done some simple tests with two of my saws (with the engine off, of course). With the smaller saw, with a 25 cm bar, I could easily get it into position, but such a small saw might not do the job effectively. The larger saw with a 45 cm bar, is much heavier, and I found it almost impossible to position it stably where it could cut my head off.
Bottom line: I would suggest you look for a different method.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I get frustrated with the wave of death that hits you on here, I've noticed.

This is not within my right, to tell people what they should or should not do. I know this. If this was the message received, again I'm sorry, but that was not the intent.

I'm just frustrated with the tide of shite, which I'm trying and desperately failing to hold back and not just in my own mind.

Maybe this: I'm one of those people that needs to find the answer, that needs a reason for something. Like a mathematical model. (Except I'm useless at maths.) Example: This faulty plug socket caused the fire. The bridge fell down because this stanchion failed. The aircraft crashed because this on-board system failed. You get the picture.

I posed this question to myself in the interim: Does everything have to have a reason?

8/30/24

This Wednesday, August 28 2024, I met the team that will be overseeing my treatment. They were very kind and walked me through every step of my journey that I'm about to embark on.

The plan as of now is to have the tumor surgically removed in the next 2 months, then go through rounds of chemo until my cancer enters remission. The good news is, though my tumor has grown through the wall of my colon (as seen on my scans), it doesn't seem to have metastasized yet. They didn't give any % of survival or anything, but they told me it's very likely I will survive this. I still have a young and strong immune system. I've been prescribed some pre-op medications to try to slow the growth of my tumor and control it before it is removed. I went through some other tests, blood, stool, etc... (It was a very long visit to the hospital, to say the least). I did get tested for Lynch syndrome thanks to you guys! (I'm very thankful for all the input you guys have given me <3). I should the test results back in about 5-7 days, so I'll keep you all updated.

As for my emotional and mental state, I've definitely noticed a decline. I moved back in with my parents this week and everyone just seems so down. I understand it. If my son got cancer I wouldn't even know how to feel. They're trying to keep me happy, but it's not really working lol. I've never been ""happy"" and I doubt I ever will. There were days this week when I didn't even get out of bed until 2 pm.

My university knows of my diagnosis, and they are trying their best to cater to my new life. I'm a music education major, which is not an easy degree to earn online. My lesson teacher said she cried when I sent her an email informing her. I really do love my school. I took this week off, except for some of my online assignments. I think I'm gonna try to go for at least 3 days next week, the least I can do is try right? The meds are making me very drowsy though :(

I'm here for any suggestions or comments or anything lol. I love you guys.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Am I the only one??,2662617,M3lancholia,"Sep 8, 2024 at 10:19 AM","I do that too. I think it's because we want to be accepted around people even though we're dying inside. It's easy to put a fake face on - just makes it more difficult for the people around you to understand when you finally succeed in ctb.
On days when it's too hard I tend to avoid people - but benzos help me with the fake smiley face I don't take them often though.
With me I just don't want to look how I feel - & be judged for it",,,,,,,,,,,,
Am I the only one??,2662788,Grumble,"Sep 8, 2024 at 12:57 PM","Putting on an act is extremely common for people suffering from depression.

Why it's getting harder to keep up the persona: It contributes to the ""self-perpetuating cycle"" effect of depression because we only have a very limited amount of energy (if any at all), and it actually takes a lot of energy to put on an act like that. So it adds to our energy drain, worsening our overall condition and using up those precious energy reserves that would be better used to do the things we need to do to try to feel better.

It also reinforces the idea that you have to put on an act just to be accepted by other people -- that people won't accept you for you. So the more you do it, the more you feel you have to do it and the more the energy drain. And then if you didn't have any self-esteem issues at the beginning of this, well, you certainly do now. Then before you know it, you've got full-blown anxiety going on alongside the depression. Or if anxiety was already there, it's certainly worse now. Which then worsens the depression. Which then worsens the anxiety. This is the cyclic effect of mental health problems.

What to do about this? For you, the first thing that comes to mind is a support group. If there are any peer support groups or self-help groups that are local and accessible to you, maybe they could be a way for you to release some of this darkness inside you -- being around people who are dealing with similar issues and opening up about it.

Putting up this act all the time, it's like keeping a cork on a volcano. You really want to release some of that pressure if at all possible.",2662608,,,,,,,,,,,

I understand that maybe it wouldn't be worth risking, but the thing is that I am in this moment already suffering, and whether it's a void or something else I will end up there eventually.

In the relative space of the universe, it doesn't matter whether I die now or later because in the end it's the same result and the amount of time I felt I experienced would be the same (no time at all) if it's a void. A void means no suffering, but if there is an afterlife or reincarnation, going by NDEs, it also means there is no suffering...until the next life, of course.

With regards to reincarnation, I just don't know but I feel like, if any part of us is recycled, it's not the bit we understand to be 'us'. Our memories, our personal sense of self. If we reincarnate here and have been for however many billions of years then, I feel like it's a factory reset each time as it were.

I'd like to say we'll find out but we won't, because we certainly don't know that right now either. (Assuming we have reincarnated)
In that sense, simply ceasing to exist and for there to be ""nothing"" seems the the obvious and logical answer.

That said, i'd love for there to be more after death though, something like an afterlife or anything could be the ""truth"" that only makes sense once you experience it, perhaps only during an intermediary phase between death and the subsequence of it.

At the same time concept of afterlife and heaven as such are terrifying as either people lose a sense of self or it cannot be any different than earth, because how can you have a sense of self and not have any conflict or pain? And an eternal life on something like earth is uhhh something?
The only way that would work is if we each get something like our own realm but then it feels like I'm talking about magic and unicorns or simply living in a dream as who you interact with wouldn't be real but your own creations to satisfy yourself.",2645347,,,,,,,,,,,

you also mentioned pills. while this is certainly easier to do from a survival instinct perspective, this is also incredibly unlikely to work. most pills these days are generally quite safe even in extreme doses.

i'd recommend avoiding both of these to spare yourself any headaches or hard feelings from failing. you've been on this site for a while it seems, but have you checked out the suicide resource compilation? you may find something better there. and remember, if you ever have any questions, hesitations, or ideas about any method, it's important to ask questions like you're doing now rather than go in blind on assumptions. people here are quite knowledgeable, and with something as important and consequential as CTB, it's imperative that you don't do it impulsively on little information.

It's tough. There definitely are better and worse jobs, but at the end of the day it is still going to take most of your life. I am the ""normie king"" on here because I reject black and white absolutism about work and blackpill stuff but I absolutely understand the prospect of working your life away causing dread.

I don't have magic answers, but there are two things you can think about: making work suck less and making the time outside work better to compensate.

To make work suck less, you can:
Find jobs that are lower stress
find jobs that take less of your time (fewer hours/part time/remote)
find jobs with less commute
work with better people
take care of yourself so you have more energy
take care of your mind. I know ""mindset"" advice is annoying but it does help.
To make life outside of work better. . . that's really up to you. For me financial independence, love and marriage, and the ability to live in the area I want and pursue the hobbies I want to the extent I want has all helped give me some motivation.

,2757,Neo-Schopenhauerian,"May 6, 2018 at 12:19 PM","Alice, if you really want to give life a chance, try racemic ketamine. I really recommend prioritizing this, because the effects of CBD likely won't even be close. I'll include something about anxiolytics at the bottom. I experimented with it years ago (possibly 7) when news was first coming out, about its potential. It definitely works. I used the s-isomer because it has less side effects and duration, but it turns out racemic may be considerably more effective.

Personally, I didn't find it enjoyable at all, but it wasn't that bad. The doses used for depression aren't that high. You just feel dissociated, disconnected from your body, and when you move there's a feeling like there's a lag between your decision to move and the actual movement, which some describe like you're controlling a marionette. It also doesn't tend to trigger anxiety and wasn't very psychedelic at that level. I didn't find it enjoyable at all, so there's zero risk of addiction for me. I've also extensively researched it, and there are no serious concerns about health effects at the doses and frequencies used.

Basically you just lay down for an hour or two and then depression is significantly and rapidly alleviated for a week or two, you have less anhedonia, more motivation.

I don't know if you know anyone who can get some IRL, but although the darknet markets may be intimidating if you're never used them before, it's actually a very easy and safe process. Even if they get caught, which is very unlikely, especially if shipped domestically, particularly if you're in a country with better drug laws, all that happens is that you eventually get a letter stating they've seized it and that's it. Law enforcement does not care about such a small amount of ketamine, there's so much going on that has far higher priority.

I've rented a mailbox at a post office for only $8 a month. Here in the US you can get packages held even if you rent the smallest size, and get things delivered from companies like UPS, FedEx, and DHL if you use street address formatting. Some locations have other perks, like sending you scans of mail you're about to receive or even emailing/texting you when you have a package to pick up.

I'll probably receive some ketamine Monday, and hopefully it will at least ease my suffering and allow me to wrap things up before I go.

I have severe treatment resistant chronic depression and there are really no options left available to me, having even failed Nardil. This is nothing like the typical medication they give you.

I also have chronic anxiety due a neurological disorder. By not responding to pharmaceuticals, do you mean you've tried benzos and they haven't worked? If you don't want to support pharma, you can get unscheduled anxiolytics like etizolam online, which greatly augment exposure therapy. A lot of people also seem to respond well to kava extract.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2662753,schrei_nach_liebe,"Sep 8, 2024 at 12:33 PM","I did 22.5g of amitriptyline, I'm about 130kg. I took about 2g of quetiapine, 1g lorazepam, a large amount of meto, and I can't remember exactly what else, but it was something I put together myself, along with a moderate amount of alcohol. From what I could gather based on when I stopped responding to texts and calls, it took a couple hours to lose consciousness. I lived alone, but I was found about 40 hours after I ingested the cocktail because people noticed I dropped off abruptly and started contacting each other, they weren't really expecting what had happened though. Literally seconds after I was found I went into cardiac arrest, several minutes before paramedics arrived. They spent close to an hour resuscitating me, I don't know exactly how much was on the ground vs in transit but it was documented simply that I had been in a state of anoxia for approximately 13 minutes. I was intubated on my driveway. My mistake was that I didn't crush the amitriptyline and it took too long, but I was successful in preventing emesis. It wasn't even suspected initially that I had ingested anything because there wasn't anything at the scene that indicated I downed a truckload of pills, and they had administered naloxone several times to no effect, because there was no opioid. It was coincidental that I had literally the worst case of bilateral pneumonia you could possibly have and they were convinced that was the culprit, until my scheduled note arrived a few days later explaining specifically what I did. The likely reason I ended up not dying from the amitriptyline was that I was placed on ECMO and CRRT which would have filtered out my blood to some degree. I was in acute renal and hepatic failure, but my kidneys somehow came back, which is one of the many things that they didn't think I would recover from. Because they didn't know I had ingested anything initially, they deemed me to be brain dead (I did not respond to any brainstem reflex tests at all for at least a couple days). But, especially with amitriptyline, a diagnosis of brain death cannot be made (assuming they know it's there). This wasn't at some podunk hospital either, this was a large and well-respected university hospital in one of the biggest cities in the states. The recovery was pretty rough, I had nerve damage which left me unable to use the left side of my body for several months which was mostly caused by pressure on my left side from laying motionless those 40 hours, along with the anoxic brain injury probably causing some other movement and balance issues. I mostly adapted, but I still have areas where I can't seem to exert the strength and dexterity I should have, and areas of my limbs I can't feel. Getting off the ventilator was extremely difficult, I went through many many breathing trials and failed, it was like I forgot how to breathe. Intellectually, it never seemed like I lost any memory, and I very clearly remember researching, writing the note, taking the meds, laying down on my couch, and continuing to engage in group chats with my friends as I normally would until I simply went unconscious. There was nothing at all between falling unconscious until I opened my eyes in the ICU and saw the date on the whiteboard and was like ""uh oh"". It took an excruciatingly long time to indicate to someone that I wasn't a vegetable, the only thing I could do was try to make eye contact but I really couldn't figure out how to make any part of my body move. It was definitely like when someone describes locked-in syndrome.

Sorry I was so long-winded, but I would say it's a plausible method, but it takes a long time and the longer a method takes, the more likely people are going to notice. I was seconds away from success.",,,,,,,,,,,,

i can assure you you're experiencing anxiety-based symptoms, and untreated anxiety can lead to a depressive state.

my intrusive thoughts got better after a month taking my anxiety meds again (i had stopped). they consisted of fear of killing someone and running away while driving, fear of doing a terrible, terrible thing to my pets, to pets i treat at the veterinary hospital i worked, fear of committing zoophilia, pedophilia, theft, agression. disturbing images popped into my head, related to traumas, things i've never done etc etc.

keep this in mind: for any diagnosis to be valid, you don't need to just attend the diagnostic criteria. there is a severity and impairment criteria related. i would suggest, if you're capable, to search a psychiatrist. they can help identify anxiety related issues and medicate you to prevent crisis and treat your symptoms.

Lions your odds are not great. You must have seen how domestic cats something ""play"" with their ""food"" (mice, rats, etc). Eventually they get bored of it and go off and do something else. Lions and lionesses will only go for you if they are hungry and need to feed. Most of the time they are bored and just find things to amuse themselves.

Ok. Now Hippos. Very very high chance. The animal that kills the most people in Africa isn't lions, crocodiles, venomous creatures…. It's hippos. They don't mess around and will obliterate you even if you aren't food. Watch a video of how little pressure it takes them to crush a watermelon.

,2662600,schrei_nach_liebe,"Sep 8, 2024 at 10:01 AM","Cars aren't sealed at all, they have vents usually hidden behind the plastic panels in the trunk that are kind of one-way only, the little doors in the vents blow open when you shut your car door to release the pressure and prevent your eardrums from blowing. Even though they're one-way-ish, there's not much of a seal, on top of that, the HVAC system isn't really sealed. The thing most people don't realize is that even though you wouldn't be increasing the pressure all that much by releasing a gas, you've still got craploads of oxygen inside to flow out. However, the partial pressure of oxygen will likely be a whole lot more than the pressure differential increase you would be trying to replace the air inside the car with, meaning oxygen is going to keep flowing back in by osmosis (high to low concentration) to equalize the concentration with the air outside the car. That force of osmosis is probably just going to win every time, even though it's only about 1/5th of the total pressure of the ambient air (14.7psi at sea level, so depending on concentration difference up to 1/5 of that 14.7 is going to be trying to diffuse back into the car and there isn't a whole lot you can do to stop it).

**Edit**
I should add that it probably could work if you had a really high flow of inert gas, or if you had some sort of apparatus like the bag with a small volume inside flowing out at a high rate so that the oxygen doesn't have time to flow back in. I just don't think that it would be feasible to have enough flow/volume/reserve of helium unless you had like a large welding bottle because the volume of the car is huge compared to something you could wear. I would be afraid of running out of the inert gas too early. Even just a little bit of oxygen is too much, makes a huge risk of failure and potentially permanent injury.",,,,,,,,,,,,

as a gen Zer i can clearly see that most of my generation is experiencing symptoms of mental illnesses that were once attributed to a minority of the population. although suicide is still deemed illogical to most, it seems like many of the youth is struggling with perceiving a personal future or believing they are capable enough to function in society. the unemployment rate and mental health statistics should serve as proof of such.

i am not one to believe that social media is the cause of it all. upon studying my despair i come across concepts such as the constant unwavering acknowledgement of the agony of the modern human condition, hopelessness for humanity's ability to eliminate greed and prioritize social betterment, and an inability to find a support system outside of professional help.

i believe that the rising suicide rate of my generation can be mostly attributed to a newfound desire to escape the rat race clashing with the immense social pressure to settle into a ""cog-in-machine"" lifestyle. if you were to attribute the rise of suicide to one modern factor what would it be? do you agree that the digitalization of daily living is a fierce motivator, or perhaps increased access to non-painful methods of CTB? i'd like to hear your thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If I were to blame one thing, I suppose it would be financial inequality. It's that that forces us into wage slavery and doing jobs we have no interest in. That said, perhaps that isn't entirely true either. Some younger members here clearly don't really have financial worries as their parents are supporting them- begrudgingly or not.

One difference I've definitely noticed between me and my Dad and Grandparents. I'm Generation X, he's a Baby Boomer- is that I've largely rejected the sense of responsibility he clearly feels. Towards lots of things. I work but begrudgingly but I don't have the same sense of pride or obligation to keep the home and garden tidy. I don't really keep myself all that tidy! I think older generations felt more obliged to conform to things- including staying alive! They maybe felt more responsibility towards others to keep going and obey the rules. I guess it's maybe the rise of individualism that has encouraged us to question what we want and question social norms and authority. I suppose it's that willingness to challenge and break the rules combined with the audacity I suppose to even look at the world and think/ say- it's all so unfair, it sucks and I want no part of it. I suspect there are places in the world still where people aren't allowed to question. I wonder if their suicide rates are higher or lower. If they are higher, is it because they're aware that there are more liberal ways of living out there and, they feel trapped?

But, I feel like it's simply that life is hard. People are struggling financially, socially. Our healthcare systems are crumbling (in the UK at least.) People feel less obliged to put up with it when they are encouraged to think freely- maybe selfishly and, decide for themselves.",,,,,,,,,,,,

- we don't read books (???)
- social media ofc

idk as someone who has chronic suicidality and can clearly state that it boils down to the simple fact that there is no space for mental illness in my country i find it baffling that no one speaks on the pressures of capitalism and how ableist society is naturally.

i really can't fathom people killing themselves and stating loneliness, stress, hopelessness etc as their reasoning without delving deeper into where those feelings come from. the answer is almost always some faction of capitalism.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2654202,AAE,"Sep 1, 2024 at 4:29 PM","Because society, mass media, politics, health care, everything is steering the world into a direction where many end up completely logically hopeless based on our most natural needs that are being denied, always claiming we're ""asking for too much"" be it having an own, safe place to live, proper health care or needing someone who loves us. Ask yourself why there are pet shelters where people adopt animals in need but no human shelters where people adopt humans in need, just one example.

The only logic reason for why they keep doing this (except to those who are filthy rich and they can use for that reason) is to reduce population ""passively"" without any visible blood on their hands for the brainwashed majority. The poorest part of population, mostly, since it's truly all about money, all those in power care about.

Europe is one big war zone where they keep letting millions from far-away violent cultures immigrate even though it's been stated in some studies that as much as 96% might only come here not for refuge but ""to get a better life"" because propaganda is being spread in their home countries saying everything is free here, and to most of them, it is. Hate crime and racism against the ethnic populations is at its peak yet mass media and politicians keep denying it to the fullest and prosecuting anyone for speaking up about the injustice and suffering since they've changed laws originally created to protect the jews after WW2 to include everyone except the ethnic population. I, as a poor person am forced to live in the same area where I grew up, seeing it turn from an affordable safe haven to a chaotic hell full of the loudest, most violent people I've ever come across, the stress of it all made my mother and I (who are/were both chronically ill) age prematurely and she died… The safer areas always cost way too much because they know that those who can will pay to be able to be safe. Getting a loan to buy an own, safe home is something the poorest can't do and nobody cares. Mass media says it's not true = the majority nods. ""Sweden has never been safer"" is a common quote from politicians. ""Racism against the ethnic population doesn't exist"" is another.

Here in Sweden, cutting off our roots and ruining what had almost become a true safe haven of a country is how they get rid of us who are sick and poor. They know just as well as we do that we end up with no hope or die from the stress like my dear mom if we don't get killed for simply being ethnic swedes.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2656302,uglyugly,"Sep 3, 2024 at 8:58 AM","I think there are several reasons, but all are only my opinion. I'm old, so I'm essentially talking about the late 60s to the 80s here.

When I was growing up, the family was still a strong unit. There were two parents who were generally very involved in their kid's lives and who cared about each other. My dad worked and my mom stayed home until I was 10. Married couples usually worked hard to sort out differences instead of breaking up the family through divorce. Now it's common. A lot of families are broken... sometimes multiple times in a child's upbringing. There is no family foundation any more and ""family"" has almost become a dirty word. When a child grows up in an unstable environment, I think they have a greater risk of depression. Most mothers have to work outside the home in order to help provide for ever-rising costs, which means dumping a kid in daycare. No matter how good the care is, it's not the same as a parent's love. (I am not criticizing anyone working, but instead am pointing out a major change from my childhood to now.)

Inflation has driven so many into poverty, but, part of those costs are related to having the greatest and the latest... we did not do that when I was young. The priority was more focused on having strong ties with the family, friends, and the community. And we simply wanted less. The times I remember with my mom were things like us cooking together and me helping her at school, not what we bought or owned. Now I can't survive financially. A person in poverty who can barely afford survival leads to depression - I can relate to this.

Tech has changed everything. We went skating, were outside, played sports, rode bikes, built forts and got horribly dirty without being afraid of germs and other nonsense. Computers only started to come into being in the mid to late 80s. I can't tell you how grateful I am that I grew up without a smart phone, computer, or social(ist) media. With everyone looking at a screen or social media 24/7, it's much harder to be connected with other people, it keeps people inside, sedentary, and isolated. The media has convinced us that the sun is evil (getting sunlight raises vitamin D levels, a lack can contribute to depression) and that dangerous germs are going to kill us all any minute. Speaking of the media, it is nothing at all like it was: now it is all fear mongering. They used to actually TELL you the news, now it's all hype. Living in constant fear raises depression.

I believe the food and intake of chemicals can lead to depression. Almost all prepared food has so much chemical crap in it. I was severely depressed in high school for many reasons, but it was not until I was an adult that I understood that what I ate most definitely affected my mood, and that was before all food was garbage. When I eliminated most sugar, alcohol (which is sugar), chemically laden junk food and boxed crap, it lifted 70% of my depression. But if all a person is eating is garbage (some of us have no choice) and are slathering chemicals all over our bodies every day (the skin absorbs things) plus breathing polluted air can IMO contribute heavily to mood.

The last 4 years of virus panic nonsense have driven many into fear, anxiety, and depression either over the illness or the reaction to it. I think that whole time people were conditioned to be afraid, regardless of which side of the debate you may be on. For a kid, living in constant fear is very destructive. The inflation and destruction of small businesses, some of which have never recovered or reopened, plus the loss of life savings, homes, careers, a way of life and other family members is devastating. I had a nervous breakdown in 2020 when my entire family jumped on the media bandwagon and I refused to. Those relationships have never been repaired and now a lot of those people are dead. Many now think that we have reached a tipping point in the economy and nothing will ever be affordable again. Why keep going on when one can't afford such simple things as decent food, a home, and some security?

Any one of the things mentioned above may not cause someone to be so depressed that they decide to ctb, but when you get a lot of them going at once, it's easy to see where the despair comes from.",,,,,,,,,,,,

im genderless, living in a violently transphobic country, stuck under financial control by my neglectful family (cant work right now bcos Disabled) and am riddled with health problems. none of these things seem to be getting better and ive been wanting to CTB since i was a tween.

Then, I hated highschool. I didn't make any friends and I couldn't afford any hobbies, so all I could do was doomscroll. But I told myself I'd have more freedom in university, and it will be worth tolerating.

Then, I hated university. The workload was unbearable and I was too anxious to do anything enjoyable. I told myself I'd have more time once I got a job, where I could leave all my work obligations at the end of my work day and have free time to do anything I wanted, and I'd have the money to support my hobbies while savings towards my goals.

I'm new here, and I only discovered this forum three days ago (Sorry if my English isn't perfect).
I'm currently in my early 30s, and I'm having a hard time understanding how my survival instinct has kept me here for so long, simply amazing. I knew from the age of 10 that I wasn't exactly wired like most of the people around me, and it didn't take me a long time to guess that I would probably have to leave this cursed carousel before its last turn. Well, the time seems to have come, and it sure has taken its time, but despite a life of which it would be unfair to complain about, because there's objectively worse, even though it hasn't been easy (to say the least), I think that maybe I shouldn't have act for my entire life by constantly played the role of the perfectly normal and mentally strong guy to my loved ones, or even everybody else, and instead get myself hospitalized at a time when it could still have made a difference. Instead of that, I still struggle with the same ghosts that petrified me as a child, while all my acquaintances from that time have naturally made an admirable journey through life, just killing it; and I'm not even talking about professionally or with relationships (once again, I can't complain), I'm talking about remaining locked up in his own head, instead of just evolving. Like an ape trying to understand and imitate human behavior at the zoo. (I'm sure some of you can relate)

But enough of the tearful speech; my game plan is to ctb before the end of the year. I've considered some options, thanks to several threads found here:
- SN (Looks comfortable, but it seems very difficult to get hold of it, other than through professional ways, unfortunately. But I'm all ears...).
- Hanging (Seems quite feasible, only problem being that I have to do it outdoors. The mere idea of my wife finding me in this state takes away all the desire to kill myself).
- CO in my car, in the middle of nowhere of course, to avoid collateral damage (This was my first option, but after some research, it seems rather technical, and surprisingly easy to screw up).
Oh, and I'm afraid of heights, so don't even talk to me about jumping from anywhere higher than 2m haha. I might die before I even get close to the edge (maybe that's the way then )
So, yeah, I wouldn't mind some sound advice, if you have any. Thanks in advance.

And that's it ! I hope that all those here who can still hope to get out through the ways of healing, and maybe full recovery, will do so without too much trouble, I really do;
and for the others, such as myself, I wish them to finally find what they have been looking for their whole life, a little peace, at last.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2661837,scubadam,"Sep 7, 2024 at 5:07 PM","tl;dr: i never cut myself as a form of punishment or getting my emotions out, i even actually like it, and im trying to figure out why

first time i cut myself i was something around 16.5 and i did it just to see what was the whole hassle about. it felt weird, but i didn't feel bad for it later and quickly forgot about it

at 17 i went for a trip to a foreign country to try out something i've never done before with people whom i have never met before. for some reason i took one razor blade with me (i seriously can't remember why, maybe it was for cleaning up my eyebrow slot) and held it in my wallet. on the last day i unintentionally hurt an animal, but i felt that as a punishment i should hurt myself too, so i could kind of ""feel it's pain on me"". those three cuts were the deepest i've ever went, i felt my forearm go numb (i thought i messed up my nerves but i was just panicking) and i promised myself to never to do that again. of course it did not work

when i came back to school, after a week or so i started cutting every second day or so. they were never deep or big or anything, i didn't think of them as a form of punishment or getting emotions onto me; i actually enjoyed it. i didn't like the pain itself, but seeing blood on my hand and the wound afterwards was always something nice. my best friend would cut too, but he would go extremely deep for a first timer. i am the only person that he has ever told about it. the only time i felt bad about it was when i sat next to my dad in a train and my left arm was on his side, so i didn't really have a way to hide it. i didn't want him to worry about me, i'm sure he saw them but, he has never said a single word about it

fast forward, exactly 11 months and 2 weeks have passed since the last time i did it. i initially started counting the days to prove that i was not addicted in any way and i wouldn't get the urges, and it did work, but after around 10 months when the summer break came and later the school year, i started thinking of relapsing once again. it wasn't caused by anything bad, in fact i had the best time i had in years during that period of time. i feel bad for the fact that i started the count on my phone because breaking such a long time would be dumb; if i didn't stay clean for so long, i wouldn't feel bad about breaking it. i've grown to trust one of the people who was on that trip i mentioned earlier, and told them about me cutting. they actually destroyed and threw away a razor blade i had in my wallet when i asked them to, as i couldn't do that myself (or maybe i wanted attention? that's something i sometimes think that i subconsciously wanted that), and every now and then they ask me about how long i've been clean for. that way, i unfortunately made staying clean a promise not only to myself

and here's the title question: why do i cut? maybe somebody from aside would be able to give me the answer, or if not, they maybe can lead me into a way of finding it",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2661874,LapseInTime,"Sep 7, 2024 at 6:05 PM","I used to do it when I was a teen - always not too deep, usually with items that weren't razors, always in private. Looking back, I find that I, 90% of the time, did it when I was sad. It is true that sometimes I did not because I was in the depths of my depression, but mostly because something was overwhelming; good or bad. Though, it does surprise me that somebody considers cutting when they are -or should be, it is not perceived the same when somebody is depressed- ""happy"". I remember that it was something that calmed me down and distracted me. Perhaps, when somebody's prone to getting over-stimulated in any way, cutting provides some sort of relief in numbing any intense emotions?

I agree that you can cut yourself without wanting to ""punish"" yourself. Whether with cutting or an ED, I find that the verb ""to punish"" can be overused, perhaps in a corny way sometimes? I feel that it is a very hasty judgement - somebody sees you, they know you feel guilty, sad and depressed, they assume that this can only be perceived as being detrimental and that there must be a reason (one they can understand) behind it so there you go; ""they're punishing themselves!"". A psychiatrist of mine once said that everything ""harmful"" helps you get endorphins, which make you calm down, feel more present and content. I find this explanation to work for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2661922,EvisceratedJester,"Sep 7, 2024 at 6:58 PM","First off, these two statements kind of contradict each other.

Secondly, how deep did you cut? (dermis/Styro? Hypodermis/fat/bean? Fascia?) Just curious, you do not have to answer.

Thirdly, there are people who started cutting out of curiosity and ended up becoming addicted to it. When you self-harm your body releases endorphins to help with the pain and to relieve stress and sometimes people become addicted to these endorphins. While you may not be addicted to the endorphins, maybe you still like them and thus you cut because of that. Think of it like drinking every once in a while. You may not be an alcoholic but that doesn't mean that you don't like the way alcohol makes you feel and thus indulge in it every once in a while. people also cut as a form of self-control, rather than as a emotional coping mechanism or as a form of self punishment. So, you might be cutting for one or both of those reasons instead.",2661837,2661837,,,,,,,,,,
,2661948,scubadam,"Sep 7, 2024 at 7:32 PM","oh yeah, I forgot to mention this was the only time I used it as a punishment or because I was feeling down or anything

,2662501,Virsus,"Sep 8, 2024 at 8:25 AM","I agree with the answers above, self-harm should release endorphins - it calms. You wrote that when you returned to school, you started cutting yourself - self-harm calms.
I also have a thought that this is how you wanted to attract attention, but I say this not in a derogatory sense, but in a practical sense - Perhaps this is how you wanted to tell others that you need help.
I subconsciously do something similar, only periodically I take blood from a vein, the sight of blood calms me, and before I burned my hands with extinguished hot matches, perhaps I wanted to express myself that way too.

,2662542,M3lancholia,"Sep 8, 2024 at 9:08 AM","I was sectioned for 28 days in June and finally discharged after 5 weeks of hospitalisation in the UK. I was starting to feel a bit of hope but all has crashed down around me now, 5 weeks after being discharged. I feel like I'm being punished for not wanting to be here and all the suicidal feelings are coming back. Life is so hard and I've lost the people who mean the most to me. I'm being judged by everyone and it's not positive. Only the professionals helping me now are telling me how good it is that I've come so far etc.
I had SN ready previously but that has now been taken from me.
I don't have the energy to fight anymore - everything keeps stacking against me & tomorrow I'll find out if I can go back to work. It'll be the final nail in the coffin if they say no as I love my job and obviously need it for financial reasons.
I don't feel 'crazy' or mentally ill - I just can't do life anymore. When I was in hospital I felt like they wanted to label me with some mental health disorder but couldn't. I rationally want to leave this life.
I'm in the middle of court proceedings (family law) that are making everything worse as I'm being judged by people who don't even know me.
I feel guilty for wanting to give up but really everyone would be better without me. I'm not an alcoholic/don't do drugs/never abused my children, yet apparently I'm too much of a risk to my children because of how I felt in June. Seeking help has made everything 1000 times worse and any hope has just been replaced with despair.
Has anyone else found that coming out of hospital after being sectioned has made everything worse?

I live in Russia and I have the opportunity to get to Yakutia by train in 5 days; in winter the temperature there can drop to -30/-45.
For two days before arriving, I plan to eat nothing but water. Also don't sleep for two days.
The energy should be as low as possible, but still enough to go into the forest.
On the train, before disembarking, I will train my muscles so that they do not have the energy to warm the body, except for the legs, they must have enough strength to walk through the snow in the forest.
Then leave at the siding at about 6 o'clock in the morning, dawn comes at about 8-9 o'clock.
Then I will try to go as far into the forest as possible, ideally 7-8 km, maybe more.
When I start to feel like I'm freezing, I'll gradually drink a bottle of alcohol, and eventually, finally tired, I'll sit by a tree and try to fall asleep.

Question:
What is the likelihood that I will be discovered before my death?
Can the police track me by phone if I turn it off 6 hours before landing? I'm not going to tell anyone that I left, my relatives will probably file a search.
How soon can I be discovered after death?
What should I do with footprints left in the snow?

I live in Germany and have to use Google Translate.

First of all, thank you for having this community.


I read a report of a live-streamed CTB:

22:45 SN
22:49 Started one last cigarette
22:50 Nausea sets in
22:50 Dizziness sets in
22:51 puked a little in a plastic bag
22:52 fell over, no longer responds to sounds
22:53 tries to say something, body twitches
22:54 unconscious, shallow breathing
22:55 more cramps, breathing becomes more difficult
22:58 is barely breathing now
23:02 Does it seem like he's breathing more evenly now?
23:04 he's somehow still breathing
23:07 is still breathing, albeit slowly. not conscious
23:10 no more breathing (I'm not 100% sure)
23:18 no movement at all, we think he's resting now

The mention of cramps and twitching scares me.
Likewise, breathing for a long time.
I'm afraid of consciously feeling the suffocation.
But SN is my method now that I'm hanging
I canceled twice and didn't see any other option.

Can someone help me relieve my fear of suffocation?

I thank you",,,,,,,,,,,,

Well, you should use Benzos to calm down (that's suggested in the protocol). However, you probably won't pass out bc the Benzos are knocking you out rather it's the effects of SN. You'll be short of breath, probably feel tachycardia. People who were rescued said despite those effect the process was peaceful.

You won't feel suffocation in terms of CO2 increase or strangling.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ive tried to get support and help my my mental health for well over a decade and almost every doctor, mental health worker, psychiatrist i came across was a heartless b**ch/b**tard who didn't give a toss and made my situation worse. The NHS IS NOT underfunded, its a never ending money pit, its not fit for purpose and alot of the people who work in it (not all) are people who just dont give a toss.
People are being forced into situations where they have no other option other than to end their lives in horrific, traumatic and undignified ways because 1) Peaceful euthenasea is not legalised to those who want it which is a fucking crime on humanity.
2) Human society is fucked and most people just dont care because people are a shitty species.
Throw as much money as you want into the system thinking more money will fix a shitty system and shitty people it wont.

I could post about my life with it and that of my cousin, local stories I've heard and the people on this forum but at this point I'd be beating a dead horse.

I agree with you on the money part, money is just numbers, the rot runs much deeper. I think to some degree it always has. Regardless of the Government's cutbacks here in the past 10 years, the NHS in my memory has always been a nightmare to work with if you have a serious condition. Granted, it is much worse now.

It's just fundamentally broken. And honestly, from what I've seen in the past few years, even the staff themselves don't truly care anymore. If they could earn a pence more working private, they probably would!",,,,,,,,,,,,

It doesn't matter if it's the NHS or expensive private top doctors, the very science of psychology and neurology is flawed, understudied and barely understood. That is why mental illness is nearly impossible to treat. The NHS and doctors in general are awesome in treating a broken leg, but healing a broken heart... nope.

Furthermore it's the culture: doctors and everyone else are excited about saving lives from immediate death (cancers, accidents, dangerous infections) but what happens to the patient's life quality AFTER he is ""saved"" they don't care about. As long as they can brag about saving lives like superheroes.

Once the patient complains of permanent side effects from the treatments, suddenly the doctors have nothing they can do, they are even too cowardly to prescribe addictive pills to relieve symptoms and just closely monitoring the dose. The irony is that nobody really ""saves"" a life; they just pospone death a few years or decades.",,,,,,,,,,,,

You are now subjecting an innocent person to be involved in the act of your death. This person did not consent. They did not ask to be put in this situation. And while people argue that ""they knew the risk when they decided to be a train conductor, they can handle it"", any train conductor will tell you that is absolutely not true. They went into train conducting to drive trains, not assist suicides. And they will be the first to tell you it is the most traumatic experience of their life that many never get over. It has driven people to end their careers, given them PTSD, etc. Just because it CAN happen on the job doesn't mean it makes it okay or any easier for them.

i hate myself so much. seriously why was i even born? my mother told me before that she tried to abort me but it didnt worked, and i fucking wish she tried harder to get rid of me so i dont have to live this hell. i genuinely cant keep going anymore omg. i had planned to attempt suicide yesterday but i was too tired so i ended up falling asleep instead and i was surprised that i was still alive after waking up and i hate myself more for that. why do i have to keep living like this? like why? being alive is literally pure torture if i have to live with this mind for the rest of my life. im so tired. i think my exhaustion is beyond words right now. i have been trying to kill myself for the past year and i just cant fucking do it and each day my self hatred and despair deepens. everyday i wish i hadnt been born so i dont have to deal with all of this. if only my mother tried harder while she was trying to get rid of me....i wouldnt be here writing this. everyday i wish i would die in my sleep so i dont have to go through the complicated process of killing myself. i didnt even gave permission for the universe to bring me into this world, so why do i have to keep going even if i dont want to anymore? fuckkkk my lifeeeeeeeee. everytime i look at my body all i see are cuts and scars that will stick with me for the rest of my life and i hate how fat i am even though i have lost a lot of weight even though i have already risked my health just to lose weight even if i knew i didnt had to. i still see myself as overweight even though im underweight. i know my head is just playing tricks with me but why does it sound and look so real? i swear everytime i look at the mirror i genuinely cant see a underweight person. right now i actually gained weight because im struggling to control my food intake and im just so scared to step on the scale at this point. i need to escape my head before things get even worse from here. i need to escape my mind. i need to escape my mind. why do i have to live in this mental anguish....? im truly done with life",,,,,,,,,,,,

Ethics and Optics of Livestreaming CTB?,2662300,banger12,"Sep 8, 2024 at 3:15 AM","As someone who has and is still currently debating livestreaming my CTB (for various reasons), I was wondering about what others thoughts are on the subject.

The question of the ""ethics"" of livestreaming it is very straightforward in what I mean by it. Is livestreaming CTB morally right?

By ""optics"" I'm referring to whether the action is helpful or harmful to the pro-choice ideal on CTB and support for such? Are there also exceptional cases in regards to either answer of the optical question?

Note too that this question/discussion prompt has nothing to do with the logistics of this.

Curious what people here think.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Ethics and Optics of Livestreaming CTB?,2662312,Praestat_Mori,"Sep 8, 2024 at 3:29 AM","CTB is your personal decision - whether to stream it (with the risk of ending up on gore sites) is also your personal decision. Whether people will watch the stream or not is their decision, people generally also watch public executions (in countries where they're still performed in public).

The question: How fast will the streaming platform interfere? Is it possible for pro-lifers to interfere? I'd be worried about that more than about the question of what is morally right or wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Ethics and Optics of Livestreaming CTB?,2662313,Forever Sleep,"Sep 8, 2024 at 3:30 AM","Not sure how it could be morally wrong. You're choosing to livestream it. Other people are choosing to watch. The only time it would feel morally wrong would be if someone filmed it without your permission. If someone used the material for dodgy purposes- some weird gore fetish- that you hadn't agreed to.

Or- if you were coercing people into watching it. They didn't really want to watch it but you tried to emotionally manipulate them- 'I don't want to be alone. It would mean a lot if you could be there for me' etc. Because potentially, I suppose it could traumatize someone which, wouldn't be right if they hadn't chosen to witness it.

Or, you reveal who you are and where you are- which then puts the viewers in a moral quandry as to whether they should alert authorities. Bearing in mind, I imagine they could get into trouble if they don't.

As for supporting pro-choice. What is the concern there? That it is distressing to see? That it could put people off? Maybe it's best that we acknowledge what it is we're considering doing. I hope it isn't unpleasant for any of us but- if it is, maybe that also demonstrates why assisted suicide should be legalised. We shouldn't be having to subject ourselves to all this risk with DIY methods.

Ultimately though, I think it all hinges on consent. If you've consented to be filmed. If the material is appropriately labelled with warnings if it's distressing. If the people witnessing it therefore know what they're witnessing- then, it's all consensual to my mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,

You do raise fair points though. Thank you.
Your response is great and very well thought out. Thank you so much I appreciate it.

I wouldn't ever do any of the ethically wrong things you described as off limits and I agree that they should be. Nonetheless, it's good to have them explicitly stated.

As for optics you raise excellent points. My fear was that were the clip to somehow become circulated or the incident to become high profile that maybe it would convince members of the public to be anti-choice. However you're right, it could be used educationally to demonstrate the barbarism of how we presently handle mental health and CTB.

The labeling point is very important and I feel both guilty and stupid for not thinking of it. I agree completely, although it does raise logistical questions, especially given risk of platform interference and the like.

Ethics and Optics of Livestreaming CTB?,2662323,HereIGoAgain24,"Sep 8, 2024 at 3:41 AM","First off- where are you planning to livestream? Don't nearly all the major outlets have pretty stringent rules against this (and the bots/moderators to instantly take them down)? Correct me if I'm wrong on this one.

As far as ethics... well, that's a murky subject I need to read more on. My own thinking is that (assuming it's not taken down immediately) the internet is FAR too vast a place to judge the harm or help that it would do. Some people might see it and find it a helpful way to understand what CTB would look like and decide whether it's right for them. Others might see it and use it as fuel to clamp down even more on the movement. And then there's the emotional distress it may cause others. It's extremely difficult for me to say.

As far as optics? Almost certain to be harmful. CTB is still a MASSIVE no-no for 99% of the population, including media outlets and the like. Publicizing a death for the movement really wouldn't help (I've seen people publicly kill themselves for other movements, and it's led to nothing). At best, you get a bunch of news articles denouncing this and further clampdowns from outlets.

I can't imagine this working out well. I think the best we can do is try to shepherd people who may benefit from the movement to this site (in ways that wouldn't attract serious attention from others), and hope that eventually, the stars align for the movement to really catch on.

Of course, all of this is my own speculation.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I highly appreciate this post. And yeah, some of this is what I feared. That it may not just be useless but actively harmful to the pro-choice movement. As for the difficulty in gauging harm you raise a strong point. I was considering streaming it on one of the shit-can services like Kick or Rumble but given the points you raise it's mire doubtful as to whether I do it.

,2661126,greyblue_bian,"Sep 7, 2024 at 2:44 AM","Update: I forgot to post yesterday. But, nothing happened. I've only tried cleaning around my house but that's about it. I still need to finish my note and I finally started it not too long ago, but I've run out of energy again to continue writing it. I also feel the need to tell my life story over again, I think in an effort to try to re-claim it my own before I go. I know for a fact there will be a lot said after I'm gone and the people who'll be doing the most talking and the least (somehow at the same time) will be the people who have done the most damage. I've been pushed off the edge. I've been abused for long enough and I am tired. Life is not easy and I am weak. But, I still tried. I did try. I tried listening to others' guidance and I even tried listening to my own in spite of the ""loop"" my life seems to be on. I've tried getting better multiple times and made my efforts at surviving and obviously, I've just barely survived everything. I made my attempts obviously. And the only thing I regret is them not succeeding. I could've avoided so much if I had died the first time. Because of what's happened, I've given up entirely to the point where I've put myself in dangerous and self-harming and humiliating situations I wouldn't have before because I've been forced to forget who I am. I have been shown it's not important, that it will never matter more than who other people think I am does. I tried ""reviving"" myself, but I don't have any interest anymore. The only reasons I have pro-longed my life is because of my friends, because of my two cousins who are basically like siblings to me. They are the only people who care. They have been the only people to treat me like a human being. With them, I am safe. They are safe. Things are calm and things are healthy. They do what they can for me and I try my best to do what I can as well. I know it's not much. They claim otherwise but I'm just hopeful I've been helpful somehow.

I still wait around for the apologies I think I ""deserve"" and have ignored everyone telling me that karma is real in efforts to get me to let my guard down. It contradicts them also telling me to forgive them without an apology. But if I'm making this about deserving, they don't deserve it. I always thought that I never knew or was taught how to forgive or just that I wasn't capable of it, but that's proven not to be true. I know how to forgive someone who's wronged me because I've done it before with a proper apology. With the people who have wronged me and apologized taking accountability for what they've done entirely and I've been able to move on. That's been something that is really rare for me to come by. I haven't experienced it from family. I have only experienced it once or maybe twice from people outside. Other than that, it has been blaming me for being weak, blaming what has happened to them to excuse them abusing me, constantly coming up with excuses as to why it was and will never be their fault. So, resentment has only built up and simmered. It's died down and boiled back over the top and I'm sure they get something out of it.

Some have said they are sorry, followed up with why I am to blame for them cheating. For them emotionally and mentally abusing me and threatening to beat me in a ""joke"". I've heard ""I'm sorry"" followed up with the fact they are not perfect for them physically beating me (with a belt) for things that were not my fault since I was child. They would apologize afterwards, promising it would never happen again and things would improve, things would change and it would only happen again. They get angry at me for being skeptical at them for everything. For staying on my guard around them even though I don't have any reason not to. They have scared me into submission. I don't fight or I didn't fight for a long time. They are the same person to criticize me after attempting, downplaying my reasons along with my cousins who have tried as well. They've failed to defend me in arguments with other family when they know I'm speaking the truth and told me to comply with them; Their only reason being that we would move out of their house soon and that I should comply until then. That we would continue to run away. When it comes to family, detaching and letting go is more than difficult. My family has denied me everything they've done to me and my siblings or downplayed it. I've said everything that needs to be said to them and don't miss being in that situation. I have never been apologized to for the rape and sexual abuse I've gone through with others when I was a child and I don't wait around for them to apologize. I don't wait around for them to say they did what they did.

Now, I am tired and I don't have anymore care to continue living. It takes an effort just to choose to get better and it takes strength and want to continue living. I don't have that anymore.

It's easiest for me to take the blame, even though I falter in and out of it as my emotions go up and down on everything that's happened in my life. When you've seen your parent get abused and then they abuse you, it is hard to get angry. It is hard not to be to at least try being there with them physically so they are reminded they aren't alone. But I have had little to no sympathy from them about the abuse I have been out through and they nearly went as far to say that it was my fault, that I've allowed them to do what they did to me, I chose to let them do it (specifically referring to me being emotionally abused and cheated on).",,,,,,,,,,,,

I think being cheated on has un-done a lot of progress I made. I think the most surprising thing it's done to me is make me hate my skin color and race. I was cheated on with a white girl and he also spoke with only other white girls, even including his female friends. Even if they were not white, they pass as white. I can't. I'm Asian, Black, and Hispanic. I'm not dark-skinned or very brown. I'm relatively light-skinned but not enough to pass. In grade school, I went through what I've heard a lot of other people of color go through at least at once in their lives which is their phase of trying to look white. But, I really wanted to be it.

I wanted to get my hands on Kojic Acid soap and I would hyperventilate if my mom said she couldn't straighten my hair before I left for school or if I didn't have enough time to do my makeup before school. It eventually got to the point where I genuinely couldn't tell if I was looking back at myself in the mirror or at someone else. I don't miss that time. Anyways, by now I have cut off the friends who ruined my esteem and I did find friends who made me feel more secure in my own race and color. I was happy and I was proud to be who I was.


I'm not saying being cheated on has ruined that entirely because I do sometimes feel proud to be who I am racially, but a lot of the time, I feel like there's a lot of self-hate and shame lingering. Unfortunately, I wish I could hide my color sometimes so that some white male would accept me with more than sexual intent. I feel like that's all that will happen at the end of the day. I will not be white enough. I am not good enough, and I can always be better, I can always give more. Sometimes, I still feel like ripping my own skin off, I find it repulsive to look at when I see myself sometimes. It only reminds me of what's happened. I'm not saying that it's other people of color who I think are ugly, it's that I am not. I think it's just me hating myself and that's it's me I hate seeing. I can't even look at myself without being reminded of everything that's happened and I can't take it anymore.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2661537,helpsh,"Sep 7, 2024 at 11:30 AM","I feel ready because I can't see a way out of all the situations I'm in but I've been in them for so long and it'll never change.

I'm in my late twenties living with my parents due to debt, my parents are awful and caused me a lot of trauma but I can't afford to move out cause of debt (that I build up when using money as a coping mechanism) and the more I stay the more I want to indulge in addictive behaviours which keeps me in a cycle.

I'm in an abusive relationship I'm codependent on and it's made impossible for me to leave.

I have a good job but also severe autism where it makes me have anxiety attacks and embarrass myself regularly due to lack of confidence and not understanding situations. This is the best paying job I've had so I need it to help with the debt but it makes me hate myself and shows how incompetent and stupid I am.

I'm constantly making mistakes even when I'm careful and double checking things because my brain is so scattered and because of anxiety.

In an ideal world I would stay in a room by myself and never speak to anyone, but I'm forced to have to work, and my parents don't give me any privacy and treat me like a child.

I can't see a way out of it and think I'm not meant for this world. I have felt like this since I was 10 years old because I've always felt misplaced and I can't understand people or maintain healthy relationships, I always think I'm misunderstood and people are against me and I just come across so badly and don't understand so much.",2661528,,,,,,,,,,,
,2661558,hellworldprincess,"Sep 7, 2024 at 11:55 AM","I'm so sorry for the situation you're in and I hope you have some coping mechanics to ease your pain even if it only helps only for a minute or two.

If you are able to get some kind of professional help I would obviously suggest you seek it. But if that's out of the question I understand.

Are there any support networks for neurodivergent people in your community? Are there support groups for people in abusive relationships? Can you ask anyone who's also struggling with mental health issues for advice?

I'm sorry if I recommended anything you've already tried. I know that nothing has a 100% chance of helping you get into a better situation, but I think that you're a person who may be in a very bad place who still might make it. Even if the odds are against you. Even if your survival is based purely in spite.

I know that a job is nothing to really hold onto in bad circumstances, but if it's a 'good job' maybe you can use your financial freedom to get away from some of the things you're struggling with by moving or something.

If you feel weak right now, I want you to know that you can be strong. If you feel hopeless, maybe there's something you haven't tried. If you've tried everything, I hope you're certain about that.

Making mistakes is okay. Suicide is only the last resort.

But the fear of not losing consciousness and hang there for several minutes in extreme pain until i eventually suffocate have made me consider snorting some heroin and wait untill it kicks in and then step of to hopefully take away most of the horrible pain on the throat and overall just numb me down, and who knows, maybe it will knock me out and i won't even have to feel the hanging part.

But then another worry emerge, and that is that nausea and vomiting isn't that uncommon from stronger opioids, and if i won't lose consciousness and my body starts to try ane vomit when the rope cuts of my throat/air supply, i quess that it would result in that the vomit would end up in my lunges, making those minutes untill i pass out from suffocating even worse/painful. So do you guys believe taking an antiemetic drug like promethazine an hour or so before the heroin would prevent this?

Another alternative would be alcohol, but not to the point were i get super drunk and dizzy, but it's not a near as potent painkiller as heroin. So how would you guys go about this? Odds are that the rope will cut off the blood supply to my head and make me lose consciousness in seconds, but then again, there's cases were this doesn't happen amd you just suffocate.",,,,,,,,,,,,

So, yes, I find it strange that there is absolutely no one in the entire world who would be willing to sell veterinary pentobarbital secretly to other people.

Sorry its long, i divided it into parts so you can skip stuf you dont wanna read, if you wanna help.

Original plan:
Well for some months i was planning to go a gun range and shoot myself, but didnt work out.
Everything was nice first, i heard ill need a shooting buddy, cuz ranges dont want to rent guns to people when they are alone, cuz of people like me. I wanted to go with my family for my next birthday and my uncle agreed.
I wanted to shoot myself at my birthday but that didnt work out, but no problem, we gone like a month later, yesterday, well he bring with himself my younger cousin.
I got over and made my mind okey with the fact that people would see me die, even my uncle, cuz they will be old, they could manage, especially him, even tho it made me kinda sad he would see it, but he is strong and he seen some stuf.
But the cousin, he is in middle school i believe, he has it hard enough and will have it harder, i know. i was scared this would make him want to do it also.
But i got over it, well we get the guns, i masked my stress and fear wonderfully i think, noone could tell a thing. I got three revolvers. My plan was shoot from the first to get a grip how it works (so i dont point to my head, pull the trigger and nothing happens, that would be akward...), then either shoot myself from the second or third.

Why it didnt work:
Well the gun staff officer or whatever he is, was glued to me.
One of my friends goes to gun ranges regurarly ( i asked him alot of questions ), when he shoots, the safety guy is like 2 metres behind him, but with me he was on the right, next to me, the whole time, If i would try i would hit him or he would quickly grab the gun, also my cousin was waiting in the stall on my left... If i would shoot myself to the temple the bullet could exit my head and shoot him. Well i just let it be and enjoyed my time there, it was kinda nice, i shot from 45 caliber revolver i think, it was big and strong.

Concenquences/Aftermath:
Well i have problems now, i was really planning to do it, maybe if i would try i would succed. I thought i wont have future so i lived a life for few months especially the last weeks, like i wouldnt face the consequences.
I didnt do anything to school, which is a huge problem.
I had to read books and do work on some projects, i didnt, i also should have worked at the post office at the end of summer, but i just didnt, i had arguments with my family more than ever, sometimes i was mean, but to people which made me wanna do the thing. I didnt care about my partner i just wanted their touch and attention and love, i was little bit mean and sometimes too needy and handsy and even inappropriate. One of my friends doesnt even wanna talk to me anymore, also blocked on social media.

Positives:
On the positive side i shot from a huge revolver and the officer said for a newbie i managed it well! I rewatched and seen many anime i seen when i was little and wanted to see it again or always wanted to see, but never got the time, i seen Ghost in the shell, Paranoia agent, Paprika, Tokyo godfathers,The girl who leapt through time, millenium actress, many more and FLCL(which kinda changed my view on life), i downloaded doom and some other games from sus links, cuz i wanted to try again before i die, i didnt care about viruses, i should have been ded. i was hanging more with my friends and had some wonderfull times. I never was a drinker and i hated smoking (my grandfather, who was an amazing person and who raised me, cuz my father was gone for a half of my life, died too soon thanks to smoking his whole life and my mother smokes, shes mean to me). But i tried cigaretts and alcohol, i enjoyed both. I binge listened to most music that i ever loved, i tried many new foods.

And yesterday was so beatifull, we gone at night so i had whole day. I was walking through my city and nature, listening to music, the sky was just beautifull, it was sad but happy, melancholic, nostalgic, wonderfull, it was the most beautifull day of my life, i never felt so happy and so full, i felt so at peace, i was happy with my life, i felt satisfied with it, this was the last day of my life.

What now
But i am here, i still wanna die, i have some options.

1. the gun range again and maybe next time the officer will be further away. Tho i think the next time ill be able to will be at christmass, so ill have to wait and ehm, i will be roasted in school and more.

2. Theres a bridge near where i live, its pretty low, but there are cars driving under it. I would probably have to try to time it right to get hit by a car. This bridge has wonderfull view on my city, when sun sets, even at day and at night, i sometimes just stay there and look, people driving under me must think i wanna jump. Heh

3. I can buy a rope, but i dont know whats good or not, i read some threads and posts but idk. At the moment the only rope i found i could buy is from a sport shop thats far away. (But i think the walk would be nice if i would wanna do it the same day. I could go to the more of end of the day to catch a nice sunset on the way back through the nature and even pass some nice spots, with nice views or memories.)
Its a climbing rope, kinda thin and maybe made from some synthetic material, it looks streatchy, maybe plastic? Idk. And i dont have much spots where to hang myself + they are not perfect:
a)in my room on doorknob

b)in house under wooden beam, theres alot but somebody could save me

c)in forest, but with my luck i could choose a spot where i walk everyday and spot nobody but on that particular day the police and paramedics would just decide to go on a walk and find me

d)drop from the bridge with a noose around my neck?

Well, got any suggestions, help, advice?
also sorry if this was too long. Thanks in advance to anyone for anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, I expect someone from your family would still be called to identify you but, they would be going in knowing that's what they were about to do. They wouldn't just be walking into the living room or wherever you would plan to do it at home. I doubt- following that they would be able to dissasociate that room with that sight.

The only thing I can think of where it may be of more comfort would be a sense that they wish they could have been there right at the end. Sometimes, you do get the sense that loved ones want to be able to do stuff for their family members- even after death. Maybe it helps with closure or something.

I have been giving more thought to the futility of life recently. No matter what we do, all will be lost at the moment of death. All the knowledge, skills and lessons learnt throughout life are all wasted upon death.

You may be a person who makes a considerable difference to later generations (for better or worse) and you may be remembered for these things by the following generations. But given a long enough timeline all your actions and those that remember them will be forgotten (taken to the extreme - when earth is incinerated by the sun once it has used all of it's fuel). Even if the effects of your actions in life are still felt by those that have no idea who you were, or what you did, does that really matter? as far as I can see it doesn't.

Some aspects of their lives may have been influenced by you, but what sort of achievement is that? not much of one in the face of all that was lost when you died and the fact that the people you have influenced are just existing themselves without any real ultimate direction or goal. Is the goal here to somehow have a tangible effect on following generations? it seems quite a hollow and pointless aim.

There will be no record of most of us in a short amount of time, no one will ever know we existed or what we did. Does it not follow then that life is quite futile? no matter what you do, even if it is relatively significant, it will still not really matter.

I suppose to continue the discussion one has to ask what would be a potential goal or purpose to existence? and I have no answer for that. Perhaps that means that there is simply no purpose, life and existence really is pointless and futile. So I wonder why it is that we thought there should be a purpose at all?

It is at this point that I think existence/life takes on less of a special place in the hierarchy of natural phenomena and the universe. It would appear we exist merely to continue to exist. There is no goal or purpose, we just continue living for the sake of living.

Some will undoubtedly reply to this with ""The purpose should be to improve the quality of others' lives"" or something to that affect. But this rings hollow in light of the above. It is just life perpetuating life for the sake of it. No truly worthy reason or goal.

What are everyone's thoughts?",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2657313,Forever Sleep,"Sep 4, 2024 at 3:28 AM","What difference will it make to you- when you're dead- how many lives you impacted? Depends entirely on what you believe I suppose. Whether you believe that we can experience anything after death to even know. Plus- whether that is what life is supposed to be about anyway.

I think everything is so individual. Some people desperately want to achieve in life and become famous/infamous. Others are perfectly happy to live modest, quiet lives. The only time they're going to be unhappy is when they don't achieve their aim. Either someone who desperately wanted recognition didn't get it. Didn't do Van Gogh much good to be so highly praised after his death. On the other hand, there have been cases where people have been catapulted into the lime light because of something random and, they hated the experience.

But no, personally, I don't think it matters. My Mum was a relative nobody. She had an average job and an average life. She died when I was 3. That still matters to me. It will continue to matter to me and likely, all the people that still remember her until we all die off. It would be simply bizarre though if the entire world mourned her or anyone else forever more.

Maybe a handful of people will be eternal. Through their work/legacy/documented history- Elvis for example. That's kind of rare though and, it's not exactly personal. It's maybe limerence in a way- adoration/obsession of a person from afar that we only think we know.

Really though, the experience of life is going on individually billions of times over. What and who is important to you doesn't matter at all to someone else. Do we need to all agree for that person to actually be important? Surely not. It's nice if maybe a handful of people value us or, what we've done but, anything more is kind of unrealistic to hope for for a lot of us.

Plus, does our self worth rely entirely on what other people think of us? Both while we're alive and after? Sadly, to a greater extent, maybe it does. We need people to value what we do at work in order to pay us and not sack us and fame relies on having fans. I still think it's largely down to what bothers the individual though. Only they can actually answer whether their life feels meaningful to them- regardless of how other people see it.

Really though. I think this all boils down to- does it matter what you think and feel? What any of us think and feel? I'd say- yes. That's why we have things like laws to prevent people really hurting one another. Because, our own experiences of life matter to us while we're alive and we have to recognise that right for other people. Whenever they lived and, whoever was important to them. It's more the feeling itself- rather than what the feeling is about. We have a developed sense of being able to remember and appreciate other people and their achievements.

Plus, even if no one actually remembers who created the first wheel, we all benefit from their ingenuity. Maybe we can't all be that clever and revolutionary but, heigh-ho.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2657385,sancta-simplicitas,"Sep 4, 2024 at 5:39 AM","I believe that existance in itself is fundamentally meaningless. Every member of a species exists for the evolutionary purpose of survival and procreation, which is also meaningless because the only outcome procreation leads to is another individual that exists for no other reason than survival and procreation. That being said, I believe that humans have the ability to create meaning from where there is none. After all we were the ones who invented the concept of meaning in the first place. I personally tend to find meaning in creating things with my hands, nurturing other humans (or animals) and engaging in various forms of art. On a universal level, these things are fundamentally meaningless, on an individual level they aren't, because I myself have assigned meaning to them.

Regarding the part where all your knowledge and skills just cease to exist in the moment of your death, I don't think that's fully true. Humans share their thoughts and skills all the time, sometimes without being consciously aware of it. I like to believe that those things spread. A tiny, little thing can have a ripple effect beyond our immediate comprehension. For example, in 1982 an American guy figured out that :) looks like a smiling face if you tilt your head to the left. Fast forward 42 years and humanity has collectively created a whole new language for the second time in our collective history, what makes it even more interesting is that it's universal. That has never happened before (at least to my knowledge) and it all started with just one person. So there really is no waste to acquiring knowledge and skills in my opinion. You never know how it's going to affect the world. Sometimes for good, sometimes for bad. But it is likely to spread beyond you.",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2657433,chester,"Sep 4, 2024 at 6:49 AM","I think I've used this analogy in another thread, but I like to go bring it up.

Video games are pointless. You don't achieve anything that's worth anything in real life (I'm not talking about professional gamers who make money). You spend time and effort on practicing skills, solving puzzles and fighting opponents for absolutely nothing. Technically speaking, not only do you not gain anything, you sacrifice your most valuable resource - time. Not to mention that many good games are quite expensive.
And yet, hundreds of millions of people worldwide play video games. Why? Because they like the experience and the satisfaction it brings. They don't mind that playing a video game is objectively pointless, who cares? Games can be difficult, they can make you frustrated, but it's the satisfaction of overcoming these difficulties which pays off in the end when you see the end credits.

That's precisely why I used to love my life. It didn't matter that there was no point. I wanted to live it. Now I feel I've done my part, the credits rolled, there's no more game I'd like to play. I'm done.

I don't believe having an impact matters a lot. I mean it may matter to humanity, but it won't matter to the person who dies. As Woody Allen said:

I don't want to achieve immortality through my work; I want to achieve immortality through not dying. I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen; I want to live on in my apartment.

And I would agree with him, if I still considered my life worth living. But I've reached a point in which irreversible damage has been done and the suffering will never be outweighed by anything that could possibly happen.

I think the bottom line is: yes, existence is pointless. But when your life is good, it doesn't matter. It only matters, when your suffering makes you want to quit. If there was a point to life, then maybe it would still be worth to grit your teeth and wait for natural death. Otherwise, I don't see a point in prolonging the suffering.",,,,,,,,,,,,

We eat to avoid the effects of being hungry and starvation, we have hobbies to avoid being bored . We drink to avoid being parched. We have romantic partners so we don't suffer loneliness .

I agree with Ethical Hedonism claim that only pleasure has worth or value and only pain or displeasure has disvalue or the opposite of worth. So maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain is the ultimate goal of life. Pursuing pleasure and avoiding pain for oneself or others are the ultimate expressions of ethical good. Suffering is more negative than pleasure is positive, suffering is the stronger of the two values. So if there's no pleasure or more suffering than pleasure in life, life isn't worth living anymore ┐(⇀‸↼‶)┌

In my opinion involving a train driver is just passing your pain to them, yes they get time off work paid (in my country) but they also then have to go through a long process of dealing with the trauma they've been involved in. The one that particularly sticks in my mind is the driver telling me the man jumped out from the bushes ran onto the track faced the train before turning round at the last minute and being splattered all over the windscreen, that driver was absolutely beside himself.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Somebody I can truly be myself around and let my guard down is where I am most at home. Sadly, most women I have been with took advantage of this to get their way and I lost a lot of say in the relationships because I feared losing them. Then when they left I'd be a complete mess.

I've had two ""successful"" relationships out of many that lasted over 5 years and one that lasted around 3 years, and a lot that lasted anywhere from 3-6 months and in regards to the longer relationships they generally failed because I got too comfortable, I knew I was good looking and a good talker but I lacked emotional intelligence and couldn't see the cues when they happened and when I could things were generally too late because most women checked out by the time things started going downhill.

I blame some of the failures on me being too open about my thoughts and emotions, I can be too straightforward about such things while I have the opposite problem when it comes to more tangible things.

I just grow too content when the house is in good shape, the bills are paid, there are groceries in the fridge, and there are regular date nights and sex. I lacked spontaneity which I've learned many women require but I failed to offer. Also, many I dated tended to be quite awful with budgeting and I feel as though the excess spending was either a way to make things more interesting as stress mixes things up a bit, or was a way to milk me of some money while looking for the next ""Mr. Right' before leaving when finding him and then repeating the process.

But yes, love is extremely vital to me and without it I tend to be at my lowest, I basically require companionship and regardless of how long I take time for myself that void just grows and grows until I kind of shut myself out from the world before I find someone new who will usually just leave me once I bring up my feelings because I tend to put everything out there and most people (even those who have been suicidal) tend to just immediately suggest therapy or pills and when I tell them I've been down that road multiple times they distance themselves from me.",2661924,,,,,,,,,,,

Putting its general glamorization of self-harm aside, who exactly is its target audience? The majority of its demographic seems to be made up of teenage girls and young women. While it does rightfully belong with the other twt self-harm communities (edtwt, goretwt, and drugtwt), it feels wayyyy too flashy for the ""average"" viewer. Like, if I were to interact with such a community, it would be to vent about my temptations to sh, and the desire to appear even ""sicker,"" not to see hit tweets of suggestive videos featuring topless young women cutting inches away from their breasts. It makes me think that some of these videos might have a sexual element to them. Intended or not.

Cutting is typically an intimate activity that's done alone without prying eyes, so seeing someone in such a vulnerable position feels kind of voyeuristic. Like, ten times over. It feels like some sort of sleazy T.V show. It kind of bothers me that some people get off to this without ever being in the shoes of someone suffering so much pain, both physically and emotionally.

Surface level shtwt is what you see, the biggest commu in it are mutual safekeeping and empathy, some have an addiction and some just need somewhere they can honestly express their pain or what they are going through with similar people who may have alternatives.

That's why it's even more painful to live with this chronic illness, that I developed for no reason besides bad luck. I could have gotten married, had a family, been a good father. I could have had a good, fulfilling career. But instead I live in a black pit of depression and pain, with my intestines squirming like a snake stuck inside my body. Half the time I stand up after sitting, I almost black out. My hands and wrists have shooting nerve pain.

And I'm sentenced to live for decades longer, as the person I am and the person I could have been grow ever further apart. The hope I feel sometimes about recovery is just a cruel trick played by my animal nature, which wants to stay alive despite intolerable living circumstances.

All the anxiety and hopelessness I felt in the past, before my diagnosis, was justified. The worst possible thing I could have imagined came true.

I want it to be over, but I'm not nearly depressed enough to ever take the step toward suicide.

Not sure if you're looking for suggestions or if they'll even work but have heard some topical creams can be helpful for nerve pains. Supposedly ALA, PEA and Benfotiamine as well though with the benfo you have to be extremely careful and follow Dr. Lonsdale and Elliot Overton's protocol titrating up low and slow first with water soluble then fat soluble thiamine.

I never have had any ambition whatsoever and didn't even want to be born in the first place. Basically every negative event in my life could have been prevented if I just put forth some more effort.

The problem is that even if I force myself to give my all to something, be it with family, a job, a serious relationship or anything else I eventually rest on my laurels and everything goes to hell.

I'm not even mad about this anymore and have come to accept it as a universal truth in regards to myself that cannot be remedied and I must live with and accept such.

Which is why I've resigned myself to just being alone and living in a small rental and just doing what I must do to keep things functioning at this basic level.

Already in the process of acquiring SN and have a good 10-15 days until it gets here but I'm not sure when I'm going to use it yet. I'm pretty much done with this existence but I guess I'm going to wait for one final push. I might put in a good amount of effort into trying a final time with love and if it works I'll always have SN on hand and if it fails I'll just have that much more reason to go through with it. I have no doubt I can muster up the willpower but I just want it to feel right, like I did my best and failed anyways.

I already know from experience that things will go awry because despite being a bit better at talking to others than most and handsome I tend to talk too much and sometimes I lack tact and misread emotions which leads to overstepping boundaries.

My father is the same way so I think I inherited this from him but he lucked out with my mother because they've been married for over 30 years and she puts up with his shortcomings and he does the same for her (as should be the case in a perfect world) but sadly, most people are extremely quick to throw everything away after a single argument or miscommunication these days due to people being accustomed to instant gratification and having shorter attention spans than ever, as well as dating sites being a thing.

You can always just move on to the next prospect so why bother if any red flags show themselves?

It's extremely rare to find a romantic partner who is willing to accept less than perfect, which is why most relationships fail so often. I've dated well over 20 women in my life and had serious relations with 3 of them, 2 of which lasted over 5 years each.

Lidocaine / Bisoprolol advice,2455600,Time4Peace,"Apr 10, 2024 at 8:27 AM","Hi everyone,

I have OTC access to Lidocaine / Bisoprolol. Have researched a little bit and it seems that Lidocaine at lethal doses, like 1g or even less gets you a cardiac arrest, while Bisoprolol has more side effects.

Can anyone share more details about these methods? I don't have the search function yet, but the suggested threads that popped up didn't give much info.

Here are some sources about the lethality of Lidocaine:
""The cause of death was determined to be ventricular arrhythmia precipitated by lidocaine overdosage. The administered dose was calculated to have been approximately 1500 mg.""
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12353561/

""The overdose of lidocaine produces death from ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest. In this case, according to macroscopic and microscopic findings, the cause of death was most likely cardiac and possibly related to ventricular fibrillation.""
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379073806002775
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16787726/

""A 78-year-old woman committed double suicide with a bolus injection of 1 g of lidocaine hydrochloride.
These results indicated that the cardiac failure should have occurred immediately after the lidocaine injection.""
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12935451/

""Two cases of fatal lidocaine intoxication were presented to our center. The first case was a male with a history of multiple drug abuse who suffered from generalized seizures followed by cardiopulmonary arrest after oral ingestion of lidocaine spray. The second case was a female who suffered from generalized seizures followed by cardiopulmonary arrest""

""Is injecting lidocaine intravenously a painless death?""
Answer by:

Douglas Johnson

MD in Surgery, Wayne State University School of Medicine (Graduated 1983)
Uncomfortable but probably painless. It would not cause any sensation except dizziness and then your heart goes into an arrhythmia and, with a large enough dose, it stops.
https://www.quora.com/Is-injecting-lidocaine-intravenously-a-painless-death

Additional answers from the same link above:
""Death depends on the dosage. Doctors use IV lidocaine to treat Arrhythmia. But the effects may show up earlier if we use it on the patient with normal sinus rhythm. If we achieve the toxic dose patient will have severe arrhythmia followed by cardiac arrest. So injecting lidocaine intravenously will surely cause death. But I don't know how painful it would be.""

""IV Lidocaine will cause neurological effects well before it causes cardiovascular instability.
Unlike mucosal, intradermal or subcutaneous lidocaine, which all sting quite significantly, injecting lidocaine intravenously does not normally hurt.
Typical side effects of lidocaine toxicity are pins-and-needles, especially around the lips and tongue, agitation/confusion and tremors progressing to seizures and then loss of consciousness. Only at higher levels do you get arrhythmia and cardiovascular collapse.""

""In The Netherlands we use 100mg/ml (10%) to make i.v. solutions with; infusion speed (after administering a bolus injection of 100 mg using the 2% solution) would usually be 2 mg/minute.

I remember a nurse who newly joined the coronary care unit who mistakenly administered this 10% solution, instead of the standard 2% solution which at that time look just alike, and injected this into a patient's vein, this was followed by a cardiac arrest, fortunately after external chest compressions the patient regained a normal heart rhythm and woke up. After this event we kept the 10% solution in a big ampoule, but the 2% solution only in a prefilled syringe, so no mistaking which was which.

I think unwittingly administering such a high concentration at a more than ten times higher rate then was intended caused the cardiac arrest, but didn't kill the patient.""

P.S. I have access to OTC 100mg/ml (10%) IV solution, each ampule is 2ml and the pack has ten of them. I can pretty sure hit 1g or even more for instant lights out.

Would like to hear more of course from anyone who can add anything else that I might be missing, for example, bad side effects, tips how to do it, additional supplemental medicine, etc.

Using lidocaine together with bisoprolol may increase the effects of lidocaine.

Bisoprolol might affect how lidocaine is cleared from your body. This can cause lidocaine toxicity.

The serum concentration of Lidocaine can be increased when it is combined with Bisoprolol.

the Propofol will knock me out and the Lidocaine will give a proper cardiac arrest?
Can I inject it really fast to my arm with a syringe?
Appreciate your help!

EDIT: these are 10ml bottles so the dosage is 500mg for each component. Researching now how much would be a lethal dosage, maybe 1000mg each? Two bottles basically.

EDIT#2: Looks like rapid injection of 20ml under 10 seconds is possible!

""20 ml is a pretty standard volume for many drugs that need diluting, like antibiotics

i spend all day injecting propofol from a 20 ml syringe as fast as it'll go—-less than 10seconds usually.

we also use 30ml and 50ml suringes on occasion

Lidocaine / Bisoprolol advice,2463974,Sunset Limited,"Apr 14, 2024 at 6:06 PM","Sorry but lidocaine + bisoprolol bad idea. Amide local anesthetics such as lidocaine are strong negative inotropes. A sufficient dose stops the heart, but the problem is that it also crosses the blood brain barrier. CNS effects begin before cardiac effects. You will have convulsions. I have written many times before that veterinarians never use lidocaine alone in euthanasia. A strong sedative is injected first.

The only way to stop the heart before the onset of CNS effects is to inject the maximum concentration of lidocaine solution very quickly. Still no warranty. So don't do it. Selective beta blockers such as bisoprolol and metoprolol also cross the blood-brain barrier and depress the CNS.

If my goal was to stop the heart, I would use digoxin or a calcium channel blocker. Calcium channel blockers are as potent as beta blockers, but their CNS effects are limited. The most dangerous is digoxin. A fast bolus of high concentration would probably stop the heart instantly.

With 500 mg propofol + 500 mg lidocaine you are talking about Anestofol. This is an approved drug for animal euthanasia. 2 vials 20 cc = 1g propofol + 1g lidocaine. This is enough for a completely peaceful death. 20 cc of fluid can be pushed through a large vein in 10 seconds.

Thank you in advance!",,,,,,,,,,,,
Lidocaine / Bisoprolol advice,2518191,Sunset Limited,"May 13, 2024 at 5:06 PM","Hey my friend. If it was standard propofol, I would recommend not adding anything to it. Because propofol is a hydrophobic phenol, it is insoluble in water and soluble in oil. We cannot inject oil directly into the blood, so it is emulsified. Nothing else should be mixed into the propofol emulsion because the emulsion may break.

I have little information about Anestofol. I wonder how they combine propofol and lidocaine. It could be an emulsion or just oil. Since it was a euthanasia, they may have ignored the consequences of injecting oil into the bloodstream. If it is just oil, then it is not a good idea to add lidocaine dissolved in water because they will not mix in the syringe due to their specific gravity. Still, if you hold the syringe upright with the plunger down, you inject the anestofol first and then the lidocaine. This is an acceptable scenario, but still hypothetical. If anestofol is an emulsion, you should not add anything to it.

In this case, the best way to use anestofol and additional lidocaine is to attach a double lumen to the catheter, inject first the anestofol and then the lidocaine with two syringes through two infusion lines with injection ports.

I couldn't understand two pieces and three pieces syringes. Photos can help. Also, if I see a photo of anestofol, maybe I can understand whether it is oil or emulsion.",,,,,,,,,,,,

From what I've seen though, these indian pharmacies that ship without a prescription tend to be very reliable for shipping into the US (barring the sketchy scam sites). Some of them are even marketed towards US residents looking for cheaper drugs. Some pharmacies even falsely label their shipments, like the OP mentioned, so customs doesn't have any reason to go snooping in the package (DMC, the SN source most users are using, also does this with SN).

"How to ""get into"" guns?",2644804,newlifeimmigration,"Aug 25, 2024 at 5:45 AM","I know there's already a thread about guns specifically for ctb. I've already read it and I'll probably reread it a few times again. What I'm wondering is about how to start getting knowledge on guns in general?

Shotgun to the head is my ideal method. I have the money for it and everything but I feel like I need more knowledge on them before actually going out and buying one. I want to know enough that I could act like I'm just getting into it as a hobby. And also I have no idea on how to even shoot one. I have genuine interest in guns too, I just feel kind of lost on how to start learning about them. Every time I try looking stuff up all the logistics just go over my head.

It feels like everyone else learned from being around family or friends with guns, but my family has always been really against guns. And I dont have any friends. I'm a very scrawny girl who is very visibly maladjusted & improperly socialized too so I don't feel like I really fit in with the average gun owner. It makes me nervous about even trying because I feel like I'm just going to make a fool of myself

It's kind of open I guess but my questions are:
does anyone have any tips on how to not look like you're just buying a gun just to ctb?
What can I expect from going into a gun store?
Is there any good starting resources for learning about shotguns, so I don't look like an idiot?
What do people usually do with shotguns? I know there's hunting and shooting ranges but I'm kind of confused on what that actually entails irl

Thank you^^",,,,,,,,,,,,

"How to ""get into"" guns?",2647469,hellworldprincess,"Aug 27, 2024 at 10:39 AM","I've never held a gun before and also I couldn't in my country, so take all of this with a grain of salt.

If you're generally interested in guns, there are countless gun nut youtubers you could check out. Sadly, they tend to not be the nicest people around. Being into guns is kind of a right-wing coded hobby. But for education about functionality and vocabulary it should be fine.

I assume that you're based in the US, which has something called the gun show loophole. For example it's used by felons to buy guns.
If you look for a private seller (maybe at a gun show) you might find someone who isn't as responsible as a professional gun salesperson.

Honestly tho, I think that most gun shops also don't care.

You could say that you want to use it at a shooting range (idk anything about hunting at all so I can't tell you how that would work), but if you don't have experience holding a gun, that might be suspicious. The seller could advise you to start off with something smaller than a shotgun.
That's why I would say that I want to own it for home defense purposes. Gun people love all of that ""my home is my castle"" stuff.

Hope this helps in some kind of way.",,,,,,,,,,,,
"How to ""get into"" guns?",2661769,scubadam,"Sep 7, 2024 at 3:43 PM","hey! i'm from a country where the process of getting a gun is extremely difficult, but i've been to a shooting range a few times and have an idea how i would do it

first, i would start by going to a shooting range once or twice. they might ask about registration which is normal (at least here), i'd be honest with my personal information. they shouldn't ask for a reason you're coming there, but if they do i'd say something like ""i want to get a gun for defense and know how to use it beforehand"" or ""i want to better understand hobbies of my boyfriend/brother/father/etc."". they shouldn't ask further, but if they do, know that shotguns are made for use from a small distance, eg. hunting small animals (ducks, rabbits, etc.) or self defense. if you can afford it, get an instructor and ask questions so you seem to really want to get into that stuff. at first they won't give you a shotgun probably, but you can say that there is one in your family house and you would like to learn how to use it in a case you need to or this is the main weapon the person you want to hunt/talk about it uses.

then, when you get to use a shotgun even once, go to a gun store and say a story that your house was attacked not so long ago (a robbery or something) but due to your neighbors walking around you got out of the situation safely and you'd like to own a shotgun if something like that happens again and nobody near is there to help OR again, the story about getting into a hobby of a close one. you mentioned you're a 'scrawny' girl, thus i'd assume the first scenario could be very convincing.

as hellworldprincess said, there have to be youtubers who explain guns to complete beginners in a manner which is actually understandable.

i have literally no experience in buying/owning/doing anything with a gun outside of a gun range, so don't take my word for granted. i saw this post didn't have much reaction, so i thought i could put my, very cheap, 5 cents into that.

whatever you choose, i wish you luck with your decision. take care!",,,,,,,,,,,,

GULPS  w/pics,2643417,OverIt1976,"Aug 23, 2024 at 7:37 PM","Tonight is the night to CBT. I have finally received all of the components needed to construct the GULPS CO generator. You can find most of these in one place online. Here is what you will need:

Sulfuric Acid
Need at minimum 98% purity.
I found a supplier that sold 950ml for approximately $35.
Formic Acid
Need at minimum 85% purity.
I found a supplier that sold 950ml at 96% purity for about $35.
Large Glass Jar
The jar I found is 3.50 x 3.50 x 6.40 Inches (LWH)
Found one for about $3.
Small Glass Jar
Finding one was a huge problem as some were too wide, too tall and too small.
I did find one that fits perfectly... a normal shot glass.
I had one already, but found you can get a set of 6 for about $7.
Tubing
At first I found a 6mm 16 foot tube. It was waaaay to flimsy and had too many kinks for it to work.
I then found a sturdier plumbing tube. 6mm, 32 feet.
It even came with a tube cutter and some fittings.
I cut the tube and used about 24 inches.
5 liter container (washing chamber).
I used a Zerowater filter container.
Incidentals - what I used
Duct tape
Scissors
Sharp knife
Sharpie
Cardboard
Large carrying container to hold everything
Water
Screwdriver
Hammer
CPaP mask
CPaP hose
My method of getting everything put together.

Cut the tubing and use about 24 - 36 inches.
I used a screwdriver and hammer to puncture a hole in the lid of the large glass jar.
I Used the screwdriver to widen the hole for the fitting and tube.
I used the small fitting to secure the tube
I then used duct tape to secure the tube and fitting to the lid.
You don't need to do anything special with the small glass jar.
Thoroughly clean the Washing Chamber.
Grab some cardboard, and traced the lid with the Sharpie.
Used the shard knife to puncture where the holes are going to be.
Used scissors to cut the hole for the outgoing hose (CPaP hose).
Made a notch in the cardboard for the small incoming hose (see pics)
I taped the incoming tube to the inner part of the chamber, and then taped the end of the tube so it sits in the middle of the bottom ensuring the gas will have space to get to the water.
Use the duct tape to secure the outgoing hose (CPaP hose) to seal any gaps.
Use the duct tape to secure the lid to the container.
Leave about 1/5 un-taped to add the water later.
Attach the CPaP hose to the CPaP mask.
What you should have by now
Small glass jar inserted into the large glass jar
Tubing attached to the lid.
Do not have the tube inserted all the way. Just enough to capture the gas.
You don't want the acid to dissolve the tube
Cardboard lid cut and tubing attached and secured.
Lid mostly secured with duct tape.
Now when you're ready to CBT this is what you do
Fill the washing chamber half full of water. I used purified water
Secure the rest of the cardboard lid
Put the washing chamber into the carrying container
Take the small jar out of the large jar
USE CAUTION HERE.Yes, we are CBT'ing, but still be careful. These are very caustic chemicals.
Carefully add 250ml sulfuric acid to the large glass jar
Set aside and make sure it's not going to spill
Carefully add 50ml formic acid to the small glass jar
CAREFULLY place the small glass jar inside the large glass jar
DO NOT SPLASH or mix the chemicals.
Secure the lid to the large jar.
When you are ready to CBT then tip the large jar and ensure the two acids mix
This is what's going to produce the CO
When you start seeing bubbles in the washing chamber you can put the mask on.
CBT in about 2 minutes, if you did everything correctly.

1. Large/small jar with outgoing tube


2. Washing chamber with incoming tube


3. Cardboard lid with incoming/outgoing hose attached


4. Set up resting in carrying container",,,,,,,,,,,,

However I think it should be said that when you are truly in a suicidal state of mind critical thinking for even basic tasks is extremely difficult. You almost have to prepare all this before you ever enter a suicidal state And have it ready and waiting for you. Anyone who follows up with this method needs to be extremely careful and not underestimate how complicated something like this is to do when you're mentally distressed.

I failed two separate attempts trying to Suffocate myself with a neutral gas. It's quite pathetic of me I know Struggling to follow basic do-it-yourself craft instructions But when your brain starts shutting off your higher critical thinking functions then all you can truly see is suicide and you just want out, It's so difficult to pull off stuff like this.

It is possible to do normal everyday things while having these thoughts. You have no idea what I'm dealing with and what demons are screaming in my head. And quite frankly, I think your reply is a little offensive.

I'm sorry that your mental state and thought processes differ greatly from mine. I did extensive reserlach on several methods. I researched the acids i ourchased. Now, had i the money to biy a CO tester, i would. But ive spent everything i had on this. I did have my mentally distressed period. I'm confident in my choice for suicide.

I put this post together because I can't find anything that comes close to more specifics. I got the measurements from the 2022 PPH. I do plan on adding more acid to the mix, but I'm keeping this post as is, because some of it does mirror the PPH.

I was warning others that this is a complicated method of suicide And attention to detail is extremely important. You don't agree? You yourself said you're dealing with extremely dangerous chemicals?

Ending up with serious bodily injury or damage is a Possible outcome if you Overlook even the smallest thing. I've seen a fair share number of serious injuries from failed suicides working in the medical field And the chances that you fail and get injured go up the more Sophisticated any specific method is. You're talking about dealing with sulfuric acid Serious warnings need to be attached to this for anyone looking to follow in your footsteps.

I read over my post several times trying to find this offensive part that you claim exists but I just don't see it. Doesn't claim anything regarding Putting you into a box and knowing what sort of demons you're dealing with. The criticism in my post is stating anyone who follows up with this method Needs to be very calm collected and calculated with every action. Yes the majority of people that are suicidal struggle to put together sophisticated methods Desperation sets in and they simply just want out.

Your method cannot afford for someone to fail And they need to focus on every detail to get it right. You take this statement as some sort of jab against your competence and ego But it's not directed at you it's for other people on the site to take this method very seriously.

Is drowning under the influence of sedatives peaceful way to ctb?,2652888,kelp_301,"Aug 31, 2024 at 2:37 PM","Hi! I hope every1 here is doing okay. I know this might not be true, but I still hope for all of you. Anyways, I've been thinking of doing it for a long time. The first time I was having these thoughts was when I was 17 (I'm 21 rn btw). I prob had thousands of these thoughts and prob a hundred well detailed plans, but I never followed through any of them.

But this time is different. This time I really want to go through with it and be done with this miserable existance.

So I have a plan. I was thinking of doing it with drowning this time. Under the influence of Xanax. I have 30 (0.5 mg) xamax pills with me. My doc prescribed it 8 months ago for my Anxiety Disorder. It was a 2 months prescription, but I ended up buying and stockpiling a fair bit. Partially cus I was hooked on it, (It reduced my anxiety levels, especially when I was outdoors or when my anxiety was unbearable) and partially cus I knew this day would come. The dude at the counter didn't even question when I was buying like 4 months worth of these pills like bruh...

My Question is: Is drowning under the influence of Xanax a peaceful way to go? I'm not scared of the pain. Even if it's a lil bit painful, I would still go with it. But I don't want my last few moments in agony. I'm scared that if panic, I might not go through with it.

I've heard conflicting acounts of people saying if drowning is painful or not. I've heard from sumone that their experience of drowning was really peaceful. I won't go into details but if that's what drowning feels like then that's my choice. Xanax would help me feel less pain, cus I would be dipping in and out of consciousness. There's a man-made river/ canal ~100 km away from where I live. The canal is deep enough and fast enough to do the job (hopefully). I would do it in the middle of the night when most people would be eeping. I would spend sum time doing what I love, roaming around the countryside. Maybe spending sum time with nature. Then when night false, I will take 20 or so pills 20-25 minutes before doing it cus that's typically is when the effects takes place and I would hover over the bridge and jump off into the cold water below. Hopefully with the effects of xanax I would be less conscious and with cold river here in winter, my rate of surviving would be 0.

** Random vents, tl;dr: life miserable, pain pain pain, bad childhood, worst parents, no friends. **
Why am I doing this now? I just realized, no1 wants me in this world. So what's the point of it? I don't have any1 who cares bout me. My family hates me. They just like to control me, control where I'm going, control what I'm doing, controlling my future. I can't even go outside without asking for their permission. You know it's funny cus they were the reason I had such a shity childhood. My father is a narcissist peice of shit, who only cares bout himself, he would beat my mum, verbally abuses me. My mum is none better. I have no friends, the only friends that I had were from my high school. I have their contacts but you know how it is. We all have to move on. I'm not in high school anymore. I haven't seen them in a loooong time. I doubt they even remember me. I have a lot to say but I'm not here to vent. Just know that my life is miserable. And a few days ago, my mum (the only person I thought I had in this world) said face to face that I'm a burden to them

He was actually a good friend, but my mental turmoil and turbulence made it hard for me to feel like I could enjoy the moment when we would catch up and go to concerts and stuff. He deserved better, I hope he's well.

I attempted ctb beginning of June. I guess survival instinct kicked in and my body reacted against my attempt, but my mind never faltered in being certain it was what I wanted. Anyway, I voluntarily called 911 and went inpatient afterwards. When I left, I reconnected with a coworker from my previous job and pretty much said, ""hey, I'm very sorry to contact you out of the blue, but could I talk to you about some pretty intense stuff I just went through?"" Met up with them, talked and it was actually really good. They're a very supportive person that I've been keeping in touch with ever since and there is a friendship there.

But in terms of friends like people who I regularly see and hang out with outside of work whether in real life or online, no I don't have anyone like that.

I've actually been going to a local NAMI group once a month and there's some familiar faces I'm starting to see there. So I guess, there's supportive people that I'm finding in the aftermath of everything. I just started a new job this week and the workplace is surprisingly non-toxic lol.

Instead the laws are motivated by a genuine belief that suicide is tragic, often a response to temporary conditions (be they material or mental) that will dissipate with time, leading to avoidable premature death and bereavement.

Here's an example opium and morphine were popular and legal in the 1800s and Early 1900s . As we know morphine can be also used for a painless suicide.

The US Congress passed a law restricting morphine in 1914 to prescription only. In 1970 the monsters in the U.S. made barbiturates including nembutal controlled substances crimes to buy and possess

This explains things. Everything was legal until these bastards passed laws to make them illegal as they are about to pass law restricting Sn in the U.S. who made these monsters god ?
There are many horrible things that can happen to anyone. Homelessness is one of many intolerable horrible nightmares.. the technology for people escaping such nightmares is there for example, nembutal, suicide booths etc but the governments made all guaranteed painless suicide methods into crimes

They purposefully made nembutal , cyanide capsules, someone helping you to commit suicide, suicide booths and other guaranteed suicide methods into crimes.

They have almost completely eliminated Nembutal from the world.

In the evil U.S. they are about to ban SN as they did all the other methods

We all will die anyway. But because they banned the most peaceful dying Nembutal now people have to die painfully and suffer extreme pain for years before they die anyway

That these monsters made these crimes is the most insane evil thing.

There is only a few reasons why they did this , including to stop us from committing suicide and to control us.

So these monsters are evil torturers but they have everyone thinking they are smarter than us know what's better for us, that they want what's best for us : and that's bs otherwise why ban nembutal etc if we are all going to die anyway and are suffering? It's completely illogical and evil.

Sorry your suffering so much. I understand your desire to CTB, I don't think your selfish and respect your choice if that's what you decide to do. Ultimately most of us here will leave a loved one behind, be it parent, partner or child etc.

That said I hope you don't mind me using my own life experiences to give some reflection?

When my brother died as a kid my Mother was in similar position as you. She got very depressed and spent time in hospital for it. It took a long time for her to recover but if you asked her now she would be so thankful to be around, she has grandchildren now (from my sister) and she wouldn't miss that for the world. I'm sure your other children will give you so many happy memories in the future are you won't want to miss that.

Also I promise your kids wont be better of without you. Kids don't understand suicide properly, if their parent is suicidal it's likely they will look inwardly at themselves and wonder why you didn't want to be around them through life.

I know from your other thread that you blame yourself but again I think this happens to us all. I apericate it's very different but when my brother passed a week away before I had a thought of him dieing for no reason. To this day I still wonder if I having that thought somehow caused it, if he might of not died if I hadn't, I think it's what initially triggered my OCD. I'm sure if I asked you or 99percent of the world they would say I'm being ridiculous but that doesn't matter its a feeling that gets ingrained in you. Perhaps just try to put that in reflection; if you think my feelings of contributing to his death are silly maybe the same can be said for you? - Other people can see your not to blame but because of your grief you mind is playing tricks on you.

Again if you decide to go ahead I respect that, none of us should be critical of you. But I just wanted to give you some things to ponder, perhaps it's worth atleast try talking to someone who might be able to help with the grief?",,,,,,,,,,,,

Suicide Bereavement

As someone obviously suicidal, a son, believe me you did nothing wrong that any good parent woud have done in your shoes, there is no perfect parent; his illness took him to a better place, and he is and will be proud of you for keeping on for his siblings, and yourself. I can say that as I'm proud of you! Cry, scream, do whatever you have to do, in the days, weeks, months, years, this imperfect world is not your fault. You were the best person for him during his time here. I'm sorry it was cut short.",,,,,,,,,,,,

,2641048,Tesha,"Aug 21, 2024 at 5:54 PM","I'm so sorry for your loss and the grief you're feeling now. I'm a parent and to a limited degree can understand your self reflection. The fact is though, none of us are going to be able to answer your question. We never experienced the relationship you had with your son, your interactions or your parenting style.

He was still very young and in the midst of hormonal changes. My kids, of a similar age, say things to me all the time - they often acknowledge later on that they were just angry, tired or hungry. I often recall things they've said, but I know they don't think or feel them now. Try not to hold on that aspect of your son, as it will just be self defeating.

I think if you really reflect on your relationship you'll actually know the answer to your own question. You seem to have the ability to self reflect.

Do you have any other children or support in real life?",,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't see other reasons I think I provided the needs but not the emotional aspect. We argued about him keeps wearing his old shoes where he had 4 new Nike pairs in his closet and this type of arguments nothing big.

Your guilt around this doesn't mean you are correct, it's a very natural reaction to loss.

,2641107,Tesha,"Aug 21, 2024 at 6:46 PM","I'm going to be a bit of shit to you now - apologies up front. Firstly though, it doesn't sound like you were a bad parent. You might've got some priorities wrong, but you didn't necessarily push your Son away.

Your loss is still very, very fresh and painful. I can see by what you're writing, that you're still trying to process everything. It's going to take time. It's understandable that you'll be looking for reasons for his suicide and blaming yourself. I'm very much pro-choice, but I will say when I think someone needs to possibly step back and give themselves a bit more time.

Your other kid(s) have just lost their brother in traumatic circumstances. Losing their parent as well, in such a short time will destroy them. I understand you loved your Son - but I'm sure you also love your other kid(s). I feel you need to focus on your other children right now; they are the ones still alive and probably looking at you to help support them.

Please look at additional help for yourself irl. You can always come back to considering suicide at a later date - when everything has settled a bit and the raw emotions have subsided.",2641088,,,,,,,,,,,

They still have a chance at having a good life. Why not try and give it your all to give him/her/them a chance. Just don't be impulsive about it, this is a permanent thing, really really think it over, please.

Hindsight is 20/20. Even the best dads/moms/psychologists often don't see it coming. You are not a bad mom, you're just human. We don't notice or know everything, but.. we can learn. The ""I could've, should've"" es are really tempting to get lost in. I'm not the best with words and this all probably sounds a bit harsh (I don't mean to be). But try to see this as a learning experience and see the potential future of your other kid(s), they deserve to grow up with a mom who cares about them (which you clearly do!). We will never know what goes on in someone else's head, the best we can do is give them the best tools and advice to take on life, support them and hope they make it.

But then I momentarily wake up to the reality of the situation - that it doesn't really solve anything. Yes, it takes away all my crushing feelings of loss and grief over what could have been, but it also destroys everything else with it. Not only will the pain be gone, but also everything that I am. I won't be at peace, because there will be no me to experience peace. When I see it this way, it's terrifying.

Then I feel more trapped and desperate realising there's no answer, no way to truly solve my problems. And in this suffering I once again start to find comfort in the thought of death.

""The most important factor in suicide by jumping is height. Stone2 states that jumping from 150 feet (46 metres) or higher on land, and 250 feet (76 metres) or more on water, is 95% to 98% fatal. 150 feet/46 metres, equates to roughly 10 to 15 stories in a building, depending on the height of one story. 250 feet is the height of the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.""

If you land feet first you may survive.

,2661680,Grumble,"Sep 7, 2024 at 1:53 PM","This sounds absolutely awful, and I'm very sorry you're going through this.

One thing you can try when you feel yourself spiralling is repeating coping statements to yourself. Something like, ""I can survive this,"" ""I will be OK,"" ""I'll get through this."" Short statements like that combined with concentrated deep breaths. When I say ""repeating"", I mean repeating. Over and over and over and over and over. It's difficult to think two different thoughts at the exact same time. By repeating short coping statements, you're not only reinforcing to yourself that you're going to be OK, but you're preventing your brain from being able to think other thoughts, including the bad ones. The concentrated breathing is important as well because it's easy to fall into a trap of short-breathing which takes a toll on the body when it's already in a state of struggling. The goal is to relax your physical body as much as possible, even if it's in severe mental distress.

This isn't about making yourself feel ""better"". This is about surviving moment to moment. Not even surviving the next minute, but just surviving one moment at a time.

Then, if you're starting out at your lowest low... Even if you can lift yourself up ever so slightly, can you take advantage of that and transition yourself into a distraction. Anything. Do you have any pets you could spend time with? Can you spend some time with your mother or your father or your sister? Engage them in conversation? Doesn't have to be about your situation or about you at all. Being around other people (""if"" they're the supportive and caring type) and pets (if you have any) can act as a pick-me-up which you could try to use to get into a more time-consuming/involved distraction. If your family isn't an option and you don't have any pets, the other option I'd look at is what you're doing right now: Find someone online to one-on-one. You've survived the moment, and now what you're wanting to do is survive the day. No worries about tomorrow. Just getting through today.

Are you feeling ashamed about this?

You don't have to answer that, nor go into any details at all about it, and please know I ask that without a shred of judgement attached to it.

Nobody should be talking about you behind your back or circulating rumours. It's nobody's business to do that.

But I hope you know -- and I mean REALLY feel it -- that this is not your fault... that if anyone should be ashamed here, it's your ex. You have done NOTHING wrong.",2661493,,,,,,,,,,,

Any ingested dose of propranolol > 1 g is considered to be potentially lethal.

That said, there are multiple factors here. An adult man may weigh twice as much (if not more) than an adult woman, which has an impact. Someone may have a preexisting condition, making them more vulnerable to the effects of propranolol. It is possible to die by propranolol alone, there are documented cases of lethal overdoses. You should keep in mind though, that:
It takes time. @Tonkpils your CTB attempt might have been successful if your plan included not being found for several hours.
It's hard to estimate how much propranolol is enough. There are people who died after 5g, there are people who survived 8.
It's relatively easy to save your life if you get found. There are cases of people saved a couple of hours after ingestion.
Bottom line is: if you want quick and reliable, this isn't the right method. Otherwise keep in mind everything that can go wrong.

,2653703,birthdayboy,"Sep 1, 2024 at 9:09 AM","Almost everyone I know who's CTB has done so by hanging, and I think I'm just going to do that. I realize it's not the most painless method, but it seems like unconsciousness comes pretty quickly, and I've got a few pills in my drawer that should help with some of the pain and anxiety. Plus, knowing people who've done it makes it less scary to me.

I keep looking and considering all the recommended methods, and either they're not readily availably to me (like SN or firearms), or they're so complicated and confusing to set up (like charcoal). The thought of trying to do anything that complicated overwhelms me. I can barely function as it is due to my mental health problems.

With this, all I need is a sturdy rope that I can easily get from any hardware store, probably even Walmart or a dollar store, a ladder which I already have, and a sturdy branch on a hardwood tree like oak, which I have plenty in my neighborhood.

My plan is to wait for a cool enough day and then get bundled up completely in my snowboard gear because that should reduce the chance of someone being traumatized by finding me, since virtually no part of my skin will even be visible. I've got everything I need, just need to pick an appropriate date.
I'm talking about hanging, if that's not clear sorry. It's worked for everyone I know who's done it.

,2653806,locked*n*loaded,"Sep 1, 2024 at 11:11 AM","I think the ""traumatizing"" aspect would come more from the state of seeing someone hanging by their neck with a rope rather than by the state of dress. But, you need to do what you feel right for yourself, and if you feel that being clothed in the way you describe would lessen the impact to others, I think that's all that really matters.",2653703,,,,,,,,,,,
,2653814,birthdayboy,"Sep 1, 2024 at 11:17 AM","I mean, my nephew looked pretty ghastly when we took him down. Even though the sight of someone hanging would still be traumatic, even so I feel like things like the discoloration and facial expression are worse. Can't get that image out of your head.
Thank you so much. And I agree that never waking again would be ideal. I have a little bit of something on hand that might work for that very thing, but I can't get enough to do the trick, and I've never seen an attempted OD where the person didn't suffer miserably after. Hanging seems pretty reliable, in my experience.",2653806,2653776,,,,,,,,,,

17 year old dental nurse died after taking a single 1g tablet of sodium nitrite.

A man in his 30s who had exhibited mild depression was found dead in his house. At autopsy, the lividity of the face and back was greenish grey, and the blood was tinted a chocolate brown colour. Level of methemoglobin was 83.4% by spectrophotometry.

A case of methemoglobinemia caused by the accidental contamination of drinking-water with sodium nitrite. The patient had a MetHb concentration of 49%. The amount of sodium nitrite ingested was estimated to be 0.7g.

Two cases of fatal methemoglobinemia resulting from ingestion of laxative solution inadvertently contaminated with sodium nitrite are described. Postmortem toxicological examination revealed methemoglobin levels in excess of 75% in both patients – a level that is uniformly fatal. The laxative solution was found to contain sodium nitrite instead of sodium sulfate at a concentration of 15 g/L. The pathophysiology of methemoglobinemia and a review of other reported cases of toxic methemoglobinemia are presented. Marked cyanosis in the face of intact cardiorespiratory function should alert the physician to the possibility of toxic methemoglobinemia.

A 76-year-old man collapsed and rapidly developed brady-asystolic cardiac arrest 25 min following self-poisoning with an unknown quantity of crystalline sodium nitrite. On arrival in the ED the patient was asystolic with cardiopulmonary resuscitation in progress. Haemoglobin concentration was 110 g/L, arterial methaemoglobin measured 82.6% and serum lactate 9.6 mmol/L. Antioxidative treatment was undertaken with total 5 mg/kg intravenous methylene blue administered in divided aliquots. Despite prolonged resuscitative efforts the patient died.

SCIENTIFIC ARTICLES (UNSUCCESSFUL)

A 23-year-old female presented to the emergency department after intentionally ingesting an unspecified amount of sodium nitrate. She presented by ambulance to the hospital profoundly cyanotic and unresponsive. The patient's initial methemoglobin level was 92.7%.

A 52-year-old male was transported to hospital after being found at home by family, unconscious and slumped awkwardly for approximately 24 hours. After treatment reported chest pains, kidney injury due to SN, deep vein thrombosis, cognitive impairment (unclear if this was due to past history of ECT or SN).

Sodium nitrite ingestion for suicidal attempt, presented in unconsciousness, shock and deeply cyanosed condition. He was pulseless and had no recordable BP with methemoglobin level of 77%. He completely recovered after two days. Survival in a case of methemoglobinemia with extremely high level of methemoglobin, non-recordable BP and deep cyanosis is rarely reported.

Poisoning with sodium nitrite in three family members after eating homemade sausages given to them by their neighbour who was a butcher. The concentration of sodium nitrite in the homemade sausages was about 3.5g per 1kg of meat, almost 30 times higher than allowed according to legislation. A 70-year-old man died about 7 hours after consuming the meal, while two women, 53 and 67 years of age, respectively, were admitted to a toxicology clinic the following day due to food poisoning, with the maximum concentration of MHb in blood of 33.7 and 20.4%, respectively. They were discharged 3 days later. The autopsy of the deceased man showed sodium nitrite poisoning with a relatively low concentration of MHb in his blood – 9.87%. Death was attributed to the exacerbation of hypertensive and ischemic heart disease, resulting from accidental sodium nitrite poisoning.

11 men, aged 60 to 80, had been admitted to hospital with cyanosis and shock. In each instance illness occurred within 5 to 30 minutes after eating breakfast. They became dizzy, felt weak, and complained of abdominal cramps. Eight of them vomited and all had diarrhoea. Five of them became unconscious shortly after onset of symptoms. They had subnormal temperatures, cold extremities, and low blood pressures. In addition, all had cyanosis. All but one patient recovered. This man, age 82, died the following morning. Autopsy revealed bronchopneumonia. The only other abnormal finding was a diffuse mahogany brown discoloration of the organs.

A 28-year-old man was brought to our emergency department because of transient loss of consciousness and cyanosis. He was immediately intubated and ventilated with 100% oxygen. A blood test revealed a methemoglobin level of 92.5%. Outcome. We treated the patient with gastric lavage, activated charcoal, and methylene blue (2 mg/kg) administered intravenously. Soon after receiving methylene blue, his cyanosis resolved and the methemoglobin level began to decrease. After relocation to the intensive care unit, his consciousness improved and he could recall ingesting approximately 15 g sodium nitrite about 1 hour before he was brought to our hospital. The patient was discharged on day 7 without neurologic impairment.

A woman in her 20s was brought to the casualty clinic due to symptoms of psychosis, and it was deemed necessary to section her. While she was there, she drank two small bottles of reagents that she found in a Strep test kit. She then became somnolent and her oxygen saturation decreased. Guidance from the Poisons Information Centre was required for rapid clarification and correct treatment.

We present two patients who were treated for an intentional overdose of sodium nitrite. When ingested sodium nitrite leads to severe methaemoglobinaemia, resulting in severe hypoxia (as methaemoglobin does not transport oxygen), vasodilation and hypotension. Symptoms include cyanosis, headache, nausea, convulsions, coma and death. When measured by pulse oximetry, patients with a sodium nitrite intoxication and severe methaemoglobinaemia generally have an oxygen saturation of around 85%. This value is unreliable as the oxygen content of the blood is often extremely low - this can be confirmed by arterial blood gas analysis. Treatment of sodium nitrite intoxication consists of intravenous administration of methylthioninium chloride 1-2 mg/kg. Methylthioninium chloride converts the methaemoglobin back to haemoglobin.

A 20-year-old man presented to the ED after intentional ingestion of 750 mg of powdered sodium nitrite(98% by weight). He had been experiencing major depressive disorder for the last 6 months but had not taken medicine recently. He was under stress from a college issue and felt pressured to succeed in the future. He remained depressed for most of the day and repeatedly thought of death. He prepared a pill by filling an empty pill capsule with sodium nitrite powder and taking it with water at home. One hour later, the patient visited the ED. He stated that he obtained information on how to make the suicide pill from an online suicide forum and purchased sodium nitrite online. He brought a bottle containing 500 grams of 98% sodium nitrite by weight that he purchased online (Fig. 3). He experienced only mild nausea a few minutes after ingesting a self-produced suicide pill. A physical examination revealed no signs of central or peripheral cyanosis, and the patient was hemodynamically stable. The initial methemoglobin level was 4.8. His methemoglobin level returned to normal 2 hours after ingestion. Methemoglobin levels did not change following repeated measurements. The patient recovered without any problems with conservative supportive treatment.

This person used low purity sodium nitrite, A 23-year-old male with a medical history significant for previous suicide attempts, polysubstance use disorder in remission from alcohol and benzodiazepine use, nicotine dependence, current marijuana use, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and irritable bowel syndrome presented to the emergency department via emergency medical services (EMS) after intentional overdose. Patient reported ingesting 2 teaspoons of sodium nitrite he obtained from Walmart.com 6 hours before presentation in an attempt to end his life.The patient reported losing consciousness after ingestion and waking up in his own vomit and feces. He felt confused and called EMS. In the emergency department (ED), the patient acknowledged nausea, vomiting, and bowel incontinence. He complained of severe diffuse abdominal pain that was 8/10 in severity. He had used marijuana that day. He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, coingestion with other prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, street drugs, and ethanol. He had no auditory hallucinations, current suicidal ideation, or current homicidal ideation. Patient was released with no damage.

Add this study to your extensive post and we have enough evidence to assume that SN is a very reliable and relatively peaceful method compared to other options. The chance for permanent damage in case of survival is extremely slim. All people mentioned here seem to have recovered just fine from their failed attempt. And I think the information we have gathered is irrefutable evidence that SN is not(!) a horrible method as the media and opponents of this forum suggest.,,,,,,,,,,,,

Scientific articles (successful SN)

An 18 year-old male found deceased on his bedroom floor with a 550g bottle of sodium nitrite nearby. His medical history included anxiety, depression, bipolar and previous overdose; he was prescribed olanzapine. Plain and preserved blood (sub-clavian) and plain and preserved urine samples were provided for toxicological analysis. Ethanol was not detected in blood or urine however; olanzapine was detected on screening, which was confirmed to be present at a therapeutic concentration (0.21 mg/L). The post-mortem preserved blood (sub-clavian) nitrite level was 3.33 μmol/L whilst the nitrate concentration was 10,319 μmol/L.

A 48 year-old female discovered at a lake after a call was made to emergency services from the deceased stating that she had consumed sodium nitrite. Upon admission her methaemoglobin saturation was reported to be >70%; shortly after arriving in hospital she suffered a cardiac arrest and died. Her past medical history includes multiple attempts at suicide by overdose, self-harm and anxiety. Mirtazapine, diazepam, zopiclone and venlafaxine were prescribed to the deceased. Ante-mortem blood samples and post-mortem plain and preserved blood and preserved urine were provided for toxicological investigation. A low concentration of ethanol was detected in ante-mortem blood (28 mg/dL) and post- mortem screening revealed the presence of therapeutic levels of venlafaxine (209 ng/mL), diazepam (77 ng/mL) and cyclizine (261 ng/mL). The post-mortem blood zopiclone concentration was elevated at 144 ng/mL, which may have resulted in a degree of somnolence. The presence of atropine is consistent with medical intervention. Post-mortem plain blood nitrite and nitrate levels were 4912 μmol/L and 527 μmol/L respectively.

A 41 year-old male discovered deceased in bed; a suicide note and two glasses marked poison with a syringe were also found. The deceased had a medical history of back pain, asthma and low mood. Metoclopramide and sertraline were prescribed. Plain femoral blood and plain urine were provided for analysis. Ethanol was detected in the plain blood sample (59 mg/dL) but was not present in the plain urine sample which may be indicative of post- mortem ethanol production. Several drugs and their metabolites were detected on the toxicological screening performed including metoclopramide, propranolol (175 ng/mL), paracetamol (19.3 mg/L), codeine (<5 ng/mL), sertraline (232 ng/mL) and cimetidine. There was also evidence of prior cannabis and cocaine use. The post-mortem femoral plain blood nitrite level was 22.0 μmol/L whilst the blood nitrate level was 16,160 μmol/L.

A 32 year-old male found having consumed sodium nitrite; emergency services attended and commenced CPR but despite best efforts he died. He had a past medical history of depression and drug overdose and was not known to be prescribed any medication; however, vials of testosterone and finasteride tablets were in his room. Plain and preserved femoral blood and preserved vitreous samples were received for analysis. There is evidence of ethanol consumption prior to death (preserved blood ethanol 232 mg/dL and preserved vitreous 204 mg/dL). Cetirizine, finasteride, and anastrozole were detected on screening; the latter two of these are associated with anabolic steroid misuse. The post-mortem femoral plain blood nitrite level was 15.1 μmol/L whilst the blood nitrate level was 13,540 μmol/L.

A 29 year-old male who, according to the case history provided by HM Coroner, reportedly used a 'suicide kit' containing sodium nitrite prior to his death. At post-mortem he was noted to appear dusky grey in colour which is likely to be a result of an associated methaemoglobinaemia; although analysis was not performed. A past medical history and drugs prescribed were not provided in the case report. Plain and preserved blood and urine were provided for toxicological analysis. The post-mortem plain blood nitrite and nitrate concentrations were 172.6 μmol/L and 1860 μmol/L respectively. Apart from the presence of fexofenadine (a non-sedating anti-histamine) no other drugs were present.

A 27-year-old male found slumped on the sofa with a second individual (case 17); both noted to be blue-grey in appearance and believed to have made a suicide pact. A note was present at the scene and a list of various medications was found on a table. Apart from low mood, the deceased had no significant past medial history. Plain and preserved femoral blood and urine and preserved vitreous were provided for analysis. Screening revealed the presence of domperidone which is an anti-emetic drug, ibuprofen and paracetamol. Paracetamol was detected at a concentration suggestive of therapeutic use. There was no evidence of ethanol or illicit drug use. The nitrite and nitrate levels in post-mortem plain blood were 2889 μmol/L and 1035 μmol/L respectively.

A 38 year-old male with a history of persistent delusional disorder, alcohol misuse and previous suicide attempts who was prescribed fluoxetine and aripiprazole. He had recently been discharged from hospital and was found deceased on the sofa. He is believed to have formed a suicide pact with another male (case 16). Plain and preserved femoral blood and urine and preserved vitreous were provided for analysis. Again, screening revealed the presence of domperidone, ibuprofen and paracetamol. Ethanol was also detected in post- mortem blood (86 mg/100mL), urine and vitreous indicating consumption prior to death. There was also evidence of concomitant cocaine use prior to death; benzoylecgonine was detected at a concentration of 409 ng/mL. The post-mortem plain blood nitrite and nitrate concentrations were 1336 μmol/L and 2778 μmol/L respectively.

A 14 year old male discovered with a tub of powder labelled sodium nitrate; white powder residue was found in the bedroom of the deceased. Plain blood and vitreous samples were provided for analysis. A therapeutic concentration of paracetamol alone was detected from screening performed. The post-mortem plain blood nitrite and nitrate concentrations were 21 μmol/L and 14,043 μmol/L respectively.

A 29 year old female who had a history of drug overdose; sodium nitrite was retrieved from the scene. The following drugs were prescribed / available; mirtazapine, propranolol, morphine, codeine and paracetamol. Plain and preserved femoral blood samples were received for toxicological screening. Sub-therapeutic concentrations of paracetamol, codeine and propranolol were detected along with a likely therapeutic concentration of mirtazapine (235 ng/mL). The post-mortem preserved blood nitrite concentration was 2.3 μmol/L, whilst the post-mortem preserved blood nitrate concentration was 3730 μmol/L.

A 47 year-old male who, given the dusky/ashen appearance of his skin on post-mortem was believed to have ingested nitrite/nitrate prior to death. Plain and preserved blood samples were provided for analysis. A therapeutic concentration of paracetamol was detected. Olanzapine and its metabolite were detected but not quantitated. The post-mortem unpreserved blood nitrite and nitrate concentrations were 15 μmol/L and 3537 μmol/L respectively.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Lukas19:
Just under 2 hours to go. Departure at Midday.
AE + SN (some Paracetamol and Xanax)
taken paracetamol, xanax, AE. Now am waiting 40 mins.
permanent peace, reincarnation or understanding god
20 mins is an eternity
taken my SN, UNPLEASANT
GOODBYE!

Mimi_:
I am following Stan's guide using Metopimazine as AE. I know it is not the best but I have backup glasses so I am not concerned about throwing up. I still have 5 hours to reach the fast of 8h, so I'm going to fondle Lizzie and listen to music during this time. I never felt so lonely tho.

The SN is from IC, it arrived in one week.
I will take 25g of SN per glass, I weigh around 66kg for 1m73 so it should be enough. Is it true that drinking warm water is preferable for absorption? I know laying on the right side is, so I will do so. If you have any advice, please let me know !!
I'll try to write down how I feel throughout the process until I pass out.

Torch:
I'll take 28g SN in 65ml water around midnight. Been fasting food & liquid since last night, got low blood sugar and did have to have a few apple slices around noon est, hope that's okay.

6 hours before: 500mg Tylenol, 10mg meto done 4:00pm
4 hours before: 600mg Ibuprofen, 10mg meto
2 hours before: 500mg Tylenol, 10mg meto
1 hour before: 40mg famotidine, 75mg Benadryl, 10mg meto, 0.5mg xanax
30 minutes before: 800mg Ibuprofen, 500mg Tylenol, 75mg Benadryl, 3tbs Pepto Bismol, 500mg Cephalexin, 0.5mg xanax, 30mg meto, 16mg zofran.
0 minutes before: 25mg Benadryl, 2tbs Pepto Bismol, 0.5mg xanax, 28g Sodium Nitrite in 50ml of water

Arcadia:
Just ate my last meal, starting my 8 hour fast. I don't know if I'll pussy out or if something will come up but I think this is it. I just hope I have the strength to go through with it, my AE is Prochlorperazine and I'll be taking Omeprazole as an Antacid too. I'm a bit on edge right now because my family are awake, but I'll be doing it when they're asleep so hopefully my nerves will settle down by then. I appreciate this community for providing the resources towards helping me attain a peaceful and quick death, and it being here for me to vent judgement free. People might infer that this forum kills people but it honestly helped me, I would've been gone a lot sooner and in a much more painful way if I didn't have this place where I could share my frustrations with life without being ostracised or being sectioned. Without knowing about these resources I still would've died, just from throwing myself off a bridge or stabbing myself in the chest. My heart is racing just typing this. Please wish me luck.

Unsuccessful attempts

Skylarwhiteyo104781:
It took me a while, maybe 10 minutes to get myself to drink the SN. It was pretty much exactly like swallowing heavily salted water. Super unpleasant and I had to follow it up with more water. I wasn't able to get the entire mixture down even if I plugged my nose.

I drank about a little over half of it and sadly even with the Zofran ended up throwing it up. I had another mixture ready but I physically couldn't bring myself to drink it and physically repulsed as I tried to bring the cup to my lips. I don't remember what happened after but I woke up just now (1:57 PM EST) and feel pretty groggy but that's it. No other side effects not even a headache.

I'm pretty disappointed I wasn't able to bring myself to drink the SN the second time because I have a lot of things in my life happening in the next few weeks that I'm not looking forward to. I'm not sure if I should try to attempt to CTB tonight with the second SN mixture I created last night that's been sitting out on my bedside table. I don't have any more Zofran tho but I have some over the counter nausea medication- although I understand why those aren't supposed to work.

Willitpass:
After taking sn, nausea, sweating, puke, stomach pain and sweating was better but body is tingling and look blue. Hot and sweaty again told my boyfriend to call for help, I don't know will he be here on time. My body tingles and fingers are blue, feeling extremely lightheaded, telling my boyfriend that I am dying, CPR was given, I was given methalyn blue and was up and walking within 12 hours at the hospital.",,,,,,,,,,,,

LetzteAusfahrt:

before taking sn:
Today the time has finally come, I have my final exam. I will finally find out whether I have learned the right thing and can actually apply it.

At least the part about being relaxed seems to fit, I'm completely relaxed and hardly think about tonight. Let's see how it develops.

I am pursuing two goals with the ctb today. Primarily, of course, that I can finally end my existence and find my place in the common, infinite ""nothing"". The nothing that relieves me of all agony and pain, frees me from it.

I'm looking forward to it so much. To the moment when I realize that the light is about to go out and that I will be on the last path.

For the first time in my life, I got to know the feeling of community here in the forum. A community that accepts everyone for who they are. In which everyone helps one another to find the difficult goal of peace.

For this I would like to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart, first and foremost of course the operators and moderators of the forum.

As a small thank you to dss forum, my ctb is documented by an online observer who writes for me, even if I can no longer do it myself, e.g. because I see everything blurry.

My SN regime is very simple

02:00 pm fasting starts (eating)
08:00 pm 600mg ibuprofen
08:00 pm fasting starts (drinking)
10:00 pm 25g SN in 50ml water

I have prepared 4 servings of 25g SN in 50ml water. Better safe than sorry.

And in the unlikely event that I do wake up again, I wear a noose for a tourniquet around my neck, 3 wooden sticks are ready next to me. Better safe than sorry.

I still have a few things to do and I won't have much time to write. Otherwise, there is already little time to have everything done on my appointment.

I thank everyone from the bottom of my heart who will write to me and I also wish you a pleasant and peaceful journey if you will follow my path.

Goodbye my friends, may you also find the peace you long for.

Before taking sn:
Dear SS community,

Unfortunately it's time for my bus. I've completed all my preparations and I'm finally ready to ctb today.

It's been a pleasant stay for me here. I've enjoyed reading and partaking in the discussions. Thank you for being a good community and place where discussing suicide isn't taboo.

For those curious as to why: It's a complicated bag of existential and personal problems. My desire to live has been non-existent for way too long. And I refuse to live for the sake of others. Furthermore I've already been through the mental healthcare system and take medications. But even that can only do so much by itself.

My method of choice is SN and I'll probably just take some ibuprofen beforehand. I'll tolerate whatever discomfort comes though I'm hoping it will knock me out before that. I've chosen to do this at a nearby forest to avoid leaving a mess for the public eye.

Anyways, good bye

After taking sn:

If someone could please post my next few updates in my good bye thread, I'm about to drink the SN, I'm not sure how long I will have consciousness

Jellyfish42: Sipping, it's really salty

Jellyfish42(2 minutes after beginning ingestion): Nothing so far just salty, a slight burn on the back of the throat but not painful at all. Can feel heart starting to pound a little bit

Jellyfish42(5 minutes after): Heart pounding faster, no pain or discomfort so far

Jellyfish42(7 minutes after): Finished first glass of SN, nothing but a really salty after taste and heart beating faster

Jellyfish42(8 minutes after): Yup I want to go for the second glass but damn it's so salty it's off putting. I'm getting slight urge to vomit also

Jellyfish42(11 minutes): Chewing a little bit of gum to help with the digestion, no pain or discomfort so far. Body feels weak though and heart still pounding. Stomach feels a little weird.

Jellyfish42(14 minutes): Vomited no pain or discomfort heart is beating

Jellyfish42(17 minutes): Attempting 2nd glass. Slight twitches in my legs, legs starting to sleep, not painful

Jellyfish42(21 minutes): 2nd glass downed, feeling weaker, heart pounding, no pain or discomfort really just a bad after taste

,2026668,slapppy,"Jun 3, 2023 at 4:41 PM","It is clear that some reported no pain at all and others experienced severe stomach pain.

Here is my explanation

Gastric acid (HCL) reacts with SN (NaNO2) to form Salt (NaCl)

According to the reaction:

NaNO2 + HCL -> HNO2 + NaCl

If you do not take an antacid to reduce the HCL in your stomach, not only will some SN be converted away before it can reach your bloodstream,

you will also have a large amount of salt in your stomach, which is understandably painful

SO IT IS IMPORTANT TO TAKE AN ANTACID

IGNORING THE ANTACID CAN LEAD TO SEVERE STOMACH PAIN

You can be successful without it, but there are plenty of cases of people who ctb with an antacid to show us it is not harmful.

Even Stan took an OTC antacid.

And he gave the same explanation here


For those of you who will say antacids are no longer recommended in the PPH

Here is what Stan had to say about the author of PPH (basically the author Nitschke is not reliable when it comes to details)

Antiacid should not be added in the sn procedure because it will reduce stomach acid which will make the sn absorption too long, you already taking meto to stop nausea and vomiting adding too much medicine will make the sn procedure worse because high chances of vomiting which you don't want in sn method as the ultimate rule is to keep the sn in your system

Anyone reading this, don't use antiacid!

,2026712,slapppy,"Jun 3, 2023 at 5:10 PM","Backup your claims with chemistry then. I did.

You have been telling everybody to skip the antacid when there are many cases where people were successful with one.

You put full trust in PPH when they recommended 2 grams of propranolol in the past and now they say its not necessary.

They are not a reliable source for exact details.

Fallacy: Appeal to authority.

What is the appeal to authority fallacy? The appeal to authority fallacy is a type of informal fallacy that occurs when someone uses the authority, reputation, or expertise of a person or a source as the sole or primary reason to support their argument, without providing any other evidence or reasoning.

I only trust Stan because he explained the chemical reason behind using an antacid. Not because he was seen as an authority on the method.",2026694,,,,,,,,,,,
,2026741,Vizzy,"Jun 3, 2023 at 5:32 PM","I gave you the science behind that antiacid will reduce the stomach acid production that makes sn absorption longer which will make the death time longer, I don't know what more explanation you need

Yes I have been telling everyone to skip antiacid because I follow ppeh as they are more reputable and they know what they are talking about

Yes I put my full trust on ppeh, as time goes all the procedures change so ppeh making changes is not a big deal because we all learn from previous mistakes and research

Ppeh is the most reliable one when it comes to euthanasia, if they are not reliable they won't survive this long and no one will be reading their book

,2661534,zengiraffe,"Sep 7, 2024 at 11:26 AM","Around 2 years ago I attempted to kill myself using the inert gas asphyxiation method and failed. Here's a report of what I did and where I think I made mistakes that ultimately caused me to fail.

I bought an 80cf (cubic feet) compressed argon gas cylinder from a gas supply store. I've never been inside a gas supply store before and was very nervous I would say or do something that the staff would find suspicious, but my fears were totally unwarranted, everything went swimmingly and I was out of the store with my cylinder in under 10 minutes.

I also bought an oxygen meter from Amazon. The oxygen content in air is 20.9%, and when I turned the meter on that's the reading it would show. I tested the meter by breathing on it (our breath is largely carbon dioxide) and the reading went down to ~10%, so I was satisfied that it worked. I then tested the gas in the cylinder by putting the oxygen meter in a small container and then filled that container with gas from the cylinder and I saw the meter go down to ~5%, so I was satisfied that the gas in the cylinder was likely pure argon.

Now I know almost everyone says to use an exit bag, but I was really concerned that the exit bag would slip off of my head during the attempt, or that the flow of gas into the bag will pop it after I lose consciousness but before I die and I would survive the attempt but not without getting severe brain damage. I really wanted to avoid these possibilities, so I decided against using an exit bag and chose to use an exit room instead. This room was actually a shoe closet, and after measuring the inner dimensions I determined there was ~60cf of space inside this closet. I would take this closet and turn it into my own homemade Sarco pod, basically.

I cleared everything out from the closet, put myself, the oxygen meter, the argon gas cylinder, a couple flashlights, and a bunch of tape inside. Once inside I used the flashlights to see and the tape to cover anything that would allow air to flow in or out of the closet. I taped it up from the inside and made it as air-tight as possible, with the exception of one small vent hole near the top of the closest. I felt the vent hole was necessary so that the pressure in the closest wouldn't increase as I filled it with argon gas, otherwise the increased pressure might crack the door and cause air to leak in. The reason I put it near the top of the closest is because pure argon is slightly heavier than regular air, so it will fill up the closet from bottom to top, so any gas that escapes from the top vent hole would likely be regular air and not argon.

Once that was done I sat down on the floor of the closet and turned the gas regulator on the cylinder to flow rate of about 10cfh (cubic feet per hour). This would expend all of the gas in the cylinder in about 8 hours, and will completely fill up the closet in 6 hours, although since I was at the very bottom of the closet I assumed the oxygen content where my head as at would decrease enough within an hour for me to lose consciousness, and that I would likely be brain dead within 1.5 - 2 hours. Just to make sure that everything was working as expected I also turned on the oxygen meter and left it on the floor next to me, checking the reading on the meter periodically. After about 30 minutes the oxygen percent at the floor level was only about 8%, and at my head level it was about 16%. After 1 hour the oxygen percent at the floor level was only about 3%, and at my head level it was about 11%. I started freaking out at this point. The reason I was freaking out is because if the readings on the meter were accurate I definitely should have lost consciousness already yet I was totally alert. I started thinking maybe the meter is broken, or maybe the gas in the cylinder isn't as pure as I thought, or maybe the closet isn't air tight and air is still sneaking in from somewhere. I thought if I stayed there any longer I might not kill myself but just give myself permanent brain damage. I panicked and busted the door open, which took almost 5 minutes because of how heavily I taped it up from the inside.

Anyway, here's what I learned:

1) The longer the method takes, the more time it gives your SI to kick in. Any method that takes longer than 30 minutes is way too long. Even 10 minutes is too long. If I could have done things differently I would have set the gas flow rate to 60cfh instead of 10cfh, so that the room would fill up in 1 hour instead of 6, and the oxygen percent at my head level would drop below ~10% in around 10-15 minutes.

2) People online say that 15% oxygen in the air is already low enough to cause loss of consciousness. That's bullshit. I could have played a game of chess at 11% oxygen. It makes sense that the body can easily survive with that amount, because there are people who due to unfortunate circumstances need to have one of their lungs surgically removed and then they live out the rest of their lives just fine with only one lung remaining. A person with one lung who breathes at the same rate as a person with two lungs would process half of the amount of air volume over the same period of time, so a one lung individual is effectively breathing at 10.45% oxygen all the time. That an oxygen level of 10% is dangerous is propaganda made up by Big Oxygen. Do not believe the lies! If you are serious about killing yourself using inert gas asphyxiation you absolutely need to put yourself in an environment where the oxygen content is 5% or lower. Again if I could have done things differently I should have increased the gas flow rate to drop the oxygen percent in the closet faster.

3) I have mixed feelings about using the exit room. Maybe I bit off more than I could chew trying to fill up an entire closet with argon gas. The exit bag would have been way faster and more efficient for sure, but I just can't shake the concern that something with the bag will fail and that will cause the entire attempt to fail, possibly with irreversible brain damage.

4) Just buy a shotgun. This is America. Why waste time with elaborate methods like inert gas asphyxiation that require a ton of research, planning, and coordination to get right when $200 and a 10 minute drive to your nearest gun store will get you a piece of equipment that is significantly more lethal, more reliable, faster, and easier to kill yourself with? Shotguns are the way! After getting a shotgun and shooting it at a gun range I know I have something I can use to take myself out at any time, and with virtually 100% certainty. All other methods just seem like suicide roleplay to me now. I do feel bad for people in other countries with no gun rights that have to resort to these methods though, I know it's not roleplay for them.

Well anyway, I hope this post helps someone in some way. Thanks for reading.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes you're right. Close to where I live there are caves though. I could try getting into one and dissapearing. There are no cameras here so the likelihood of them tracking me is low but not zero.

Even then, your living in a glass castle at that point and a SINGLE thing going wrong will shatter your reality quicker than you'll realize and then you join the club to which there is no return to normalcy because at that point you have found out that there is no safety net to catch you and you can keep falling further and further down until you will wish you had ended everything but by that point it's too late and your existence is resigned to either the cold streets or a cell and the only thing keeping you warm at night is either your memories that are akin to an opiate buzz that is fleeting or a ratty blanket.

I do understand the reality that working long hours long-term may not be sustainable for many of us due to mental illness, which causes chronic fatigue, mood swings, and insomnia. You don't need to do everything by yourself. Marrying someone who earns a high income and provides is an easy way to balance this. It's even better if that person is a high-functioning, moderately social ""schizoid,"" because they aren't energy vampires and don't let their emotions rule.

While I was looking for more information, on YouTube I found an interview with a mother whose son committed suicide using inert gas. And already looking for information on inert gases I came to this site and learned about SN, which is now my method. I was supposed to CTB at the end of summer, but due to my depression I ordered SN too late. Initially I ordered 2 times from one site (something like AMAZON), but the results of the test said that the purity of SN was insufficient. Now I ordered from the chemical store with good reviews + I had to order new test strips.

I just received a message that my SN has been transferred to the transport company (exact date of arrival is not yet known, but it will take about a week). The package with test strips and distilled water I can pick up on September 11th.

if everything goes well, by the end of next week I will get the SN and check it (pray with me so that this time the purity would be sufficient)

The main problem is the place. I live with my parents and sister. We live not in a private house, but in apartment (i.e. here is quite good audibility and I'm just afraid to wake someone up if I vomit). I spent my savings to order several times SN, AE and other stuff (water, scales, pipette, etc). So now I don't have enough money to rent a hotel room, but I think by the end of September I will be able to save enough.

I don't know what this post should be. It's just another proof that I can't do anything right. If I had just started to care about it earlier, I wouldn't have to suffer now at university. I need to keep up my grades, I can't just skip all classes, otherwise someone from the study department will just text my parents :/

30yrs of failed attempts,2650659,lifeisactualtorture,"Aug 29, 2024 at 8:13 PM","I had no idea how hard it would be to ctb! My only regret in life is failing at my first attempt technically over 30 years ago. Life has just gotten so incredibly intolerable. It has been one trauma followed by another for decades ending in now physical pain for over 5 years and the destruction of my life and who I was. I am beyond done and each day I stay things get worse and I am just becoming a monster from all the abuse I am forced to endure. I will find a way trust me! Explaining how bad things are would take too much time and there's no one in this much pain both physical and mental. I'm beyond desperate to get the hell off this dumpster fire of a planet with all its ' horrifying abusers. Every single person in my life betrayed me or hurt me or abused me or fill in whatever horrific word you can handle and I promise I lived it. I didn't survive, I failed to die. I hardly exist and anyone that would want me to stay is cruel. I am honest with the few people left in my life and they actually agree with me because my situation is impossible to escape especially since one of my current cages is my own body. I'll end with a possibly stupid question(s) but can I use sodium nitrate? If not, can I convert it into nitrite? Also, what is an anchor point and why? Lastly what am I looking for precisely outside (something that could hold my weight is a little vague)??",,,,,,,,,,,,

I am much younger than you, also enduring the same repetitive cycle of pain (even if not as bad as yours) while carrying the burden of a failed partial hanging attempt.
Everyone has their reasons and motives and i can't think of myself waiting no more than 5 years to CTB or even to help a relative/friend in your situation.


Yes, you can use SN. There are alot of threads and research on the SN with water method, but if i can guarantee you one thing is that no amount of SN is a confirmed kill, so be careful, but don't try to overdose, otherwise the pain-killers and sedatives included in most method will be of no use.
Here's a little chart i found to give you some perspective, as i can't accurately guess your weight:


Idk if you are referring to a specific term called ''anchor point'' as i'm a bit new on this topic, even if i attempted it earlier, so i'll try not to say much about it.
Now for the second question; medium sized trees, ceiling joists/beams, wall studs, metal railings, exposed pipes or even wall hooks designed for hanging plants, hammocks, etc might do the job",2650659,2650659,2650659,,,,,,,,,

I find it kind of weird though when people seem to view the lack of money as a weaker reason to CTB. It's not like something you can just get! People who lack money presumably don't have wealthy families who can support them. They maybe can't get a well paid job or, don't want to work all the hours required to get that kind of money.

Not having money makes life a million times worse

Even a lot of money can't prevent horrible things like cancer , stroke , accidents , old age , extreme pain etc

Non-existence forever is the ultimate bliss

Non-existence is better than living

Mainlander agrees with me

""life in the best state of our time is worthless. Life in general is a ""miserably miserable thing"": it has always been miserable and miserable and will always be miserable and miserable, and Non-being is better than being""

I always had suicidal ideation at the back of my head when I was poor due to having an abusive family, being bullied but I was very optimistic growing up so I brushed those thoughts off and did my own thing. I always believed I was destined to be wealthy. I found out about bitcoin very early, through using the darkweb and working in the ""underworld"" (sex-work). I invested all my extra student loan money, waited then hit it big. For a while, I was very happy when I hit 7 figures on my portfolio, moved to a beach house in Mauritius, i had grown up in UK.

Looking back I realise the happiness was pure mania, bordering psychosis. Hedonic adaptation sets in and you go back to baseline level of happiness, or even way lower in my case (pits of hell hopelessness). I saw the real true nature of my so-called family and friends, most people only pretend to care if they know they can get something from you. I have a deep mistrust of most people. I overindulged, my anhedonia got worse.

An apology to my beloved cat.,2646080,Cyber4ngel!,"Aug 26, 2024 at 8:27 AM","My most sincere apologies to my beautiful kitty, my ray of sunshine, the living being that loves me the most and the only one that truly does so without ulterior motives.

I'm sorry for the times you had to listen to me cry all night.

I'm sorry for all the panic attacks you saw me have and for the times I pushed you away and shouted at you to leave me alone when you just wanted to comfort me.

I'm sorry for waking you up from your nap to hug you and seek comfort.

I'm so sorry for making you witness your mom covered in blood and hurting herself; I'm sorry for getting angry when you tried to take the blade from my hands with your little paw.

I'm sorry for making you hear me scream that I want to die.

I'm sorry for taking so long to figure out who to leave you with when I'm no longer in this world, even knowing that there is no one in this world you could love more than me, knowing that you distrust and fear any face that isn't mine.

I'm sorry for taking longer than I should to refill your food and water bowl; I don't want you to go hungry, but sometimes I can't move from the bed.

I'm sorry for going weeks without cleaning your litter box; we both hate the smell, I know. I'm sorry for getting angry when you go outside the box, knowing it's my fault for not cleaning it more often; I just don't have the energy.

I'm sorry for not having a clean room for you; I'm sorry you have to live in a dirty place that smells like cigarette smoke, Im sorry that you have to walk on my clothes scattered on the floor.

I'm sorry for not playing with you more often; I love watching you play and would love to spend more time together; but you have too much energy.

I'm sorry for not letting you socialize more with other cats; I would love to see you get along with them.

I'm sorry for not cooking you homemade food like I said I would; I don't have money even to feed myself.

I'm sorry for not being the best mom for you; I want you to know that you will always be the sweetest kitty in the world to me; you never did anything wrong, you don't deserve all this.

I'd love to have some assistance. Not someone to do it ""with me"" but help me with the ideas. I don't wish this on anyone. So if you want to do it to don't contact me because my compassion will be activated and I don't want that right now. I just want to get out of here with as little emotions as possible crushing me with its weight any more than I have to deal with every day as it is.


What I've tried myself already:
I've already tried ""Cutting"" (unsuccessful). 450k mg of tylenol pm and nyquil (unsuccessful). Five tanks of helium (unsuccessful). I don't have a bath tub. Don't want any pills. Don't want hanging that can be super unsuccessful and just painful. Don't own a gun. Don't have any tall enough buildings near by that I feel I won't survive the jump from. I don't have any like scientific chemicals at my disposal. So if you come with the idea of let's say one. Please note that I'm in San Diego and I need to be also given the information of where to go physically get it. (If it has to be ordered I don't want it).
Please be thorough and supportive. Thank you.


Ive spent the last (over) two years (on and off). Attempting to NOT CTB. I am at my wits end now.

I can not hold on any more. There is no fixing anything. If there was in the last two years it would have been done. This life has been unintentionally squandered. Debt of every kind is too great to pay back.

A great deal of people here wish for nothingness after death, but not all of us do.

Materialism is popular for a reason and provides a good foundation for observing things in the physical world. The brain as the creator of consciousness is the popular approach today, but the hard problem of consciousness still remains.

I studied engineering. I still don't disbelieve the continuation of consciousness. At the very minimum, the building blocks of matter must be conscious in some small part if their arrangement creates consciousness. At the higher end of belief, the brain may be thought of as a receiver of the living universe.

A healthy amount of skepticism is good to have, but the truth for everyone is that they do not know the truth. Belief that the brain creates consciousness is intuitive, intelligent, common sense. Belief in a soul or continued consciousness also has many of these elements.

If it's any consolation, I don't believe a troubled mind is still troubled after death regardless of the circumstances.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Plants? Fungi? Amoebae? Archaea? Bacteria? What about a bubble of lipid with proteins inside it?

Life evolved from chemistry, and is chemistry. Chemicals don't have souls. Your consciousness is the result of complex biological phenomena, and when those phenomena stop, so does your consciousness.

Not convinced? Well, in my previous post I mentioned memories, thoughts, consciousness and personalities.

1) Memories. This is the easiest one. We've all forgotten things, for one. We've all met people with dementia who have serious, permanent memory issues which can be traced back to a neurological cause. We also know that brain injury can cause amnesia, especially injuries to the temporal lobe.

2) Thoughts. Our thoughts are contained within our brain and are the product of evolutionary processes. That's why we have so many irrational thoughts, and why our thoughts can be affected by both disease (whether that's depression, or dementia again, or any other mental illness you care to name) and by medication. Again, our thoughts can be affected by brain damage. Look up Pick's disease, or reduplicative paramnesia, for instance.

3) Consciousness. We can differentiate between a number of disorders of consciousness: brain death, persistent vegetative state, coma, and most crucially, locked-in syndrome. In the last of those, despite the patient appearing to be dead due to their inability to move, they retain consciousness, which can be detected on brain scans, including responding to questions. Consciousness is located in the brain.

4) Personalities. I mean really we've already covered this, but again diseases of the brain like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's affect personality, as do some brain injuries. Conditions like prenatal alcohol exposure have predictable impacts upon personality.",2660295,,,,,,,,,,,

How can I handle being home alone?,2661060,hellworldprincess,"Sep 7, 2024 at 1:11 AM","I find it hard to deal with my partner going outside / doing stuff while I stay home. I've never been the type of person to go outside a lot, but recently I simply can't get myself to leave the house at all unless its absolutely necessary. And even then, there's a good chance I will stay home tbh.

My partner has a healthy social life and regularly does stuff with their friends. I've met the friend group and I think they're good people so why would I be worried? Also I'm technically invited to most of the social gatherings my partner attends so why would I ever be worried?

When it's late, I'm mostly worried about their safety. Although I trust in their strength and judgment, the world is a scary fucking hellscape.
During the day I worry mostly about the relationship and what my passivity will lead to. Why am I so boring? Why can't I just come with them although I may not feel like it?

Every time they leave I'm just sitting there doing something to numb my brain and waiting for them to come back.
When I can't or don't want to numb myself sufficiently, I sometimes fantasize about how much fun their having and how they're gonna realize at some point that having fun is just easier without me.

I don't want to be a hindrance to their relationships or interests under any circumstances. If I did anything to stop them from going to a party or a concert, that would make me feel even worse than I do right now. Also I hope to be able to come along with them in the future if I can ever imagine being okay outside of my home again.

What can I do to cope with being home alone?
How could I ask for texts while they're gone / affection after they come back without seeming too needy or like I want them to stay home?",,,,,,,,,,,,

How can I handle being home alone?,2661145,Forever Sleep,"Sep 7, 2024 at 3:13 AM","I think you need to be honest with your partner about this. So, say how nervous you feel about going outside and being around others but, also say that you don't want to hold them back. You're worried about both things.

Have you ever tried meeting their friends? Or, just visiting places with your partner? Maybe, it won't be as scary as you expect. Plus, if your partner knows how you feel, hopefully they'll be more supportive and start small.

I do understand though. I feel socially anxious a lot. Especially in groups. There's no way I could handle that sort of thing but I'm kind of fortunate that I'm pretty ok alone. Weirdly though, I think I would actually struggle more if I had someone and they were going out having fun. I do see where you're coming from.

Basically though- I think you need to try going out at least. To know for sure what kind of affect it will have on you. It might actually be ok or- really good and you may get less fearful. But, not telling them and just staying at home with these thoughts- which I imagine could start to become bitter, I don't think will help your relationship. Still, I'm the last person who should be trying to give relationship advice really- having never had one! So, feel free to ignore it also. Good luck though- whatever you decide.",,,,,,,,,,,,
How can I handle being home alone?,2661149,figcitylightscookie,"Sep 7, 2024 at 3:20 AM","What I've learned is repressing feelings only makes things worse. Trying to process your feelings hurts so much, but you suffer less because they will eventually pass. I think the typical answer would be to seek professional help since willingly cooping yourself up in your house for this long is not healthy. However, I will share some advice that doesn't involve that.

The first step should be to talk to your partner about your feelings. Distracting yourself while your partner is out (for example, by playing video games) only represses your feelings; you're shoving them away to feel them later, but they're never gone. An open discussion with your partner about your feelings will make you feel better by finding out whether these feelings are unnecessary or right. If you think it will make you feel better, ask them if they can occasionally text you while they're out or share their location with you; explain that this is temporary until you work on your anxiety. Managing your anxiety will make you a better partner for them.

The second step is to start leaving your house. You can start by hanging out with your partner's friends online by joining a Discord call; you can also find different servers and meet new friends. This will help you become more comfortable with other people's company. Next, you can invite friends to your home so you can spend time in your safe space. Afterward, you can leave the house for a short time in places near your home until you're finally comfortable going out again. Basically, the goal here is to take baby steps to go from staying home alone to getting to a point where you can enjoy parties and concerts with your partner.

It's important to be honest with yourself in situations like these. Journaling alongside these steps could help with that. If you don't want to seek outside help, venting to yourself (or other people if they're okay with it) can help you discover deep-seated issues you didn't realize before. Once you recognize these issues, you can take further steps to solve them.

I hope this helps, and good luck :) Please update us in the future if possible.",,,,,,,,,,,,
How can I handle being home alone?,2661380,hellworldprincess,"Sep 7, 2024 at 8:45 AM","My partner is aware of my social anxiety and is also quite understanding of me not being able to come along when they go out. I just think it's difficult to ask them to keep in contact via text without giving away that I feel bad when I'm home alone.
Before we moved in together about a year ago I didn't feel bad because of being home alone at all. I actually relished in every second my family was gone and I had the flat completely to myself.

I will try going out again at some point, but I have tried that a lot already and I think that atm bad experiences would reinforce my fear too much to risk it.
I have a therapist but we're not actively working on my anxiety issues.

You're totally right about repression not being the best thing in the long run, but it's my go-to for a lot of things, so it'll be hard to not also do that in this case.

I have met my partner's friend group and I get what they like about them. Sadly the mere fact that I'd have to spend time in a group made almost all opportunities to interact with them very uncomfortable.

Meeting people, joining discords etc. is kind of off the table for me at this point in time, but maybe I'll try to go to a museum with my partner alone sometime. That was the last outside experience I didn't regret subjecting myself to at least.

Being a human is the second worst curse that could happen to me,2661315,ijustwishtodie,"Sep 7, 2024 at 7:31 AM","The first worst curse ever is being a human with immortality. I acknowledge that many people love being a human but I'm talking about myself as this is my vent post. For me, being a human is the second worst curse ever for many reasons. It's obvious that I'm not meant to be a human as I suffer a lot due to it.

Being a human comes with many challenges and responsibilities. For some reason that's unfathomable to me, many people love challenges and hardship. However, in my case, I don't love challenges and hardship. I want an easy and stress free life. What makes being a human such a massive curse to me is that humans are forced to go through challenges and hardship whether they want to or not. There's genuinely no way out of it. The only way to not have to deal with challenges any more is via death but, since death is so regulated, suicide has a lot of challenges to it as well.

Additionally, I'm perpetually consumed by boredom and I also blame this to me being a human. I also have apathy and anhedonia meaning that I don't enjoy anything. I would enjoy things more if I wasn't a human and if I was free. Being a human is like being a prisoner trapped in chains.

Me being human also means that I'm subject to random chance of developing extreme suffering. It's entirely possible that, out of nowhere, I develop an excruciating, painful chronic health condition which increases my pain exponentially. Actually, one thing I hate about being a human is that humans feel a lot of pain. I'm no different. I feel mental pain whenever I'm forced to go through any challenges or hardship. It's just so unfair. I was born against my consent and I'm expected to do things that I don't want to do or to survive for as long as possible even though death is inevitable anyway.

Dealing with other humans also makes me hate that I'm a human. Most humans are shitty and aren't dealing with imo. I don't see anything good about other humans as they all would exploit me for their own gain if they could. It's just how humans operate as we're all self serving at the end of the day. I also don't see any joy in socialising and talking to others. I'd rather stay alone and solitary but the fact that I can't due to being forced to socialise makes me so miserable.

I will never understand people's love for being human because I think that, barring immortality, it's the worst curse ever",,,,,,,,,,,,

People seem to chose the option, of continuing with there existing life until there inevitable death. Though there justification is not that living for an extreme amount of time is bad, but rather that the inability to die will allow them to stay around long after the plant earth has exploded. Till There just floating around in space. This to me then says that if there was a reality in which they could live eternity and that the world they inhabit would never go extinct, that they would take immortality, over the far more rational option of being able to die during your life.

I was never able to truly understand this answer or the justification for it. It seem like people just seem to disregard all the pain and suffering they would inevitably experience in that never ending life, but rather they just optimistically hope for this elusive pleasure they seem to desire.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I would love to hear your thoughts on my idea…….you see….I have lost faith that I can obtain SN or Propromolol in Australia. I have an alternative method due to research in the PPH although I can't remember the year of publication, and I'd be so grateful to hear your thoughts. I'm in in excruciating physical pain, and have been for 6 years. I can't care for myself at all. And it's getting worse by the day. I have tried everything to help me but a tragic series of surgeries left me irreparable. Hence I need help thinking straight. I failed in an attempt with a N tank as I kept blowing a hole in the bag even with the special regulator. I spent 6 months and couldn't figure it out. The last few nights I have considered self immolation out in the middle of nowhere. I know it is painful, but it could also cause ctb which would make it temporary. And physical pain I am used to. However, I am not open to the idea of desperate suffocation or drowning. My idea is:

1. 0.5g of Valium (100 x 5mg tablets). Drink with 10ml of propylene glycol and measure of baileys.
2. NOTE: I also have access to Quetiapine and Instant and Slow Release Tapentadol to add on, if this would help knock me out for longer while the cardiac switch takes place. But I do have a tolerance to Tapentadol as I have been on these for a long time. I will also cease diazepam for many months prior to ctb to make it more effective.
3. Follow with CardioTxc combo: Digoxin 100mg and Amitryptiline 8g. Both drugs will be taken in a suspension.

What are the potential issues with this situation? Does anybody have advice on how to tackle that?

I have also looked at the possibility of using my last legs to fly somewhere to buy N and bring it back but due to my painful state, I need clear instructions and I am worried that a trip to Mexico for N won't be as easy as it was in 2008 when I read it in the PPH.

I'm also keen to pay someone to do it for me Goodfellas style but don't know how I would find such a person. Thank you in advance.

i used to see a guy every week until his attention toward me dwindled and i assured myself that if to meet his gaze meant to toil begrudgingly through the rest of the days of the week id do it. i skipped work for him, i made sure he didn't spend a dime around me, i satisfied every one of his awkward kinks, just so he'd continue keeping me around.

i get into these flings for an illusionary sense of purpose although i am ALWAYS inevitably hurt when i realize i am worth nothing more than a hook up to the other party.

i continue to fight off intent in hopes of finding my ""soulmate"" but i can barely find anyone who'd give me an ounce of attention outside of bed.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Important questions: it seems AE's r somewhat necessary for successful ctb via SN.
Is it correct that dimenhydrinate doesn't work with sn?
What are some more easily accessible AE's that could work?
What would failure with sn look like?(By not fasting or not having AE)? -> Have people who failed ended with any sort of permanent damage? Did they end up in the hospital? I'm aware of most sn symptoms but I'd like to know what symptoms to expect after failure in case, since right now I only have dimenhydrinate.
Mostly curiosity: Related to fasting, it's not an issue but mostly a curiosity if fasting increases the chances of success as I've heard about people dying by accidental sn consumption and I doubt they were fasting, or does it simply extend the process?
I've read about people having candy for the taste, would that not affect it?",,,,,,,,,,,,
"SN, AE and failure",2643317,esistzeit,"Aug 23, 2024 at 5:11 PM","I think that fasting speeds up the process. The SN is absorbed when it reaches your small intestine.

If your stomach is empty, on the other hand, it will go straight to the small intestine and you will pass out within 20 minutes, supposedly.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Not fasting, you will very likely throw it all up, keeping the SN from reaching your small intestine. IIRC, permanent damage is very rare, but it may be a survivorship bias. But most of the people who experienced SN failure here made it through without sequelae.

Accidents happen. But they don't happen often. You don't want to fuck it up, do you?

In winter I hit a really low point and made a stupid failed CTB attempt. After that I decided enough is enough and told about it to my friends and my partner. I said I was going through a very rough time and I asked them to be patient and be close to me. I asked them to give me a little bit more love.

I have no friends now. They started isolating me one by one. Last time I talked with most of them was May-June. My best friend talks to me once a month if I'm lucky. I guess they all saw me as a liability.

Right now I talk only to my boyfriend, who sees my alcohol problem as a fun quirk, and to my mom, who is completely unaware of my mental condition and has only seen my wrist scars from sh.

Why is this mostly so? In order to answer this question, it is necessary to cover a very wide range of factors and reasons, but a crucial reason would be a coded social anathema regarding CTB which, automatically, is accepted by the majority of the population without deep thinking. Religious dogmas in this regard also have their huge influence. If you contact friends who really care about you, they will also react to the mention of your CTB plan very negative and without the understanding that you somehow logically expect. As you are important to them, they do not want to lose you and will be uncompromisingly against it. Is it selfish? Partly yes, although I would underline that they probably do not have bad intentions. Socio-religious indoctrination and the need to have you by their side is stronger than their capacity to try to really understand you, it's simply a wall, a blockade that almost no one is able to cross, except in the case that they themselves have gone through (or are going through) similar difficulties and confrontations. in all other cases, expect misunderstanding, harsh opposition and, in more extreme cases, even some kind of rejection by them. In the case of people you consider your friends but they are not, you will also be met with a negative attitude and rejection, however, as they actually they don't care about you, the root of the negative attitude here is solely in socio-religious indoctrination and the automatic rejection of such, in their opinion, ""socially unacceptable procedure"".",,,,,,,,,,,,

You need people that will be there for you, care for your actual existence and that are capable of understanding things beyond the equivalent of 0+1- or ones that just have too much on their plate for that sort of thing, ectect. Unfortunately there are a lot of tards, snakes, fakes, or just people that aren't able to deal with it, you name it. However you may get to a point where you can finally build or gather a community of like minded people, that won't just drop you while you're down, just makes it seem fun and a positive thing, just essentially tells you your issues aren't that a big of a deal and ""all you have to do is just: x: and your issue won't exist anymore"" people

As perhaps unsaid as it is. 24/7 traumadumping- overloading people with it isn't good either- not saying you did. Just noting. Regardless, never actually having anyone that knows or understands you, you will feel lonely even if you are in a room with 20 people. Some groups of friends or acquaintences are just sorta there surrounding the topic/hobby of said group and just there to distract or have fun. Nothing is too wrong with that, maybe they'll understand and help with doing more of said group activity to get out of it rather than one being a ideal person to full on rant about your issues and whats going on. Some others may not be that way, others will be negative about it and turn it against you

So it's good to identify which people are which, but sticking to yourself will likely be rather damaging and won't tell you this information(this rule is abandoned if they were meant to be people you can rely on or open up to in the first place. You don't need them, if they are never gonna take you seriously then others will). Best you can do is constantly improve yourself, stay fairly open about things at least and take opportunities to find similar communities you can partake in- distract yourself, making friends along the way and real people that you can gather up. Easier said than done, takes time and you're gonna weed people out. Some people could have been right for you and fun, but they just didn't bother improving themselves and aren't a fit, vise versa. Regardless, not all sunshine and rainbows. People are morons and theres a shit ton of fakes that wanna try claim they'll be there for you but straight up ignore your texts. I for sure feel that and finding ones that are right for you isn't going to happen overnight. If you're gonna suffer regardless, what would you prefer to do? Not all too simple and easy anyway or seemingly possible

At least that's my current day opinion, there's probably various complications that make it harder to adopt that and so on. Not to mention this is just one persons view and thoughts. Everyone finds their own path, own solutions and decides what they want to deal with or be around. Don't give up soldier, or do, whatever you feel fits you in this moment. Idk we're on a suicide forum and people do gotta try their own solutions and ideas first to try feel better

Just final notes, if you open up to only therapists instead. As far as I'm aware you can't hint, say or claim you're actively trying or going to commit suicide. They will take action on that. Feeling suicidal, but having no intention is another thing. 2nd: being a nice or good person isn't letting people walk all over you and use you for their needs while ignoring you",,,,,,,,,,,,

I'd also say it can be problematic for the opposite reasons too. Opening up to people can make them highly concerned and possibly highly attentive- for a period of time. Maybe that could help some of us in the short-term. My concern though would be that perhaps few people can probably spare the time and (to be brutally honest,) the emotional resilience to be there that intently for a very long period of time. As my Dad used to be keen to point out- 'People will be sympathetic listening to your problems up to a point.' So- it could be that- once we've become dependent on them, they withdraw from us then.

Or- better case scenario. All that support works and, we start to feel better. What if we relapse though? We're suicidal again. Maybe we don't want to trouble them with it this time. Maybe we do but this time, their efforts don't seem to help us. Now we've got a whole lot more tethers keeping us here. For me, that's the last thing I want!

It feels like a scam to me because it gets us emotionally blackmailed into staying here because we made closer bonds with people we really don't want to hurt.

I had to talk to a helpline following the IC SN welfare checks and the woman on the other end was like: 'Promise me you'll call us before you attempt.' I just thought- What the hell? I don't owe you any kind of promise! That would be much harder coming from a loved one though.

Opening up is a scam.,2660904,HereTomorrow,"Sep 6, 2024 at 9:47 PM","At least from experiences and what is taught to the public, opening up to someone about suicide is intended to be a direct pipeline to professional help/medical attention. You cannot tell someone about suicidial thoughts without the strong possibility of them going to someone else or urging you to get help. And if you do not, they are often told to ditch you, as only you can fix yourself and anything more is attention seeking. It is a waste of emotional energy to open up if you have no plan to be directed to professional help.

At the same time, hearing about someone being suicidial, passive or active, is difficult to digest, as I've been on both sides. Just dropping ""I'm struggling so much and I want to kill myself"" is very tempting to a friend at any given moment, it's relieving. Saying you're suicidial or you've attempted can bring on a perspective of them imagining you're already gone, which is why it's stressful. Some are jerks and will ditch at a moment's notice, yes, but they don't want to say the wrong things, or be ""dragged"" down by the conversation(s), so for their health, they leave, worsening you. These friends say you're not a burden so they won't feel responsible for an attempt but I feel like they find openly suicidial people to be such.

You can't win either way. You either get help and/or ruin the relationships of those closest to you if you speak too truthfully.

The only way I've ever successfully spoken about suicide after losing most of my friends was informing one of my few remaining friends ahead of time I wanted to talk about something personal and asked if they're ready to emotionally digest it before half lying and saying I'm no longer suicidal but in a lot of pain and claiming it was all in the past. Still took a lot, but she understood, thanked me, and said she needed time alone for a month before pretending I never even said it and treats me normally.

arguing with the suicidal seems disingenuous,2661206,lamargue,"Sep 7, 2024 at 4:45 AM","pro-life and pro-choice discourse seems to require that we have faithful representatives in order to make a sound case for why the pro-choice position should be considered a rational one, and this is undermined by the fact that many on the pro-life spectrum believe those who suffer from suicidal ideation to be inherently irrational and thus incapable of sound argument. i've come to realize that arguing through logic alone is insufficient for understanding the opposing side. it's necessary to be empathic in dealing with opposing ideals, especially when those voicing dissent in our views may not be able to represent their arguments faithfully due to some impairment on their part.

in the case of the suicidal, i would argue that many are not in a state wherein they can convey their arguments faithfully, due to variables which might undermine how they express their views. for instance, those suffering from depression may not have the energy to convey themselves faithfully, despite believing themselves to be fully capable of rational thought; in a verbal setting, this capacity may be overlooked in favour of debating ability, which is conflated with how faithful they are to their original position. there are inevitably going to be those who aren't entirely consistent in their views, and thus might be refuted on the basis of some small technicality; the particular circumstances involved in ones desire to die might not be articulable in an entirely rational way, which may present itself as an opportunity for those who oppose the suicidal individual's position to make deflationary claims in order to underscore their general pro-life sentiment. this is not to undermine the intelligence of those who are suicidal, but rather that the pro-life position tends to rely on anecdotal justification (""i've tried to argue with X in the past, and i perceived that the entire argument was inconsistent.. so clearly those who hold such ideas are inherently incapable of according with what i perceive to be rational -- they are impaired due to circumstances such as depression which cloud their thoughts!"") in order to proactively deny the pro-choice position, according as those who are not the best representatives are tasked with defending the entire stronghold.

it can be extremely tiring to argue against a status quo position, especially when you lack the energy to do so. the burden should fall on those in the pro-life position to be more empathic in their reasoning; if an individual is incapable of strongholding the gamut of pro-choice views, this might be because they lack the capacity to convey their points in debate, and not necessarily the inherent contradictions of such a position. this to me seems very common on a local level i.e trying to have others understand your own intentions, despite protest

maybe this applies more to a pro-mortalist position, which is more philosophical, yet is often a form of justifying ones own suicidal intent",,,,,,,,,,,,
arguing with the suicidal seems disingenuous,2661222,willitpass,"Sep 7, 2024 at 5:13 AM","I fall into the camp of being very certain that I am making a reasonable and rational decision to CTB but being far too depressed and pessimistic to be able to argue with anyone who says otherwise. I hardly have energy to do anything other than lay in bed doing nothing anymore, being an activist for change and debate isn't exactly on my radar. I know the fact that I struggle to get myself to brush my teeth would only be used against me to claim that I'm ""not of my right mind"", which is quite unfortunate. I believe I make strong and reasonable arguments to my need to CTB, but I know that will never be perceived that way by someone who is convinced they know what's best for me. If they spent a day in my head maybe, just maybe, it would be enough for them to see someone can be both rational and in mental agony at the same time. And maybe it's the depression or maybe it's just me, but it feels futile. It's not something most people are ever going to be willing to change their opinion on. This is a very emotionally charged and decisive topic without much room for change. Believing suicide is not always the wrong choice will likely always be the minority.",,,,,,,,,,,,

If you're under a S136, you'll be at or get taken to, a place of safety / S136 suite.

There they will do a mental health act assessment. The outcome could be several things - you get a further section and involuntary detained, they ask you to admit yourself voluntarily (but if you don't, this is often made involuntary) or they let you go.

If your mental state is purely a result of the alcohol and nitrous ox, they may see if they can manage you in the community first. They will always try and go the least restrictive route.

,2660608,illandlonely,"Sep 6, 2024 at 6:03 PM","I found out I was trans relatively young (around 14, I'm mtf btw), I took a while till I was able to get on hormones, I had a transphobic doctor's and support system plus I was kicked out of my place at 16 so it made it hard to do anything but survive for a while.

Ctb has always been on my mind until I took hormones, and for what felt like a brief moment in my life that lasted just 2 years I felt like living. Right now, I feel like the repression of my true emotions about my life has finally leaked out.

Being trans has both satisfed alot of my mental stress and added a bunch more. Sometimes when the disphoria is bad I'll present as feminine as possible, though this has caused me to be cat called and get sexually harassed a lot. So then I try and back down to more modest feminine clothes, then I'll just get mis gendered or harassed for being visibly trans. No matter what I do I feel like I'll never be right, I'll never fit in, not even other trans ppl like me, they always seemed annoyed I even approached them. I don't have any friends and whenever I try to be social to anyone they all give me the same disgusted look when they hear my deep voice yap.

I always sorta knew I was gay but I remember finding out what being trans was when I was maybe 14 and thinking ""I wish I had been born a boy. I would be happier."" but I didn't get to really dwell on that thought as I was shipped off to a Christian school where I tried so so hard to be hetero for the sake of my dads approval.

I became homophobic and transphobic in an effort to bury these parts of me to where I wouldn't feel them anymore. When the covid lockdown happened I was forced to slow down and just think. It was during that time that I really accepted my sexuality and began researching different gender identities. I got a binder through a mass giveaway and started wearing it. Even though it brought me physical discomfort due to the size of my chest I felt more like myself when I was wearing it.

I feel like now that I've opened the floodgates the dysphoria won't stop or go away. I don't really bind anymore because of how uncomfortable it feels so I spend my time trying not to think about my chest at all. I try not to think about how I'm probably stuck with my chest the way it is forever because when I do I just start to break down. I was on T for a few months before anxiety caused me to stop.

My voice makes me dysphoric too; I just don't sound like I wish I did. Not even close. I spend every day trying not to think about any of this. If killing myself meant I would be reborn as a man I would do it immediately without hesitation.",2660608,,,,,,,,,,,

,2630861,OverIt1976,"Aug 13, 2024 at 9:27 PM","So, I've been looking around for the last few weeks, and finally thought I would drop a line or 900 about my state of mind and the utter darkness I am in.

TBH, I did have a good childhood. Never wanted for anything, had awesome summer vacations with the family, great neighborhood and kids to play with. Live in Northern Utah so we always went to Yellowstone, all the national parks around Utah and the area. Extended family in northern, central and SoCal. So, it was good. Older brother and sister, younger sister and two parents that never divorced (which is rare). Lived in farmland next to the Great Salt Lake. Sleepouts on the trampoline, sleepouts at friends houses or in the backyards. Staring up and seeing the whole Milkyway instead of all this light pollution 40 years later. Winters filled with lots of snow. Digging tunnels to crawn through. Building igloos and sledding down the slope of the corn silage at my friends house.

I was always a kid who thought outside the box. Sometimes I would get in trouble for that. In elementary I was in a class called ""Resource"", what would be called Special Ed. I had difficulty studying and staying on task, even though I scored high on proficiency tests and IQ. I just co. uldn't be assed to do any of the work needed for the teachers. I would get in trouble for coloring an elephant green, or a banana blue. I always had weird concepts that most people didn't, or still don't understand. But, I never thought anything about it. I never knew I was wrong. I never knew I was abnormal and not like everyone else. The one thing I did know that I was different about was that I like boys.

Shopping for groceries with my mom was an excuse to run to the magazine stand and stare at the bodybuilding magazines and the men's fitness. The 1980's produced a lot of great bodybuilders. I was 6 when I knew that something was ""off"". Kissing girls was a vomitous thought. Slowly through time I developed crushes on my boy-friends. Not boyfriends, but boy (space) friends. First one was Joseph. He was gorgeous. We were both in the 3rd grade. Mrs. Carpenter's class. It was in the old part of West Point Elementary. We both would huddle at recess and play in the sand and just have fun. Don't get me wrong, I did have friends, a lot of friends. But on the other side I did have those kids who would bully me. No one knew. Not until junior high. In first grade I remember wearing a Mr. T tee-shirt and this group of 4th graders would corner me and taunt me and ask ""you think you're tough like Mr. T?"". Silly and stupid when you think about it. But as a first grader, I was mortified. I didn't tell anyone. No one at all. I just slunk my head and took the shame and embarrassment, hoping not to be beaten up.

This is one of the few things I would change if I had a TARDIS, or if time travel was real. I would go back and tell my younger self to throw a punch. Fuck em. Hit em till they hurt. Would save me a lifetime of regret and cowardice. I was never taught how to defend myself. Instead I developed my sarcasm and wit that I used to make people laugh. As I grew older I fine tuned it into a weapon. If I can't use my fist to make someone hurt, by god, I will eviscerate them with my words. Even to this day, I know how to hurt someone deeply, in a very fundamentally fucked up way. I was always cool with teachers, except Mrs. Povey. For some reason we clashed hardcore. 5th grade was tough.

Then we come to 7th grade. That year was good enough. Went to junior high and met new kids and made friends. This was when my reality of who I was deep down was surfacing and forging my identity. Well, my inner identity. This was the late-80's. Fuck if I was going to alert anyone to who I thought I was. I didn't want to open that because I knew what it was, and I knew the world's view, especially in a Mormon dominated state. So, I did my thing. Made friends (hung out with them and then... comes mid-year 7th grade 1988.

Absolutely the worst time I ever had up to this point. Dustin Po***ck. Deranged monster of a kid. Made my life hell. Tormenting me, threatening me harassing me and being absolutely ugly. ""Hey fem"", ""hey fag"", ""faggot"", ""fairy""... if you can think of it, I was called it. Again, I slunk down and avoided confrontation. I took it. I took it because I was terrified that if people knew that he was right, it would ruin my life. Growing up in the 80's in Utah with a church that abhors homosexuality and overtly preaches their intolerance... yeah, I kept silent. Imagine going to church when you're puberty begins and you're sexual identity is blooming and being taught you will go to hell for who you are at the core. That fucks with your head. It's no wonder Utah has a very high suicide rate among LGBT kids.

Summer of 1989 was good. Out of school. Dustin was out of my life and I had the entire summer to just fuck around. August 29th. Horrific day. We get a phone call that my grandpa was in the hospital for a pain in his inner thigh. We kids stayed home while mom and dad went to Salt Lake (40 miles south). Parents come back and tell us that grandpa had died. Aneurism. It had burst before they could do anything. Everyone thought he had pulled a muscle in his groin because they were rigging up the motorhome to head to Starr Valley in Idaho for some summer golfing. I remember being at their house while everyone was talking and making plans. I was on the side of the house were they parked their RV crying and hearing my grandma talking to someone on the phone. I remember hearing her say that she felt ""Bud"" (grandpa) comfort her last night. That still sticks with me. Making me 5% agnostic and 95% atheist. The services were somber. My aunt was almost inconsolable when they closed and secured the casket. The I don't remember much from the graveside service. I was still sad. I was grandpas ""turkey"" and my younger sister was his ""lap pooch"". He was a great man. He gave me my first taste of wine and beer. He had a wicked sense of humor. Always smelled like Elsha cologne. Hair slicked back with his Brylcream and his bolo-tie. Grandma was... different. She wasn't overly loving or liked being a grandma. That was my perception. She was more into entertaining and drinking. You have to remember, their heyday was the 1950's.

So, I moved into 8th grade with a huge hole in my heart. And ding dong! guess who comes back to school. Dickface Dustin. Same bullshit, different year. I got caught skipping gym and was hauled into Mrs. Sullivan's office. She was the vice principal. She grilled me until I broke down and told her what was going on. Mom and dad get called. Great... now I have to tell them I've been bullied for two years and god knows what they will say. Mom was more pissed at this kid, dad didn't understand why I didn't defend myself more. However, they were supportive and understanding. A few weeks later Dustin is nowhere to be seen. Didn't know why, nor did I give a shit. He was gone! I came out of my shell a little bit and life was good.

So, life was essentially good through then and high school. In high school I got into the drama crowd. I was friends with all cliques, belonging to none if we are going to be honest. I met Jimmy. We became best friends in 11th grade. My 10th grade was made up of confusion and unbearable friend. She wanted more, but I couldn't do it. The only reason I was friends with her is because her brother was simply gorgeous. I did love her, as a friend. We hung out all the time, went to Lagoon and got into crazy hijinks. But she wanted more. I had to tell her that I wasn't going to be anything more than a friend. She downed a lot of sleeping pills and I had to rush her to the hospital. At this time Jimmy and I were just acquaintances through the drama crowd. He had seen my other friend and I rush Nic out of the Commons and to the hospital. He showed up and consoled me. From then we were best friends.

High school was just tolerable. Nothing noteworthy. Just... bleh. Graduated May 1994 with like a 1.8 gpa. Not very scholastic I know. I'm not dumb. I like to think I'm pretty intelligent. I just never had use for regurgitating facts for adults that needed to grade me on my recitation. So, now that I'm out of school it's time to do what 99% Americans are supposed to do. Get a job. (See post about jobs I've had). Still hiding my true self, but summer of 1995 I get a job as a checker in a local grocery store. One of the managers who we will call Dave, was a giant flamer. But he was cool. He knew I was gay. One day he invited me and three other co-workers to his house for a dinner. The other co-workers were much older, and knew he was gay. I did accept. He told me that he was gay. This was after hours as we were counting down the tills. I took a deep breath and for the first time in my life I uttered the words I never wanted to say. I told him I was too. He hugged me and I started crying. It was a huge relief. There was nothing sexual about it. He was much older, but he was kind. He took me under his wing, taught me which bars didn't ID, and which queens to watch out for. Gave me a boo to read about a bodybuilder who was gay and never wanted to come out, but he and his boyfriend were becoming more prominent and it was a story of their coming out.

At the time I was still living with my parents and I had my own half bath. I would keep the book under the sink beneath all of the towels. My mother found the book. I get home from work and she and my dad pull me into the front room and we have a discussion. My dad was having none of it. My mom just kept reciting gays going to hell and the ""outer darkness"" (Mormon hell). My dad made some very crude remarks. I was dumbfounded. This wasn't how I wanted this to go. So, for about 6 months I would avoid my parents. My mom would walk in a room, I would walk out. I was 19, but put on a very strict curfew. 10pm weeknights when not at work and midnight on weekends. I remember just arguing with my mom about a pride sticker I had on my car. I told her it's none of her fucking business. My brother rushed up the stairs and knocked me to the ground. I remember gathering all of my strength and standing up with him still on top of me. I start yelling about my brother having a fairy for a brother and him calling me a fudge-packer and me quipping back that I do like fudge.

My brother and I had a very tumultuous relationship. Mostly about how I behaved towards my parents. Which we will get into later. So, at this time my parents called Jimmy over and I had to come out to him. He was pissed. Kept telling me how the Book of Mormon and Bible feel about it and how I will be going to hell and how disappointed he was in me. From that point our friendship quickly disintegrated. My family never got it. They never understood how damaging it was to hear that. I can't be friends with someone with views like that. This is where I start diverging my stories because life gets complicated.

Suffice it to say I lost friends, but family stood by me until recently. More on that later. So, I meet this girl who would turn out to be the biggest mistake of my life. No, not a girlfriend. My friend. We met through a mutual friend. We bonded over my obsession with Erasure. We slowly became close and we did everything together. She got married and it seemed that all three of us were this happy family. Then, her, her husband and her mother get into a huge car accident. Husband was driving. He became addicted to pain-killers which eventually ended their marriage. Her mother was like my second mother. J (second mom) was in her early 70's and very cool. She eventually developed dementia and I helped take care of her along with my friend and her husband. I was living with J at the time and she became so incapacitated that she had to live in a home. Left me alone worrying about bills and rent, even though my friend said that her and her brother would help me out, which they didn't.

J died in Oct 2005. It felt like a piece of me died. My first attempt was in November that year. I was working at the IRS in the Power of Attorney department. Had been with the IRS since Feb 2001. Friend asked me why I did it, and I told her that she promised to help, and never did and the anxiety of bills became too unbearable. She then proceeded to block me from her life because her mom had just died, as did her favorite cat. Ok, I get that. Slowly we reconnect. Become inseparable again. She and her husband adopted a 16 year old. Soon after they divorce leaving my friend to raise this kid alone. That was about 2010. So two years of hanging out with the son and my friend. It was a good time, but I felt like she was needing me to fill in as a father figure, which I wouldn't do.

Sept 2012. The beginning of the end. I met W (who later became my husband). He was short, fat and bald, and a registered sex offender. But I thought well... this is it, can't find any guys that will want to be with me. So I settled. He was living with a guy who was under investigation for child porn, so his PO told us to move out. We got a spall place of our own. But W's loud mouth got us kicked out of three places before we had to move in with the child porn guy who had moved to North Carolina. I sold everything. Uprooted my life and moved to shithole North Carolina. Shelby. Two years scraping by while he was a chronic unemployed shitface dick. One day (two days after my 41st birthday) he said he wants to open the marriage. I'm like no. Rule one and two. No cheating and no open relationships. Fuck that. But, to be fair he was becoming more and more repulsive to me and I wouldn't sleep with him. He would always check my phone, my Facebook and my emails. Like go for it dude, I have nothing to hide. His phone dinged and I looked at it. A text from a guy in the neighboring city telling W that they're ready for him to come over and gang-bang. I hit the roof. Instead of him feeling like shit, he got pissed I looked at his phone. I laughed. Called my mom and told her to get me the fuck home. She and my older sister got me a flight back to SLC. I move in with my parents and file for divorce. Yes, I'm leaving a lot out.

Because of W, I lost my job of 14 years at the IRS. Had to file bankruptcy, lost my car and ruined my credit and my self esteem. I felt like nobody. Even though he sexually repulsed me, i still felt violated on the most fundamental level. I try to get my life back on track and try finding jobs that turn into shit and I get fired or quit. 2017 until 2020 life was just fucked. Job after job. The Trump election was more than I could even bear. I would post my opinions and my feeling on him, religion and the Republican party. So much so that my younger sister posted a meme on Instagram and tagged me in it. It was of an elderly couple pushing an overweight bearded man in a stroller. I hit the fucking roof. I message my younger sister to fuck off and I began blocking everyone in the family on social media. Everyone.

Later that night my older sister barges into my parents house and into my room and just barrages me with insults and nastiness. I'm worthless, I'm a mooch and I have no worth whatsoever. Telling me that I'm always playing on the computer instead of looking for jobs, to which I turned my laptop to her and showed her I was filling out an application. She kept at it, non-stop. My dad telling her to shut up, telling me to shut up. My mom in the doorway not knowing what's going on. Annie shaking to death because it's so loud. She kept at me about being useless and just being so ugly. I finally yelled at her and called her a cunt. Not a nice word, but still, you act like one, you're going to be called one. She flips out harder and starts throwing things at me. I was more pissed that she throw my bag of SweetTarts and they flew everywhere. I just laughed at her. And I remember saying ""Okay, little girl, you can go now"". My dad getting in my face with his fist after calling her a cunt. I dared him to hit me, and if he does he needs to hit my sister for the gross things she was slinging at me.

My sister storms out. I am in such a crazed state that I grab my backpack, head down to my dad's bedroom and grab his two guns. It's a very Republican house, so guns are like dust, they're everywhere. I stuff them in my backpack and start walking down the street while on the phone with my friend. As I'm recounting what had happened her two sons come roaring down the road in their ""sorry about your small dick"" truck. They get our and start threatening me. It came to a point where they were making fun of my weight, my ex-husband and how the older one wants to beat the shit out of me so bad. So, I turn and put my glasses on the top of his hood. Before I could even turn around that punk ass clicks me in the back of the head. I go down. They start punching me and kicking me. Finally they stop. Apparently the two guns fly out of the bag. The younger fuck calls the cops. I limp back home and tell my dad that his grandsons say hi. My dad runs out and start yelling at them that everything was under control. The cops get their statement and mine. They had the nerve to say that I stepped into the street to stop them. As if I knew what kind of fucking hillbilly bumpkin fuck they drive.

While being verbally assaulted before being physically attacked the older son was telling me all of this shit that my older sister said to him. Lies about discussions her and I have had, or reactions to her unable to help me out that I never reacted to. So, police leave, mom helps me clean up. The house calms down and I start my third day of work the next day. A few days later after I get home I was sat down with mom and dad and they told me that I have to leave by Thursday. This was a Monday. They didn't feel safe with me and the guns. They didn't like not having family over because the family doesn't like me. My sister thought I was going to use those guns on her fucks. I explained until I was blue in the face that I never knew the fucks would be storming over. I was going to use them to ensure success on blowing my face off. But, I still had to leave.

I spent the next three days scouting a place to live. Three days of anxiety and pressure to leave. I had no money. None. What the fuck was I supposed to do. I finally found a place in buttfuck ghetto Ogden. Mom and dad said they would pay for the move in. I still feel like it was out of guilt. They wanted me out by Thursday because they were going to Baja California that weekend. Wow. I couldn't move in until that Saturday, so they agreed to let me stay while they were in Mexico. The entire family was there. I've never been invited anywhere, even when we were all on good terms. So, I move into this 267 square foot studio. No AC, a dinky wall insert heater. But it was a newly remodeled residence and I was the first one in the building.

No one in the family wanted to talk about what happened so we could all move past it. My resentment grew and my hatred of my sisters grew and my absolute disgust of my two nephews reached an all time high. Still, no one wanted to talk about it. Sweep sweep sweep everything under the rug. Out of site, and out of mind. So, I marinated in my hatred in that shitty apartment. Let me make clear that I love my parents. Even though I think they overreacted and I was the one that took the brunt of my older sister's hysteria and my nephew's criminal violence. My mom calls me one day to tell me that my younger sister's husband had been involved in an ATV accident. Bad. Like TBI bad. Unresponsive and might now come out of his coma. He was in the coma for a long time. He did recover a little, but died as a result of the injury. While he was in the hospital I did sent a little get well gift. Not one word from my sister.

I wasn't invited to the funeral. I wasn't even acknowledged for any part of it. So, not only do I look like a fuck for not being there, It makes me look like a bigger fuck because I wasn't allowed to send a heartfelt letter to my sister. I had put aside everything and wrote her this, what I consider, a beautiful letter expressing my deep sadness of losing her husband. Denied. I mourned alone. I still struggle with it. I didn't like the guy much, but my sister was hurting and I couldn't be there for her. Gutted.

So, more job losses more self loathing and self hatred. More wishing I was dead. More wishing the earth should open it's fiery maw and devour all humans because we are all garbage and none of us deserve to breathe in the air that sustains us. I get a job working for the State of Utah. Coosh job. Nice. I move into a nice one-bedroom apartment in downtown Salt Lake City. I lose that job. So, I begin to worry and hate my life more. Get another job that pays ... meh... decent, but not enough. Lose that job. Depression because I have to have my parents help me with car payments and rent. My parents pay off my car and help with several months of rent. My rent isn't cheap. I finally get a shitty WFH job. I just got fired from that. No zero income.

I know you're thinking that boohoo... this fat fuck whinging about money when we have real problems. I haven't even started about my love life (or lack thereof). Being rejected left and right. Being ridiculed and harassed. Falling in love and get that they feel the same only to be fucked off. I'm not sure that I have conveyed my inner demons. It's a culmination of job losses and heartbreak and family disaster. Yes, most of this is my fault. But what hurts the most is that during the middle of all of this I was hospitalized for a week for suicide attempt. No one in my family except my mom gave any support. My friend (with the kid) decided that while I was in there it would be a good idea to be present for a phone meeting of support and then proceed to tell me to fuck off. She had gotten bariatric surgery and lost some weight. Still fat, but she thought she was a skinny bitch. But I supported her. Went to all of her classes. She once told me to let her know if she became one of those vapid bitches we hate... well... she passed that mark by a mile.

That was the second time she fucked me off after a suicide attempt. This person who I thought I would grow old with and be two angry bitches in our rockers on the porch yelling at kids and throwing screaming cats at them. She hurt me more than my ex ever did. My anger and apathy for her is unlike anything I've ever had.

I called my sister a few weeks ago (the one who threw my candy at me). I was watching tv and got emotional and started crying. I called her and wanted to let her know I love her and that I was sorry for everything. During this whole conversation it was me apologizing and her repeating how she helped me out while I was married and how much money she helped me out with. And how much I had hurt everyone. At no point did she take responsibility for anything that she did. As if she was angelic for this whole fucking thing. I told her I was very lonely and missed everyone. ""I'm sure you are"". That's all she said. So... like what the fuck.

I sit in the apartment, alone with my Annie. Watching tv. Wishing for a quick release. Wishing that I had a catalyst to ignite that spark and pull the fucking plug. I lie away at night thinking about ways to do it. I am always thinking about it. I'm thinking about what to wear, what I should say, how I should behave before I do, make sure I leave notes about bank accounts and shit like that. But since I have no job anymore, I wont have any insurance, so yay.

I've fucked up this life. There is no joy. There is no happiness. If there is it only comes in short bursts, but those are rare. I a sick of feeling like a failure. I'm sick of the endless anxiety in the back of my head and the self hatred that voices my ineptitude of life. Maybe everyone is right. I'm a failure at everything. I mean, I really am. Jobless, about to be homeless. So depressed that I shower maybe once a week. Apartment is disheveled. Not a shithole, but not tidy either. So low on energy that I don't want to take Annie for her potty breaks, but I have to because I love her too much to let her be uncomfortable.

So, I can predict what will happen. I will be up all night, sleep all days. Apply for jobs that I am qualified for, but will be denied because of my age and track record. Thus cycling in the depression and anxiety. So, why not just fuck it and end it before the rent is due? Right?",,,,,,,,,,,,

Or perhaps you don't have the privacy at home to hang yourself?

Or perhaps you don't want your corpse to soil and rot in your house?
Or perhaps you don't want people to end up thinking that you will haunt your house?

As you can see, there are plenty of excellent, robust anchor points outdoors that are guaranteed to hold your weight. I recommend you take a walk and really analyse and inspect your surroundings so that you can find as many anchor points as possible and pick the one you like most.

Hope this helps as many of you as possible!",,,,,,,,,,,,
,2628554,itsactuallyover127,"Aug 12, 2024 at 4:57 AM",Any ideas for possible anchor points at home though?,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2628575,Evelyn Lane,"Aug 12, 2024 at 5:20 AM","I guess a doorway pull-up bar, a shower curtain rod or a ceiling fan.

Note however that I've heard stories of them falling down (all three of them).

Some people advise tying a rope to the doorknob and throwing the rope over the top of the door, but I've heard tales of doorknobs coming off the door or breaking.

Meanwhile, if you use one of the anchor points mentioned above, you can have more confidence in knowing it will hold your weight (a tree might give up, but only if you pick a bad one).

Hope this helps",2628554,,,,,,,,,,,

So I thought of sharing what I've found to be the best hanging spots outside the house.
Also note that not everyone cares about traumatising others or the corpse being photographed for a gore site (this can happen even if you kill yourself at home, keep in mind - and also, once you're dead you won't care about it anyway, some people don't care about it even while alive).

And suffer alive? No, I refuse. Also, I know that full suspension hanging is one of the least painful methods while, at the same time, being very highly reliable. I appreciate your concern, but I do not share the same concerns.

Hope that clears up my stance on this
I have considered CO and SN, but I still pick hanging, because it's more reliable and I'm less likely to be saved and end up with catastrophic brain damage (since I'll do this at night). Also because I lose consciousness faster than those other methods. And I find it to be less unpleasant than the other methods and also, a more natural way to die, since I view the carotid artery to be nature's power off button. It's the classical suicide method since ancient times.",2628591,2628594,,,,,,,,,,

In principle, I would prefer home whenever posible. You can prepare and test your setup in advance, and when you are completly in the mood you can do it instantly.

In an era when suicide is harder than ever, those in great pain are told to endure even more, how they have the obligation to stand for others (who would almost never reciprocate in the future), or shouldn't do it at all.

You're shooting yourselves in the foot. Most people wants and will want to make suicide impossible, and by contributing you aren't helping anyone. As I said before, someone will always suffer, the question is why you? Do you think the most extreme pain of wanting to end yourself compares to anything else, no matter how big they are?

I am currently working at a job that does not give me pleasure, and it is unlikely that I will ever be able to reach my place. I still do self-harm to this day, although it has been so many years, it has rather become a habit. Of the attempts to leave, there were only attempts to cut my veins and jump off a bridge, drink strong drugs by the ton, but here and there I just stopped out of fear. You can't get on the roofs, no matter how much you try, there are guards everywhere, and if you did, you were cowardly again. I can't hang myself, because all the chandeliers were removed in my house and because of this there is no place to hang a rope (I haven't tried on other things yet, such as a battery or a door handle, it seems to work for someone) I am an absolute gray mouse, unable to even understand if I love my young man, because I like girls more, but because of society, I have to pretend that I love men and thereby ruin both my life and the life of a young man. I can't look the way I want because of my relatives, and I can't protest, because I'm completely spineless, unable to defend my rights. And all this is because of the intense self-hatred. I have low self-esteem, I do not consider myself beautiful or successful in anything, I often aggress others, but I continue to build myself up as an ideal person, although I am not. Despite this, even the most meaningless and stupid situations can give me satisfaction for a moment from the fact that I live, whether it's a talkative passerby with funny stories or colleagues stupidly joking at work. No matter how much I try to leave, fear always begins, and it's not clear, maybe I don't want to die, but I want it all to stop.

But after so many years, trying and hurting myself has become a habit and now I can't stop and I hope that one day I will be able to leave without cowardice, no matter how painful or painless, the main thing is just to leave. I want to hear your thoughts and your stories, at least something, at least somewhere to hear what I was missing - an opinion on this and your feelings, thoughts. I've never been able to speak out about this to absolutely anyone, and it's all growing like a huge balloon, because the people around me were able to get out of this state, and to this day I'm drowning in this shit.

I think by the time someone makes it to a suicide forum, it's not so much about ""trying to make them feel better"" as it is about supporting them as best as possible, reinforcing that they're not alone, and trying to help them get through the moment.

I mean, if anybody can ""feel better"" as a result of coming here, great. But to me (and some members may disagree with me on this), the goal here is to be supportive of a person's choice while also helping people survive where and when we can.

When somebody is so far deep and down in suffering as you and the rest of us are, ""trying to make them feel better"" is kind of like pushing someone to run a marathon before they're even able to walk. They've gotta walk, first. They've gotta survive the moment, first.

When I first had suicidal thoughts- aged 10, they frightened me- in part because of this. It didn't take long though to realise that these beliefs weren't actually mine.

As I aged, I became more and more doubtful about orthodox religions. It made sense why certain religious ideas were popularised at certain times- including the idea of suicides going to hell. I wish I could find the YouTube video I saw ages ago... But yeah, it makes a lot of sense to me that religion is another tool for the ruling classes to keep the rest of us in order. They can't have their assets- in the form of their wage slave workforce killing themselves all over the place.

Die Methode die ich für mich gefunden habe (Exit Bag mit Stickstoff) eignet sich NICHT, wenn man etwas haben möchte, dass man mal eben so schnell umsetzten kann. Man muss wirklich klar bei Verstand sein, sich mit den technischen Gegebenheiten auseinandergesetzt haben und die entsprechenden Dinge kaufen (kosten insgesamt etwas über 300 Euro).

Da es eine ausführliche Beschreibung auf deutsch gibt, hänge ich diese einfach mal hier als pdf an.

Ich übernehme keinerlei Verantwortung für die Richtigkeit der Beschreibung(en) und bin nicht verantwortlich für die, die die Absicht haben es nachahmen zu wollen. Auch ich habe die Informationen aus Quellen sammeln müssen und verlasse mich auf das was dort steht, jedoch - jeder und jede ist selbst dafür verantwortlich was er tut !!!

Da ich auch medizinische Berichte über Erfolge mit dieser Methode gelesen habe, gehe ich davon aus, dass es ein relativ sicherer und sanfter Tod ist sofern man sich an die technischen Gegebenheiten und Schritte die beschrieben werden auch strikt hält.

,1083307,BeBraveBrother,"Jan 11, 2021 at 12:09 PM","Wenn man es in einer einsamen Hütte macht und an der Tür unmissverständlich deutlich warnt dann stellt es keine Gefahr für andere dar.
Das Problem ist echt die richtige Konzentration zu erreichen. Ich hatte die damals hoch genug um bewusstlos zu werden aber nicht bewusstlos zu bleiben. War dann ein Zustand den ich meinem wünsche. Auch ist es recht aufwändig- man muss erstmam draußen einen Grill anzünden den man rein bringt oder einen Stromgenerator haben bei dem man weiß dass er für die Raumgröße genügend CO produziert ohne dass die Konzentration wieder abfällt, weil etwas Schwund ist fast immer.

Kohlenmonoxid ist im Grunde wie Exit Bag - man bedient sich Hypoxie/Anoxie - also dem Verlust von Sauerstoffversorgung für den Körper. Bei Kohlenmonoxid geht es nur eben langsamer. Das CO muss ins Blut und Blutkörperchen vom Sauerstofftransport abblocken.
Und da man eben nicht weiß wie hoch die Konzentration ist kann das schon mal dauern und einem ist übel, schwindelig...
Bei reinem Stickstoff hat man gleich sofort keinen Sauerstoff mehr und ist nach 15 bis 40 Sekunden bewusstlos. Während der 15 bis 40 Sekunden hat man bei sauberer Ausführung (siehe pdf) auch keine erstickungsgefühle. Stickstoff ist ein Gas das wir ohnehin die ganze Zeit einatmen weil unsere Luft die wir in diesem Moment atmen zu 79% aus Stickstoff und nur zu 21% aus Sauerstoff besteht. Das pure stickstoff bewirkt lediglich dass die 21% Sauerstoff eliminiert werden wozu man eben die Tüte braucht um einen Raum zu schaffen indem das möglich ist. Da der Körper auf die CO2 rückatmung nicht jedoch auf sauerstoffverlust mit erstickungsgefühlen reagiert bleibt das erstickungsgefpjl aus - man kann ja das CO2 weiter ausatmen bis die Atmung irgendwann mit dem Tod aussetzt wobei man aber längst bewusstlos ist.

Zwar reicht bei CO ein luftanteil von nur 1-1,5% aber das muss man erstmal so schnell hergestellt bekommen und halten können.
Wenn man das nicht hinbekommt leidet man sehr unter den Symptomen des Sauerstoffmangels ohne Bewusstlosigkeit. Wenn die Konzentration wieder abfällt kann es sein dass man mit Hirnschäden und amputationen überlebt.
Und man hat immer die Situation dass man einen Raum braucht in dessen nebenräumen niemand anders ist - auch nicht über oder unter einem weil man die sonst gefährdet. Idealerweise geht es nur in einer abgeschiedenen einsamen Hütte die man erstmal haben muss oder ein luftdicht/gasdicht abgeschottetes Zelt für das man in der derzeitigen Lage Probleme bekommt wenn man es aufstellt und draußen grillt .

Also mit exit bag ist es einfach alles viel genauer messbar und ich denke, dass wenn ich mich an alles halte was dafür wichtig ist auch klappen sollte.
Auch muss ich nicht vor der Durchführung noch reisen und Aufwand mit Grill veranstalten. Ich bereite vorher alles so vor und bin mit allem dann so vertraut dass ich es jederzeit hervorholen und umsetzen kann es ich meine dass der richtige Zeitpunkt gekommen ist.



P.s.: wenn ich beim exit bag auf Reinheit und die richtige Menge und den richtigen Flow achte, wofür ich den regulator habe der mir das anzeigt, dann frage ich mich was überhaupt noch schief gehen kann?

-Unbewusst die Tüte wegziehen
-Tüte platzt
-Es war doch nicht genügend gas in der gasflasche

Denke man kann die Gefahr dafür vorher minimieren.

These reasons sit on top of each other making the case insurmountable . I'm just touching in some things here but I could write a book 1000 pages to fully explain

1.There are many very horrible things that can happen to any human any day . Every sentient animal is under threat of extreme torture

2. On top of that there is no reason to live anyway . Life is meaningless

3. The labor and daily suffering are not Worth it and again there is no reason to work so hard just to accept suffering and risk extreme suffering.

4. Old age is beyond horrible . I worked in a nursing home

5 . Pain is a lot worse than people think . No reason to risk unending constant excruciating unbearable pain

6. They made this more of a prison world by making nembutal , someone helping in suicide etc crimes

7. Life is prison torture slavery and imposition. No one asked to be here and no one can leave when they want to in a guaranteed quick inexpensive painless way , so this is a prison

8. A human is just cells, a machine.

9. The human body is an abomination. A brain that can suffer unending constant unbearable pain: this is what they constantly tell us is so important, good , beautiful, pleasurable. 30 trillion cells that are really each just practically copies of a cell that evolved billions of years ago",,,,,,,,,,,,

Opioid Megathread & Overview,2216485,Rhizomorph1,"Oct 30, 2023 at 1:14 AM","Preamble

I wanted to write something similar to Stan's guide to SN but I hesitate to call this a guide because I can't in good conscience make a guide for something so unreliable in terms of access, lethality, and risk of permanent injury. I.e., traumatic brain injury from hypoxia. SN is a far more reliable and lower-risk alternative in this regard.

Indeed, the PPH strongly recommends against opioids for these reasons.

However, many will still seek to ctb using opioids due to reasons of accessibility, their notoriety for taking lives in the current overdose epidemic, and/or their well-known status as euphoriants and painkillers. The PPH does not go into details about how to ctb with opioids and overlooks different routes of administration and available drug checking services that can inform people on what is in their drugs.

The major benefit of opioids is that if successfully performed, death will be guaranteed to be peaceful, and perhaps even enjoyable for some. At face-value opioids would seem like an attractive method for this reason alone. But, I encourage spending some time forming an unbiased/neutral assessment of both the risks and benefits of this method, before making a decision.

The goal of this thread is twofold:
Help some to reconsider this method due to its poor reliability and risks of permanent injury/disability.
Provide information to improve reliability and minimize risk for permanent injury/disability for those who choose this method anyways.
**Even following the methods in this thread, opioid poisoning remains very unreliable due to variability in personal tolerance and uncontrollable factors related to drug quality.

Introduction

This thread is dedicated to compiling and discussing information on the method of opioid poisoning. Please feel free to comment with any additional information or recommended edits/criticisms to this post.

What are Opioids?

Opioids are analgesic (pain-relieving) drugs that, in high enough doses, result in death via respiratory depression. Examples include morphine, heroin, fentanyl, oxycodone (AKA Percocet or Oxycontin), hydrocodone, hydromorphone (AKA Dilaudid), codeine (AKA T3s), tramadol, and many others.

Pros and Cons

Pros
Nearly guaranteed to be peaceful, if successful
Accessible for people with pre-existing sources/dealers
Non-violent
Can easily be portrayed as ""accidental"", especially if one already uses drugs
Cons
Low to moderate reliability
Risk of permanent damage; traumatic injury, organ failure, etc.
Non-accessible for people without pre-existing sources/dealers or access to dark net
Reduced reliability for people with tolerance to opioids (e.g., from pre-existing opioid use)
Unpredictable: significant variance in effects from person to person (genetic/etc.-related tolerance & sensitivity)

How Do Opioids Work to Induce Death? What Does it Feel Like?

Opioid drugs bind to the opioid receptors in the brain which are the brain's primary pain-killing receptors. At high enough doses, this causes the nervous system to become depressed to a point where the brain stops sending signals to the lungs to breathe. This results in hypoxic death from lack of oxygenated blood to the brain and body. By the time of fatal respiratory depression, the person's brain will have been flooded with pain-killing signals and will also be completely unconscious (likened to a state of general anaesthesia); they will not experience any suffering.

Prior to losing consciousness, opioids can cause feelings of contentment, relaxation, euphoria, a warm and pleasurable feeling in the body, and has generally been described as being cozied up in a blanket beside a fire. Many people experience a cold flush and/or nausea and vomiting, especially their first time using opioids. Vomiting is not an issue for the effectiveness of ctb if the opioids were not consumed orally, but may be uncomfortable for some. Notably, the pleasurable opioid effects often make people indifferent to nausea. In some cases, intravenous injection may result in such rapid onset of effects that blackout occurs almost immediately, bypassing the pleasurable effects.

Which Opioids are Considered Best For CTB?

In short, heroin or fentanyl are ideal.

Stronger opioids such as heroin, fentanyl, or oxycodone are generally preferable as other types of opioids require much larger doses and thus have higher risk of failure. For example, heroin is about 10x as strong as morphine.

Pharmaceutical-grade opioids might be considered preferable by some given that their dosages are accurately labelled and they are not potentially contaminated or sold as different drugs entirely like with illegal markets. However, many pharmaceutical opioids also contain high concentrations of anti-inflammatory drugs such as paracetamol, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen (e.g., Percocet) that are likely to cause significant stomach pain and damage organs in the doses required to ctb. They also often contain fillers (e.g., Oxycontin) that make them unsuitable for injection or other routes of administration. Eating these medications is also not recommended as it is very likely to fail due to vomiting and oral bioavailability is low.

I highly recommend against using weak opioids like codeine, tramadol, or hydromorphone (dilaudid) as they are far too weak to reliably ctb.

I also recommend against research chemical opioids as too little is known about them to reliably ctb and the risk for pain, adverse effects, etc. is high.

Where Can I Get Opioids?

As mentioned above, some people get them by prescription, but most people will opt for heroin or fentanyl which are rarely prescribed. Illicit opioids can be found by contacting a dealer on the street or sourcing them via the dark net. See: How to Access Dark Net Markets for Ctb Resources or download tor browser and look up the Dark Net Market Buyer's Bible which you can find a .onion link for on the https://tor.taxi/ directory (.onion links in this directory can only be accessed using the tor browser).

Street drugs may be more accessible for some, but tend to be much more contaminated with other drugs and have significant variability in concentrations. Fentanyl, for example, tends to vary from around 5-25% concentration in a given sample. It is often cut with caffeine, benzodiazepines, cocaine, heroin, paint thinners, even concrete, and a range of other drugs. This webpage shows data on common cuts and buffs in the opioid supply, demonstrating how unreliable quality sourcing is off the street.

Dark net markets tend to have higher quality drugs due to their review system which adds some (but far from perfect) level of accountability. The gold star method would involve sourcing from a vendor with a long track record of positive reviews combined with utilizing drug-checking services (see below). China white #4 heroin is advisable.

The Importance of Checking Your Drugs

Because the drug supply on the street and dark net markets are heavily contaminated and inconsistently dosed, it is important to get your drugs checked using harm reduction services such as Energy Control (EU; possibly worldwide) or Get Your Drugs Tested (Canada) to determine approximate concentrations, to confirm the presence of your expected opioid, and to rule out the presence of other drugs. Some jurisdictions have local services where you can get your drugs checked legally, anonymously, and confidentially in-person.

*Energy Control has confirmatory chromatography testing meaning they can tell you more precise information without the limitations below. They should be able to tell you the exact concentration. Try to figure out if the service you use utilizes confirmatory/chromatography testing or an FTIR machine.

*Important: The FTIR spectroscopy technology used by Get Your Drugs Tested and many similar organizations has some limitations:
It can only detect concentrations within a margin of error that is around 10%. I.e., Results will usually say, for example ""between 40-50% heroin"". Some organizations prefer not to share concentrations unless explicitly asked.
It can only detect the presence of drugs that are above 5% concentration within the sample. There could be multiple other drugs present in a given sample below the 5% detection limit.
The ""chocolate chip cookie effect"": it can only detect what is in the portion of the sample you send them; just like in a cookie if you break off a chunk, there may or may not be chocolate chips in the chunk. Some drugs tend to clump together and won't be present in the ""chunk"" you send for testing. Grinding your sample to ensure it is a homogeneous mixture before mailing a portion may reduce this risk.
Fentanyl test strips can also be accessed online and via many pharmacies. However, they will only detect the presence of fentanyl and provide no information on concentrations. Plenty of fentanyl samples are massively under-dosed so fentanyl test strips alone are insufficient.

The Method

Now that you have sourced your opioid of choice, determined its relative concentration and ruled out the presence of other drugs, you need to ensure the right amount enters your body the right way.

Dose

A lethal dose of heroin for a person without any tolerance is technically 30mg. For fentanyl, it is considered 3mg. However, it is unlikely your sample will be 100% pure or even close to it. These doses are also on the lower end of the spectrum and will only be lethal in a proportion of people. A more conservative/reliable aim is at least 150mg for heroin and 15mg for fentanyl.

You will need to do some math based on the relative concentrations provided by the drug checking services you accessed previously. If you have a gram (1,000mg) of powder with a concentration/purity of 10-20% fentanyl, this means there is between 100-200mg of fentanyl in the gram of powder.

Here's an example of the math for a 500mg sample that has a concentration of 30-40% heroin:

500mg x 0.3 (30%) = 150
500mg x 0.4 (40%) = 200

Therefore, 500mg of 30-40% heroin will contain between 150-200mg of heroin. It is recommended to dose conservatively to ensure that the lower end of the range includes the lethal dose.

If you have any tolerance to opioids, this will also reduce the method's reliability further as you will have to do some guesswork to increase your dose accordingly. Erring on the side of caution by taking a larger dose will improve reliability.

Regarding Polydrug Poisoning & Potentiation

Some may wish to combine their opioid with other depressants which can potentiate the effects of opioids, making them more lethal. This is not necessary if you have a large enough dose of opioids but doesn't hurt to improve reliability or if the dose of opioids itself is too small to ctb on its own. The drugs below potentiate the effects of opioids meaning each individual drug has its own effect, but there is an additional effect due to the interaction between these drugs (almost like a 3rd effect on top of the individual effects of the 2 drugs). Potentiation will make the opioid more lethal by causing respitatory failure with a lower dose.

*Important: Although potentiating small doses of opioids with depressants will increase its reliability, it is still very unreliable compared to just using a high dose of opioids. Ideally one would use a sufficiently large dose of opioids in the first place and the addition of sedatives will only be included as a fail-safe.

Potentiating drugs that can be included are below:

- Benzodiazepines (e.g., Xanax (alprazolam), Klonopin (clonazepam), etizolam, Ativan (lorazepam), Valium (diazepam), etc. Benzodiazepines are drugs that reduce anxiety and cause sedation and relaxation. The combination has become increasingly associated with overdose deaths as dealers are cutting the fentanyl supply with benzodiazepines to make them feel stronger. The current supply of fentanyl in Canada witnesses around half of samples containing benzodiazepines. Check your drugs with the services above so you know whether yours contains benzodiazepines.

- Alcohol

- Z-drugs such as zolpidem (ambien) or zopiclone. Z-drugs are commonly prescribed for insomnia/as sleeping pills.

Route of administration (ROA)

The two ideal ROAs are intravenous injection and rectal administration. Other options are less ideal for the reasons described below.

Injections are preferable for anyone who has experience using needles or those willing to learn. Just make sure you draw visible blood into the syringe before pushing the plunger down, and don't hit an artery. Use sterile needles. 30-31 gauge syringes are provided no-questions-asked at most pharmacies or can be obtained online. More detailed instructions on preparing your shot can be found with a quick google search. I recommend following all harm reduction protocols (except ""start low, go slow - for obvious reasons) such as sanitary procedure, in case of ctb failure or abort. I know the risk may seem trivial, but you don't want to fail ctb only to be hospitalized and in pain due to a serious blood infection.

Rectal administration is the second most effective method as it has high bioavailability and is suitable for those who wish to skip the stress (or potential phobia) of needles. All you need is a small oral syringe, some water, and some lube for your bum hole. It is marginally less reliable as absorption will be slightly slower. This guide is great for detailing how to do it.

*Note: regarding the homophobia/stigma of men penetrating their butts with a syringe, it does make you gay. That's the best part! Jokes aside, straight men all over the world insert things in their butts to consume drugs (recreational, suppositories, to die), and sexual pleasure. There would be a lot less of us on this forum if not for homophobia… Show your support for us queer folk by dying with heroin up your arse <3

Oral administration is not suitable as it has a low bioavailability and vomiting is incredibly likely. Anti-emetics can be used, but this ROA is still inadvisable due to slow absorption/poor bioavailability. Snorting is also not recommended as absorption can be slow and is effected by the amount of powder in your nostrils; the more powder, the slower the absorption. It is also less bioavailable than injection or rectal administration.

Regarding Naloxone/Suicide Reversal

I feel compelled to advise people on how naloxone works in case anyone should want it by their side. Although most of us aim to ctb without potential for hesitation or reversal, cases where people will consume their lethal dose by whatever means and regret it or contact help are not out of the question.

Should you wish to have a means of reversal (up until the point where you cannot move your body or notify others for help; this will occur very quickly in most cases), naloxone is an effective reversal agent. Naloxone kits usually come with 3 vials and 3 syringes. You may wish to prepare the naloxone by drawing it into the syringes in advance in case you change your mind last minute. There is nothing wrong with changing your mind.

*Injection use of opioids will provide less/potentially no opportunity for reversal as the onset is so quick one may blackout immediately. Rectal administration will take place in approximately 5 minutes after adminstration.

You should dose yourself with at least 2 or more doses as you will have taken a dose that is likely considerably larger than what most people overdose on. If comfortable, contact emergency services after dosing the naloxone as it has a short half-life and when it wears off the opioid effects can cause you to collapse and die later on. If you aren't comfortable contacting emergency services, consider getting 2 or more naloxone kits so you can dose yourself repeatedly until certain the opioid effects have worn off.

Naloxone works by kicking the opioid off your brain's opioid receptor. You can access naloxone kits legally and confidentially at most local pharmacies. It is relatively intuitive to use and will not harm you in any way; it has virtually no interactions with other drugs. You will feel sober afterwards and that is about it.

A research chemical could have very low efficacy (e.g., codeine) due to a combination of factors (low lipid solubility/absorption, high rate of metabolism, low binding affinity at opioid subreceptors), or it could have very high efficacy like fentanyl or heroin. Individual variance in tolerance or response to the drug is also unknown.

Other factors like binding affinity for non-opioid receptors, toxicity to non-vital organs, or effects on other biological systems will be unknown, meaning death could be slow, painful, or involve various complications.

I wouldn't recommend research chemicals given the substantial number of unknown factors. Accessibility is the *only* benefit for those who have a clear-net source.
The difference depends on what is contained in the street fentanyl. I can't really say because street fentanyl varies so dramatically, with some samples even containing no fentanyl whatsoever or containing completely different psychoactive drugs (probably less than 5% or so of the so-called ""fentanyl"" supply, but it still shows how inconsistent it is). Street fentanyl is not regulated and thus could be any combination of drugs with any effects.

This is why getting your drugs checked and doing the math based on the concentration provided by drug-checking services is important; to ensure you consume the same approximate quantity of fentanyl.

Two drugs commonly included in street fentanyl are caffeine and ascorbic acid (vitamin C) because they can help with dissolving and injecting the drug. They shouldn't have a profound impact. Things like erythritol, mannitol, or inositol are inert sugars that are safe and won't have any effect. However, the more of these ""buffs"" present, the less opioid will be present concentration-wise, which also signals the need to check your drugs.

1 mg of street fentanyl = 1mg of medical fentanyl. It's all the other stuff in street fentanyl that varies substantially that will make the difference in terms of ctb efficacy, adverse effects, drug interactions, etc.",2226793,2228072,,,,,,,,,,

Opioid Megathread & Overview,2231760,Rhizomorph1,"Nov 9, 2023 at 6:49 PM","The issue with intranasal is that the more powder you insufflate, the slower the absorption will be because of a few factors:
1. powder ""clogging"" up the nose
2. powder drying up the mucous membranes (moisture facilitates absorption)
3. irritation to the sinuses causing inflammation which can ""push"" the powder away from the mucous membranes

The other issue that corresponds to point #3 is that depending on how one snorts the power (snorting ""hard"" vs. ""soft"", with a straw/without, etc.) will affect where the drug is deposited in the nose. The mucous membranes are a specific distance from the nostrils and depositing it too far up will lead it to drip down the throat, which is not only unpleasant but will further reduce the bioavailability and absorption speed as it will now be consumed orally. Likewise, depositing too close to the nostril openings will have essentially no effect as it won't get absorbed.

In small doses it can be reliable for achieving psychoative effects (the ""high""), but in larger doses - especially those needed to ctb - the reduced bioavailabiltiy compared to injection or rectal use combined with the variable/exponentially reduced absorption (based on the factors above) make snorting less than ideal.

It's not impossible, but I don't recommend snorting as it will further reduce the reliability within an already unreliable method.",2230223,,,,,,,,,,,

Opioid Megathread & Overview,2239012,Rhizomorph1,"Nov 14, 2023 at 5:53 PM","I'm not sure what -zene opioids are. Are you confusing opioids with benzodiazepines? They are two very different drugs.

I think the time before death is likely to vary by the amount of opioids consumed and individual factors. Some people may be more sensitive or resistant to the respiratory depressive effects vs. others at the same dose. Speaking theoretically, a small dose or slow absorption could depress breathing to a point of slow interspersed breaths where there is insufficient oxygen to avoid damage but sufficient to sustain life. The ""size"" of the dosage window for this to occur may vary by person. If this were to happen my guess is a person could die very slowly, or simply recover with brain damage. This is why it is important to dose conservatively and taking a dose well above the minimum lethal amount or lethal median dose (LD50; the dose at which 50% of people will die)

I'm not a doctor though and don't know the precise relationship between opioid effects on breathing. I'm entirely making an educated guess.

A larger dose that is absorbed more quickly is more likely to completely depress breathing in which case most people can only survive a few minutes without oxygen. There are plenty of people who get revived by naloxone well after the time it would usually take to suffocate under other conditions indicating it probably varies.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7732170/ this literature review doesn't provide more concrete data but does say that death occurred quickly for most overdoses.

My best guess is it will vary by the person's tolerance to opioids, individual response to the opioid's respiratory depressing effects, the dose of opioids taken, purity of opioids, the half life of the opioid drug in question, and many other factors. It could take minutes or it could take hours.

Checking your drugs, dosing accordingly, and being mindful about personal tolerances to opioids may help improve reliability but unfortunately there are a lot of unpredictable possibilities with this method.

A high enough dosage taken via injection or rectally while in a location where one will not be found or resuscitated will almost certainly result in death.

The question is whether the dose is high enough for the person and whether they know the purity of their drug(s).

Thankfully because IV and rectal ROAs don't carry the risk of failure from vomiting associated with larger doses, one can always take a larger dose to improve (but probably not ensure) the reliability of this method.",2238944,,,,,,,,,,,

Opioids will show up in a toxicology report. It could look unintentional for a few reasons:

- a person could be drug-naive and be unfamiliar with dosage or suspect that the drug is a different drug altogether. One could try to leave behind other subtle ""evidence"" that they were experimenting with recreational drugs (e.g., some cannabis or baggies of cocaine; whatever fits the bill for the circumstances they want to construct). It's not perfect but it may leave people uncertain at least.

- drugs like fentanyl often contain around 5-25% fentanyl but occasionally samples come around that are 90%+ pure fentanyl. As long as there is none of the physical sample left behind then the toxicology reports won't show the concentration of the fentanyl in the sample, but only how much actually got into one's system. For someone who already uses opioids it would be reasonable to believe they just had a really strong batch (even if they actually just took a significantly larger dose of a weaker batch)

It would probably require some careful planning to make it appear accidental and would leave authorities/family members potentially questioning whether it was intentional or not. Making it appear accidental is probably more effective for people who are already known to use opioids.
Stan's Guide to SN covers the SN method and discusses how peaceful/painful it might be. It seems fairly peaceful, with headaches, nausea, tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), and some mild sweating or anxiety being the bulk of uncomfortable effects that usually only last around 10-20 minutes before losing consciousness. If curious go ask some questions there :)

For fentanyl or heroin the best bet is to access the dark net (see my OP for resources to access the dark net). As I mentioned, use a drug checking service to verify how much fentanyl/heroin are actually in a sample you purchase.

I would recommend SN over opioids for its reliability alone.

Only 100% carbon charcoal should be used and lump charcoal is best. A car can be tricky to use, as there are many points of leakage that need to be sealed. Charcoals need to be lit outside the vehicle and allowed to burn until all are glowing red hot and emitting no smoke. Then they are moved into the car, set on some bricks so as not to start a fire, and the CO is allowed to build up for a time. Usually, charcoals are started in chimney starters and then transferred to metal buckets. A small grill can also be used.

A CO analyzer is a device that measures the CO concentration within a given volume of air. In order to fall unconscious quickly, it is recommended that the CO concentration be 1%, or a minimum of 10000 PPM (parts per million). You need an analyzer capable of measuring up to 10000 PPM. They run about $300 US.

In order to know for certain if the amount of charcoal used is enough to get the level of CO to 10000 PPM in (your) car, it may require several ""dry runs"" and monitoring with the analyzer, and then make adjustments accordingly (more charcoal, better sealing). You may also have to adapt your lighting/burning technique to make sure all the coals burn properly - ALL coals glowing red hot, no smoke.",,,,,,,,,,,,

What’s your method? (poll),2660949,sugarb,"Sep 6, 2024 at 10:31 PM","Yep, followed distantly by hanging and drug OD. Definitely a bit different than I'd expected.

Statistically guns have the most success per capita followed by drowning and hanging, and guns make up about 50% of all suicides, so it's interesting to see that guns are fairly unpopular while hanging is second place to SN on here. I imagine it's due to this site being a different demographic with more information about various methods.

Potentially it's because guns (and drowning, which is extremely lethal) aren't used in most attempts despite being overrepresented in successes. However I doubt that being the main cause for the results here as SN is plenty lethal and those ODing on drugs most likely are choosing ones that won't necessitate switching to another method after a failed attempt.

Speaking of, I possibly should've split drug OD into categories. Prescription drugs, euthanasia drugs, and illicit drugs (fent, etc) are pretty distinct.

I'd be curious to see what the most common method is for the people on here who actually succeeded in CTBing, but that'd be more difficult data to get as they can't vote. Would take trawling through a bunch of posts.",2660788,,,,,,,,,,,

i cherish my friends and i make sure that they all know how much i love them, but i feel so lonely all of the time. i've posted about it a lot, but i just feel so worthless and alone because i'm not really anybody's favorite person. i don't feel important to anyone unless i am the MOST important person to them. i constantly need attention and validation, it's honestly ridiculous. the way i feel is really selfish so i don't really bother anyone about it. i feel very guilty and that i don't deserve the people in my life, so i don't bug my friends with these thoughts. i just cry about it on this forum lolol.

If you've no experience with camping, maybe you don't know, but camping can be done outside of designated campgrounds. Some countries, places, it'll be more limited but check it out and if you can perhaps aim for ""dispersed camping,"" or don't even bother calling it camping; just hit a public dirt road and pull off far away.

Anyone with camping experience,2660906,AliceTheGoon,"Sep 6, 2024 at 9:48 PM","I did something like this when I first became afflicted with my degenerative condition. There was a parking lot off the highway in the mountains with a campsite set a little way back from the parking area. I backed my car into the campsite so I could view the parking area while I tried to work up the nerve to shoot myself. I put my sunshield up so people couldn't see me and sat there for several hours. Finally I got hungry and went home.

I tried again and brought snacks and water. My gun has a full lug barrel which makes it awkward to get into the mouth so I kept sipping water to make it easier. As a result I also had to get out of the car often to pee. Vehicles kept coming and going and I was afraid I was arousing suspicion and cops might be called. It wasn't camping weather either, there was snow on the ground. I had a suicide note with me as well as a note at home so if my belongings were searched the jig would be up. I think I sat in that spot for about six hours, maybe more. At one point a couple was having a cookout in the parking lot and the guy walked toward my car, apparently to pee in the woods nearby. I don't think he knew I was there but I hopped out so he wouldn't look in my car and spot the gun. He was kind of startled and then I was spooked so I left shortly after that.

I thought the same thing about who might find me and the inconvenience of the local police having to deal with my body since I lived far away. And then what would they do with my body, would someone have to drive up there and ID me? Also my note had my address on it, someone could steal my car and go ransack my home. I realized that I can't plan my death like that, if it's going to happen it will have to be spontaneous.",,,,,,,,,,,,
DDMA and SN combo method,2660902,PhDone,"Sep 6, 2024 at 9:45 PM","Saw someone mention in a thread discussing how many pills would be needed for DDMA, D-DMA or DDMPh that there was little chance of getting it all down without vomiting. They briefly mentioned using SN too to reduce the pill count. So what would this look like?

- still the AE and fasting leading up to lethal intakes
- small dose of digoxin pre 30mins? This is one of the drugs needing the highest pill count, so is it of any value to take it with much lower dose?
- Propranolol pre? PPH currently recommends taking propranolol at same time as SN. But most protocols on here say pre to allow for time to max effect. P is also not part of the DDMA/Ph protocol, so would there be value? Interference?
- Benzo in the DDMA is with the mixture, theres bee much discussion on here taking it prior, I had been thinking a small amount 5-10mins pre would be about the right timing (avoiding passing out before lethal dosing if take eg 30mins out)
- this leaves SN, M and A at same time. Again A requires a lot of pills, so value in taking much less? Possible interference?

I guess overall challenge is replacing the stomach dealing with lots of pills to now dealing with 'half' the pills but SN too. Maybe overall it just leads back to the same place?

I had thought M could be a replacement for ibuprofen as recommended in SN protocol. Maybe then its just missing digoxin out?

Anyway, keen for discussion.
Thanks all.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Jumping From Height (Guide),865826,Xiaomi,"Sep 11, 2020 at 1:01 AM","I shall jump to my death 4 months from now and am warming myself up. Just want to share what I've learned if some of you plan to use this method.

Pros:
+ If done correctly, spinal cord will be severed or brain will be destroyed on impact resulting in a peaceful death
+ Requires nothing and is a ""free"" method, anyone can do it
+ Chance of survival is extremely slim. In rare cases people ended up vegetables but still passed away

Cons:
- Accidentally hitting someone (avoid this by surveying the surroundings or choosing a less busier time)
- A closed casket funeral
- Public death (chances are you'll end up on social media and some bystanders might be traumatized so location is important); but who gives a shit anyway
- Police might interfere if you hesitate, turning it into a hostage situation

Tips:
× In order to combat SI, numb yourself with sleeping pills/drowsy meds
× Position yourself to land on your back or head
× Count to 3, Jump on 2. Fool your SI.
× According to the wiki, alcohol beforehand is not advisable since it relaxes the muscles. Relaxed muscles protect internal organs
× Fifty percent of people who fall four to five stories die. By the time you reach 10 or 11 stories, just about everyone dies
× From a height of 30m there is a 90% probability of death
× Practice jumping in your pool or a trampoline
× Optimal Height is 100m over concrete, 200m over water

Best Locations:
Golden Gate (98% of jumpers die)
Beachy Head
A 10th floor balcony or fire exit
Some carpark
Yangtze River Bridge
Cairo Tower
Your workplace (if fed up with employer)
The Gap, Australia
A volcano, I've seen some craters without barriers installed

CRAZY ALTERNATIVES:
$ Plan a balloon ride, then jump off as you reach the top
$ Plan a solo skydive (requires a license), then ""forget"" to activate your chute
$ Drive your car off a cliff
$ For student pilots, you may try to jump off your trainer plane during your solo flight (yes, someone succeeded using this method)

I shall add more stuff after I've researched more.

Jumping From Height (Guide),2536568,Onelegman,"May 26, 2024 at 6:26 AM","My question is, if sitting at the window, I threw myself backwards into the void, would inertia make me spin like a top? On my first try I jumped and landed on my feet, I imagine it like a plummeting needle.

This time I want to fall on my head or on my back to suffer as much damage as possible and have no option to save myself, but I don't understand physics and I think that when I fall on my back, my lower back acts. like, say, a roulette and I start to spin slowly as I fall. I don't want to look when I do it and therefore I can't make sure I go head first. Any advice?

I think the biggest weight would be on my torso and I would fall on my back, but I can't practice something like that, not at high altitudes, of course.

Here in Spain many travelers make balconies, jump from terraces to fall into pools, but the view deceives them and what they see as 2 meters from the railing to the water is actually 5/7 meters away, so they cannot move forward. no matter how much they think and end up killing each other against the sidewalk-

If you have the opportunity, measure the distance from the edge of the building to the water of the pool, you will notice that, even running, you would have a hard time reaching the water. Does that help you?",1973522,,,,,,,,,,,

Jumping From Height (Guide),2537724,black and white,"May 27, 2024 at 8:21 AM","Beautiful movie, i answer because this is the movie i watch a lot to ctb. Discovered it when it came out, and it was hard to watch as this time as i was in a sad mood already. But those days its just pure beauty and deep emotions to watch it.

Anyway to answer the question, this is a fictionnal movie, don't expect it to be realistic enough about suicide (even if ogaki city is well represented, and all those places exists in reality). First we're not really sure which floor, the nishimiya family is leaving, we never seen it precisely in the movie nor in the book. Considering the moment Shoya is falling is the only moment we can have an idea of the height and it seems to be a minimum of 7 floors. Then yes he fall into the water, but then remember the river is not very deep in the city, sometimes they are in the river and the water is around their knees... So considering shoya is falling head first, the supposed minimal height of 20 meters/65 feets, even maybe more it's already a little miracle he surivived without real injuries (in the book it is said he suffered from soulders and butt but not much, nothing more). Normaly in reality the chance of surival were very very small.

So to answer more precisely your question: a jump from the tenth floor (close or over 30 meters) on concrete is a sure death with a very high ratio of 99%. In water it's very difficult to say, depending the way you fall, and the deepness of the water. Because if it's not that deep you can hit the bottom of the pool. This scenario is much more difficult to evaluate, chances of death can really decrease yes, because the water can absorb a part of the impact; but this won't be a little funny jump either, even if you survive, you could be injured seriously both physically and mentally. The best way would be to target concrete, within the tenth floors, death is assured close to 100% no matter how you fall.

I'm on that direction myself. But it's not as easy and romantic as in the movie. The survival instinct is huge, vertigos too. This is probably one of the fastest and radical way to die, with no real chance of survival, just few seconds of free fall and instantaneous death without any pain. Still recquire lots of courage, will and determination to make it.
I live at the 8th floor, about 20 meters/65feet, so the minimum but already enough to have not much chance of survival (even if you're in coma, the window for medical assistance should be quite short, planning to do it at 3-4 o'clock when everyone sleeping, i'm quite sure to die). quote from a doctor ""after the 7th it's a one way ticket with certainty"". Several times i already did put myself on the other side of the balcony (balcony on the back side, so no one seen it at this hour) and been catched up by the fear of it. I even tried different form of hypnosis to calm down the thing, but still at the same point actually. Thing is i'm running out of time, I am so sure of my decision and still conscious about the difficulty to realise it that i did put myself into a no-way-out situation and blocked into this thing that can't continue any longer.

So as always the main problem isn't really about water or not. Concrete would be better, water from a pool could really increase chance of survival. So yes to be sure to die, concrete from 10th floor is one of the quickest and surest way. But way before this result, believe me the hardest part is to do it. I'm surprised so much people succeed to do it at any moment on earth, when it's actually very difficult to really make the step.",1973522,,,,,,,,,,,
Jumping From Height (Guide),2537988,Onelegman,"May 27, 2024 at 1:14 PM","I completely agree, you can psych yourself up every minute of every day and still have doubts and fear despite being convinced that you want to do it. And I already did it once... but it was quick and without thinking.

I had planned to do it well before my family returned from vacation, they were going to notify me when they entered the autonomous community, but they forgot and I found myself in the situation of hearing the elevator, their voices... and while the lock was opening, without Thinking of nothing, I put one foot on the chair, another on the railing, and then I was already stepping on air.

I find myself in a very similar situation to you, I have already chosen the day June 6 and the time, like you, 4-5 a.m. One day before my mother returns from a trip (I can't bear the thought of putting her through something so horrifying again) I will do it in an interior patio, where I can't fall on anyone and nothing will stop me, only the air conditioning. It's a bit of a challenge for me because I have a broad shoulder and I'm afraid of bumping into it and diverting the trajectory. My idea is to do it on my back, (I think I already said it) and let myself fall backwards with my leg straight. And even knowing that it won't hurt, imagining that I don't fall correctly again makes me go crazy.

As much as I would like to do it upside down, I don't have the courage, even if I close my eyes, I am convinced that I wouldn't fall straight, I would notice how I twist in the air when I fell and it makes me nauseous. Although it would be ideal. The helplessness is indescribable.

Congratulations for having the courage to go out to the other side of the railing, aren't your legs shaking? Yesterday I tried to climb on the furniture to calculate how high my ass would be on the windowsill and my whole body was shaking. Unfortunately I have no option to go further, one night when I have privacy I will try again with the blinds down and getting as close as possible, but the window frame is thick and I am clear that holding on to the wall with my leg will be very difficult. . If I fall plummeting when I sit down, goodbye calculations, inertia is very treacherous...

The ""only"" thing that reassures me is the absence of pain even if I don't fall on my head and that the injuries could make me pass out from blood loss relatively quickly. The other time I was conscious until the ambulance induced a coma, it is a disgusting feeling to see people milling around you, see their faces, hear their expressions and not be able to avoid it.

So... here we are, wanting to finish and with instincts on the surface. I'm lucky enough to be able to take the sleeping pills and hopefully they'll help me not think too much before making the final decision, but it's still so scary...

Last night, my legs began to shake, i came back on the balcony and felt panicked, and pathetic same time as you can imagine to not find the courage when i am sure of my decision. Honnestly i don't know how japanese samurais did find the courage to do seppuku, those guys were very brave... Probably because of the cuture and the way they have been educated, i don't know.

I have some pills to relax and decrease anguish a doctor gave me three months back, i'm planning to try take some tonight, see if it could help (i tried different form of meditation and hypnosis to calm down the fear since several weeks but it brings nothing). I think the only solution is to execute it the most straight possible. I really have the feeling that the most you try, the more you're afraid. Maybe this is the way our subconscious counter-attack our growing feeling/decision of making it.

I'm quite surprised you already did in the past and not fall in coma naturally. What was the actual height for you survived this (no morbid curiosity, just trying to understand)??? I did prepare a little paper in my pocket with my ID indicating i don't want any medical help but i know they won't care and do it anyway, if they can. I know the height is not much in my case but it's already considered as the minimum for a certain death. Considering the hour i wanna do it, and the way, the backyard is not easy to access, makes me confident that the rescue could lose some precious minute in the case i'm not dead already, and in coma. 8th floor is already serious from what i understand and if it's not instantaneous, it won't be long probably. Between 4th and 6th floors, the probabiblity of death increase rapidly but the way you fall (or impact actually) still is a factor. Normally up to 7th floor and over, chances of survival are very thin.

I try to not think that much about the fall itself or the after, or the possibility that i will survive (and in what condition). This is some kind of thinking that will just makes you crazy, makes you doubt. You will just feel bad, nauseus or whatever imagining all those possibilties. In your case i think the worst is that you're living with your family, it gave you less opportunities to do it; and bring you more thought about the after, the reaction of the others etc. So this make things even more complicated; but in fact it's kind of the same. The brain is always finding details, reasons to try discourage you to do it.
we're all in the sameboat, i'm confronting myself to it since weeks and that's clearly not easy. But yes, it's one of the most effective, fast and painless method, it's pretty radical. But the main problem still remains, Damn SI, so difficult to win against it...",2537988,2537994,,,,,,,,,,

The Japanese mentality is made of steel, I have also thought about it many times, that it wasn't just about pricking yourself, until they cut off your head they would pass on what is not written.

I wouldn't take any pills, well if you have a lot yes, and I would save them for THE day.

I live on a 7th floor, each floor is about 3 meters high, to this we must add approximately 20 cm between each floor, plus the portal, which at first glance can be 4 meters. Adding it all up: 24 meters with luck. I want to think that even with a good impact, the speed will make the head hit with enough force to knock me out... you have more possibilities, you have 1 floor more than me! bad joke

The notes are useless because the first thing they will think is that you have fallen, then things change, and as you say, they will try to help you. In which country are you? That minute between them answering the call and arriving at the inaccessible place will give us what we want, have faith.

Jumping From Height (Guide),2538245,black and white,"May 27, 2024 at 5:02 PM","We have approximatively the same height. you may have a bit more than me. Cause floors are not very thick here (2,7m from what i've calculated) and the side where i have to jump is a bit more high than the street itself. As i said, i stopped considering those details, i think the height is already pretty serious and sufficient. My main problem is SI.

I'm in France; as i said the time the rescue could arrive really depends on 1) someone actually realise what happened and call them, 2) their ability to access this backyard which is a bit complicated. That's why very late at night is the moment i choosed (and also to not be disturbed, to be alone, it's already enough scary, thinking someone could notice make it worse), i observed the last late sleeper goes around 3-4 o'clock depending the day, and this is approximatively the same hours that one or two others, can wake up, once again it depends the day. I just choosed the most peaceful time, to be as lonely as possible and increase the chances that nobody will notice, so some anticipation but not focusing too much on it because you never know, maybe it could take two hours before sun comes up and people notice or someone could call instantly, who knows, i can't be sure of that...

The other solution was the natural environment around the city which is full of little mountains, rocks everywhere, but you need time to go there etc so i find it much more easy and comfortable to do it from here: as it is much more simple to just go on the balcony and put myself in situation at night. Especially as the final step is hard to assume. Going every day doing a long trip outside the city to finally come back every time seems tiring.

So globally i'm quite confident about the result the main problem is to succeed overcome the fear of it. Even if i did put myself in an impossible situation recently and arriving now at a moment where my living situation is a dead end (no more money for example and bills accumulating), even if i'm pretty sure it's the best thing to do etc doesn't make it more easy on the final step. It was the plan at first, thinking this dead end situation will bring more strenght and will to act but it doesn't really change the mental state your SI is engaging to block you... pretty crazy.",2538205,,,,,,,,,,,

No more than alive

From my mouth (but still the screen is flickering)
I've spent too long (with an endless stream of garbage)
On the inside out (curse the place)
My skin is cold (in a sea of random images)
To the human touch (the self-destructing animal)
This bleeding heart's (waiting for the waves)
Not beating much (to break)

Of silence, and now
I don't even hear

Extinguished by light

Transgender Support Megathread,1968568,ArchmagePrincess,"Apr 23, 2023 at 7:52 PM","I don't think it's pathetic to be incredibly scared of openly being yourself. It's an incredibly difficult thing to do. You can lose friends and family, and get discriminated against and harassed for being openly trans. It's horrendous so many people see us as freaks just for wanting to be ourselves, and that pain is immense and never truly goes away.

As a trans person who has been out and transitioned for years now, I can say my experience has been a mixed bag. I've had some people be incredibly kind and accepting right off the bat and make me feel loved for who I was, and I've lost many people I thought would be with me for a long time and faced a lot of people's bullshit. Co-workers, family, and friends have been on either side of that. I don't regret transitioning or coming out one bit, but it has been hard. It's taken forever, but I can finally look at myself in the mirror and think I'm cute, something teenaged me would've never have thought possible.

Being openly trans demands a lot of strength from a person, who is already hurting and scared, and it's incredibly unfair. I still remember being a little kid just dreaming of becoming a princess and wanting to wear dresses and be seen as a sister and a daughter, and so so much pain has come from such an innocent wish.

I hope you are able to summon the strength to be yourself even if it's only right before your death.

I started hrt before I turned 20 and got a minor surgery last year but still feel like a man. I mean, I guess it's probably because I still get called sir and him every time someone in public addresses me so obviously strangers don't think I look like a woman. I really would prefer if I pass because I already have an anxiety disorder/ptsd which makes being around people hard initially and this issue of not passing makes me feel unsafe or like an easy target in public.

Even though I've been transitioning for years, I still get the idea that I don't register to others as a trans woman or a cis woman, but some weird, awkward, feminine, scarred-armed gay guy.

I fucking hate it like you wouldn't believe how people just trivialize the suffering of it as well. I know it's hard for people to conceptualize why it is so painful and depressing to feel like you're stuck in the wrong body but there's no need to talk like I'm some ""snow-flake"" or whatever stupid term like that. The same people who go around calling others snowflakes for wanting to be treated normally and not like a freak, will generally get super offended over things that are way easier to trivialize in my opinion.

Though at the same time I'm afraid of transition because I know I'll never pass, everytime I look in the mirror I realize no matter how much I try I'll just end up looking half done. What can I do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I have to come to terms with the fact I'll die like this. I have no friends, my parents hate queer people, I have nowhere to run to. This world hates people like me, if people found out what would they do?

between all of these things I guess it's just best to realize the fact that I'll die like this. Nobody will remember me as who I am, nobody will know me, nobody would even bother to find out more.

I can pass okay thanks to almost 2 years of HRT and my asian genes, yet I cannot help but wonder how things could have been if I had managed to be myself just 5 years earlier and prevented the worst damages from testosterone, or if I had loving parents. Maybe that I wouldn't have been so socially withdrawn and depressed, I envy people who lead a joyful life but I always have the feeling that it is something that is not intended for me. I just cannot picture myself being truly happy unless that I got a lobotomy, and even then whether I am actually happy or not would be debatable.

Although I know that I'll be dying soon, I am glad that I somehow survived my first retirement attempt (pre-HRT) and made it this far. I'm still going to be dead, but at least I can die as myself and look presentable while doing so. I do have to admit that I feel somewhat guilty about wanting to die given that my situation, while not ideal, is much better than what the majority of other trans people have to deal with.

Being a trans is ass,2611203,horrorvacui,"Jul 27, 2024 at 6:07 PM","Hello everyone,

I've always lurked a lot on this website out of sheer curiosity, often afraid to create an account and learn of everyone's mental strifes.

Being transgender (MtF, idk anymore I just like being pretty and fem even if people see me as a boy) has had it's terrible ups and downs. The first few months I started HRT back into 2020 became most enlightening and beautiful moments of my life. i had finally became the alternative girl that I always dreamed about envisioning myself as with each step of the way, trying new makeup styles, getting the clothes I wanted, all that good stuff. Life felt like it was finally on the right track for myself and what I envisioned my transition goals would look like

But being trans later down the line has brought an uncountable amount of mental struggles that I feel like I cannot overcome. BDD (Body Dysmorphia Disorder) and trans dysmorphia soon came into full effect and continue to ruin my life. I'm sick of seeing cute fem people that I look so cute, and I feel completely absent of any beauty that they withhold. People always talk about how beauty standards in the US and globally under a disguise of filters and face editing apps, but I've bumped into people in person who just look like they were completely ripped from TikTok or instagram.

This has made me not go out anymore, I think the remaining friends I have think I'm awkward, quiet, and uninteresting. It's gotten to the point where I can't dress up snd go out with makeup anymore and I can't stand to look at my disgusting face everytime I get a glance in the mirror. All I see is a fucking man, even if people think I had 'good luck' with being trans I don't believe them at all and think they are feeding me bullshit to make me feel better.

My life is so fucking unbearable that i can't NOT look at my face without having a panic attack, and just the thought of bringing a knife to my face just to cut off any dysphoric pieces of my face to make myself beautiful sounds so nice.

The idea if ctb always rings into my mind as well, the idea of being able to escape this world in the blink of the eye with no more consciousness is scary but serene sounding at the same time.

Idk if anyone else has the same experiences with being trans or having dysmorphia of rhe similar scope, but it'd be nice to hear people relate in a similar way. Idk, I'm a first timer here so i have no idea how to continue this.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the time when I look at myself in the mirror I simply impulsively try to look away and not recognise myself, leading me to dissociate from my physical body, calling it a ""meat armour"" and refering to myself as a ""brain"" to try to not think about my existence. Being trans is tough, it is for more than a reason and it's not easy. Maybe I can conclude saying that no one can dictate who you really are more than yourself, even if others don't ""agree"" they can't change who you are in case you'll doubt and feel insecure about yourself.

I honestly related so much to all of what you said (like everything, except switch genders).

I understand the feeling of dysphoria making you think you look like a monster. What I tell you, as that your thoughts are most likely wrong. People often see you very differently than what you think.

I've also considered CTB but one thing I've always told myself is ""Stay alive out of spite"". In the sense that people hate us for being trans and want us dead. So prove them wrong! Prove them wrong by being beautiful, by staying alive, by being the best you!

There has to be an unwritten rule that if you're female and promote your own social media account, then you are probably attractive by conventional standards. I mean, probably 90% to 95% of the girls I've seen with YouTube channels, who are there to do a bunch of different things -- educate us about how they deal with mental disorders like schizophrenia; tell us about the architecture of Old London; show us how women dressed in Victorian times by making and wearing clothes from that era; talking about physics; you name it -- they're all good looking. The other day, YouTube, for some reason, started showing me videos by a trans woman named Ashley, who goes by the screen name Icky, who's just flat pretty. (She's also smart, articulate, has a goofy sense of humor, and is entertaining.) She mainly talks about the process of transitioning.

Where do these girls come from? Maybe it's self-selection. Point being, don't judge yourself by the way other people look online.

2 choices (have both) but am struggling to decide how to proceed. I'm a non violent 40s small female.

1) SN - would have to go somewhere like a parking lot or abandoned cemetery during day. Live with my family so can't get hotel room or do it at home. Also have stomach lining irritation (not as bad as gastritis am on bland soft food diet). I'm chemically damaged already and failure with this could be extremely bad (increased sound sensitivity would be horrendous) and then no option for gun later. Would lose everything I have left if fail. Fear of pain and failure.

2) Revolver - I've dry fired the .357 a lot but have never shot gun. I hate this method as a nonviolent person. Have tried twice, going to abandoned cemetery, but can't seem to pull trigger. I was there 4 hours last time. The good: it's usually successful. It's quick and likely painless. The bad. It's violent and scary.

I need to go. I'm tortured, neurologically, mentally and physically in pain. It's hard because I had a beautiful life. I don't want to hurt my loved ones....it makes me cry thinking about it but life is hell. They are all starting to hate me too.

I'm confident if I jumped from a height I would regret it going down. That doesn't mean I don't want to die. I think its a very human thing to do. I cannot purchase any weapons since I have had several rubber sock vacations.

The irony was that our last photo together was at McDonald's, the irony being the clown.

Ok, but what am I trying to say here anyway?

Well, the suicide rate in the most developed countries seems to be the highest. Why? My theory rn is, that ppl always thought that life is a crude joke.

We live once, die, and while we have this one time ""opportunity"" to live, we make up stupid stories of eternal life after (!?) we die (lel), we just need to do this, and that, the toad told me, after I tortured it to get the 5-MeO-DMT which I need to smoke to kill the poison and just inhale the ""god molecule"".

At least I would take the synthetic version of this shit to not torture more animals as we do already with the animal industry, if I had the balls aka mental strength to do that.

And that's the problem with the developed countries. Fed up with ""Christ coming back any moment, don't you see the sings?"", atheism skyrocketing through the glass dome, which separates the ocean in the sky so we don't drown again. Next time it will be fire because it's the opposite of water, and for eternity as the opposite of an temporary flood.

But the bored, softened atheist has it very easy here to end his life earlier comfortably, at least in comparison to back then.

So, is this the problem or is my view just extremely narrow minded?

Is it rational to browse Sanctioned Suicide?,2540624,noname223,"May 29, 2024 at 1:41 PM","This question is similar to the question ""Is suicide rational?"" or ""Can suicide be rational?"". Hence I post it here in the suicide discussion sub-forum.

SaSu is a website full of people in extreme pain and existential suffering. When most people describe things that are good for their soul they say for example they spend time outside, seeing the sun shining, doing sports (which has an anti-depressive effect), playing games with their friends, watching a movie and stuff like that.

In contrast this forum is inter alia about killing oneself. Plans on how to do it. Explicit descriptions of abuse and neglect. People in extreme soulcrushing and never ending pain. It documents the lives and deaths of people who would have deserved a happy end but never received it.
So why are so many of us visiting this forum every single day? Is it simply an addiction of misery porn? Is it like a spirale one cannot get out of? The answer to this question probably depends on the individual.

Many so called ""suicide experts"" (by the media) say how damaging a community like this one was. However, as you can see in the wikipedia article of this forum the stance is way more heterogenous than in the articles about this forum. Actually there is not much research on forums like this one.

The question emerges whether we just enjoy self-destruction and hence we visit this forum. We might want to corner ourselves. This is just a hypothesis. It might apply to some people. I doubt this applies to the majority and certainly not on me. I just want start with some controversial statements. I am not sure whether my next points should be universal or applied to my individual case to deal with this forum. Maybe both.

I think most people come here for the methods. I think my motivation was finding methods at first (4 years ago). If you are chronically suicidal for a very long time the notion to commit suicide can be cathartic. Personally, I imagine every single day to commit suicide. It gives me the strength to go on wqith fighting. I am in a lot of pain. I feel cornered as fuck. And I really really hate that feeling. I am a control freak. I cannot stand to be with my back against the wall. Imagining suicide makes me calm. It makes it more endurable the feeling of being in so much pain with no end in sight..

Many people who have chronic suicidal thoughts will never commit suicide. Sometimes even the knowledge of being able to cease one's existence can make pain bearable. For many suicidal thoughts keep mostly passive and only sometimes acute. From my personal experience I have to say people usually don't commit suicide lightly. There has to be immense pain over a very long time period so people overcome their survival instinct usually.

Being suicidal makes me so fucking lonely. And talking about my pain feels like self-care. I don't agree with some people on here who claim suicide itself was self-care. For me such a statement is simply insane and nothing else. There are some fringe extreme people in this community with whom I certainly don't agree with. But there are also many people like me who have a biography of abuse and persisting unbearable pain with barely any relief. It feels good the knowledge of not being alone with it. It is so hard to talk in real life about suicide. Most people feel overburdened or don't know how to act and don't know what to say if they are confronted with it. Especially if the person is a very severe case.

I think it is good to be careful posting on here. There are bad apples and you should always monitor yourself whether being on here makes you feel more depressed. At the same time this forum is so unique. I have the feeling the average Joe and Jane does not give a fuck about people like me. They say their platitudes to feel morally superior. I love the following recent post of a forum member on trauma dumping.


Nowadays, most people want to be seen as aware of societal ills but when it comes to sacrificing parts your own comfort for others they find lame excuses. The society is so hypocritial when it comes to suicide. I feel so much more understood being on here. Suicidality is a unique experience and most people cannot relate to it. For example how it feels of not being taking serious. The pressure of family memebers. Disrespectful replies of others. Lack of support. Cynical actions of politicians who want to be seen as defenders of vulnerable people while giving no fuck at all.

Browsing SaSu is for me a huge coping skill. It helps me to survive. And it helps to stomach all of the insane pain I am exposed to every single day. Many on here are very reasonable people. There is a lot of compassion and understanding. You cannot say that about most other corners of the internet. It is a skill for me of not committing suicide for me instead I post here about my pain. SaSu is never closed. Except when it gets ddosed but that's not the fault of the forum. Two therapists gave me up when i was fully honest about the extent of my daily suicidality and torment. It hurt like hell that feeling. And SaSu was there for me. The vast majority of members never judged me. I get compliments for my eloquence. Posting on here distracts me from my misery for a while. Posting on here gives me some meaning.

Real life interactions overburden me very quickly and can trigger me. It is very hard to find as severe cases as me when it comes to my desperation. I am probably a red flag when I am fully honest about my pain for many. I was in an acute clinic recently and I talked to many suicidal people. Some attempted recently. But my situation was from the longterm perspective comparitively the most hopeless one. The other suicidal people acted mostly out of impulse. Some were very critical of assisted suicide for mentally ill people. They were more ambivalent. They still had hope. They still had opportunities.
Me instead I am in this prison for so long. The staff members believed me when I said my consideration to kill myself is very rational. My life quality is horrendous for such a long time. The prospects to improve don't look good at all. It is very likely it gets way worse. For example when my parents die. I am going to commit suicide when that happens. Probably or maybe even way before. I am close to my limit. The clinic stay helped but I don't have much options anymore. I am running out of it.

My conclusion is browsing SaSu is very rational for me. It improves my life quality overall and it gives me the knowledge to end my life when I reach my limit eventually. However, I noticed that I need a time limit browsing on here. Spending the whole day on SaSu is not good for me. For me it depends on the dosage and some rules of not getting too atttached to others. I have the feeling the thread is rather mediocre. I posted so much I don't want to sound repetitive and redundant. Not being alone comforts my soul so fucking much. I can still remember how alienated I felt after my therapists gave me up. The loneliness was so soulcrushing. I never want to return to that state.",2531025,,,,,,,,,,,

Is it rational to browse Sanctioned Suicide?,2540665,Forever Sleep,"May 29, 2024 at 2:33 PM","I definitely think it's highly rational to do research on suicide methods and I agree with you- I think that's what brings the majority of people to the site in the first place.

Beyond that, I applied for membership within minutes because there were so many interesting conversations going on about the really big stuff in life. Plus, almost no holds barred on how negative (and honest) you can be.

As to whether it's rational or even good for mental health to spend a lot of time here. Unsure really. I suspect for a lot of us, this place reflects how we see the world. There's a certain comfort in having your cynical, negative bias confirmed. Because it's likely only going to be challenged or rejected or attacked in the 'real' world. Misery loves company and all that. I suspect to a lot of us, this place feels like home.

As to whether it could potentially impede someone from 'recovery'- I suppose it's possible. I think most people here are more self aware than they are given credit for though. I've known of quite a few members who have left the forum or, moved over into the recovery section because they felt it would serve their mental health better. I agree with you- I think it's important for all of us to be considering what outside influences have on our state of mind. Very few members leave feeling bitter though. Most are grateful for the kindness they have been shown but maybe they feel the negativity overall is too damaging for them.

I suppose it's in the title really- 'sanctioned'. We all tend to validate one another's negative viewpoints and experiences. Is that such a bad thing though? What good is whitewashing over all that?

I suppose that would be my counter-question really. If it isn't logical to seek out a place where you can be open about how negative you feel about your life and the world and not be challenged, then, what would be the 'logical' thing to do? Or- place to go? Somewhere more preventative and pro-life? That assumes that we're wrong then in feeling so negative about life that we want to end it. Are we? I don't know. It's a tricky subject. I'd argue that we have a right to feel the way we do and it's actually more logical to want to spend time in a place where people actually listen to you and respond thoughtfully- rather than just try and shout you down with platitudes.

I feel somewhat similarly to you in that I don't exactly see suicide as some beautiful thing. I think it's a very sad reflection on the life that person had. As for 'self-care' though- actually, I do kind of see it like that. I think people do it to either escape from a current painful situation and/or to avoid one in the near future. For me, I see it as a tragic last resort because that person clearly saw no other way of turning things around. It's an act of liberation I suppose but, it's still sad really that there may well not have even been a good alternative.",,,,,,,,,,,,

As to your questions, I think there's a similar amount of reasons we all come here, and then different ones for us as individuals, and then even more so depending on how our lives change.

I've had the same questions for myself. Like am I just being whiny, lazy, and self-indulgent? or am I so defective that only a select amount of people can understand that their life has lost its ability to actually live and the vast majority of people can't comprehend that, unless it's happened to them. I can see that we as a species are social creatures even if we don't want to be, and at the very least come here if we're isolated irl. So there's the lonliness component. The lack of understanding and validity of the masses as irl you're still a pariah and rejected if you talk about your suicidality. So there's the common ground group factor. The same goes for pain. This is kind of one of those unknowable subjects. I've never spoken to people abroad or see so many people wishing for death daily like myself. It's very interesting, albeit extremely sad and unfair. Maybe it just comes down to ""misery loves company."" Secret suicidal society is what we're reduced to. Awful. There are many who never speak on here, and some who cannot stop speaking so it's this strange dichotomy-paradoxical-lost-vortex in a black hole or something. I don't use media much as it's too overwhelming but this is the strangest place I've seen.

If browsing sasu makes you feel better or helps you improve your life then I'd absolutely say so if not then it's probably time to leave or take a break.

I have heard the phrase ""Came for the methods, stayed for the community"" many times which in my case would be true. If sasu wasn't a site full of empathy and compassion I would of ctb'd shortly after I was able to. I've met some of the most kindhearted people I've ever had the pleasure of meeting on here and the support really helps me get through just living my day-to-day.

I don't feel any different seeing people's situation being awful personally but for some people I've talked to it affects them nor do I feel different seeing goodbye threads. If I don't know the person it doesn't get to me usually but sometimes sexual abuse / trauma can get to me.

For suicide being self-care I think it depends on the definition of self-care. Assuming death is just nothingness like the time before you were born then suicide prevents all future harm and preventing harm is a good thing just like getting out of an abusive relationship. It does come at the cost of removing your ability to feel pleasure so if by self-care it means maximizing positive feelings then it is not. There would also be middle-ground where you could take the ratio of pleasure vs pain in someones life. If we view a lifes value or worth to live as a number and death being 0 then if someones life is in the negatives then it could realistically be classified as self-care. I think it's up to the person to determine whether it is self-care for them or not though.

I remember seeing a statistic that ~20% feel more comfortable with living if they were prescribed a lethal dosage of medication on a government's euthanasia page but I forgot which one as it was a long time ago. I've seen a few people on here say similar things having SN or N helps them live their lives knowing they aren't trapped or obligated to live. For me knowing that I can end my life if it were to get so bad I could no longer tolerate it is a huge comfort that this site has given me. To get similar results I would need to do hundreds or hours of research just for similar results and doing that while not wanting to live will be a struggle to say the least.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Is it rational to browse Sanctioned Suicide?,2545052,Kalista,"Jun 2, 2024 at 1:33 AM","it is rational. there are just far too many people in the world that see's the idea of suicide as a negative concept so the majority pushes the suffering suicidal individuals down as mentally sick people.

one of the biggest point of this forum is to make it known that your life is your own and if you choose to end it, then so be it. it's absolutely not up to anyone else (government, family, friends, people in this forum..etc) whether you should live or die -- only if you make it so.
you also don't have to be in pain to decide kill yourself either, and comparisons between each others' level of suffering to justify suicide is irrelevant. anything beyond that reasoning is just self-preservation in a world you don't want to live in which is no one else's decision. unless you actually want to continue trying.
which then comes back to the long time message the media has taught generations of people about preventing suicide that reflects even from the suicidal people on here, because you'll hear things like, ""do it only as a last resort"" or ""don't do it, you have a lot to live for."" additionally, even the dictionary definition labels it as basically an extreme idea with ways to stop it from happening.
so to reveal that knowledge to people, in this forum, who seeks suicide and methods to act upon is beneficial for self-awareness. to make them realize that this is a real option in life because your life is yours to take.
this is an act towards yourself, not others. you're not trying to kill someone or something else, you're trying to kill yourself. what happens outside of that action is a side-effect.

suicide is a form of self-care because pain and suffering is relieved, doesn't matter whether you like how that sounds or not. i could say im taking care of myself by finally ending everything, instead of sticking around to continuously experience any level suffering. the goal and end result is aligned, except it's permanent so there will no longer be further pain.
the 'mental health community' (a general population whose goal is to recover) just has the monopoly on the word 'self-care.' yet it can be used for the purpose of suicide as well.

being in this forum and participating in it will be a mixed experience depending on your background, beliefs, and/or your goals.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I initially used SaSu for the methods until I started using it to express how I felt, get help from people in similar situations and also to keep up with people. I read so many posts from so many people, some of them are in my mind and I want to check how they're doing. People also make thought provoking posts which are interesting to me.

I think the community is very rich, people are empathetic, knowledgeable, intelligent. My own psychologist was impressed with the quality of advice I received from this community.
There is no other place with this level of empathy, understanding and knowledge. Even when I have better days, I still like to come here, I feel like it doesn't affect me negatively, just a short visit to keep up with people, see what has been happening.",,,,,,,,,,,,
Is it rational to browse Sanctioned Suicide?,2553284,noname223,"Jun 8, 2024 at 12:59 PM","There was a thought I forgot to mention is the following.

I think I am not the only person that feared to get into trouble for being on SaSu. Suicide is in many instances a grey area and the laws are designed to stop people from committing suicide. They should scare people away.

However, I am seriously suicidal since more than a decade. I am close to my pain limit. If I break down again I have to kill myself. For someone like me in severe existential pain it seems to be very rational to do research on suicide methods. The fear of permanent damage stopped me from attempting in the past. I was scared to survive and end up in excruciating pain for the rest of my life maybe as a vegetable. I think this is a very logical consideration. What is worse? The fear of legal punishment or the risk to end up as a vegetable for the rest of your life which could mean 7 decades in agony without relief unable to kill yourself. From this perspective doing research in a very detailed way seems to be very rational. I think this is what stops authorities to crack down on SaSu. We all know there are people in extremely painful situation where committing suicide is a very rational consideration. Which does not mean everyone has to come to the same conclusion experiencing the same circumstances. But in an open society there should be the freedom to choose. Where many people disagree under which conditions should one be able to choose? Are there boundaries or is it fully up to the individual`? Since there is no real regulation (which seems to be wanted) there is a lot of room for the individual. At the same time pressuring it in a certain direction which is wanted be the society. But here I am not sure. The society helps the individual but it depends on the problems and on the country it lives in.

Weighing up the potential legal consequences and the extreme existential pain. Everyone has to decide for themselves. Personally, I doubt German law enforcement comes up to my home one day. Moreover, from the moral perspective I think I have the right to end my life and to inform myself.

It is probably way more intricate than that. But I will end it here.",,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm lowkey fucked,2644555,Kadaver,"Aug 24, 2024 at 9:34 PM","Its as if every time I think things are going to stop getting bad they get worse. I just got my bill for the initial hospital that held me overnight before they transferred me to the actual mental health facility. So now, on top of the $1,500+ that I owe the mental facility, I owe the hospital that kept me for less than a day $831 dollars. I don't have that money! I barely have the money for the mental health hospital and that's only if I wipe out all my savings. All because my roommate 5150'ed me.

I'm financially fucked because my roommate was worried about me. I owe this money because I was forced into the hospital by police! This is so fucking bullshit. And what makes it even worse is that when I got out of the mental hospital my roommate claimed that I was ""stressing him out."" I guess my suicidality and intense mental anguish were inconvenient for him. Then he refused to be around me for nearly any amount of time. He repeatedly brought his stupid ass girlfriend over not even a fucking week after I got out and didn't even ask me if I was ok with essentially being forced to interact with her! Then after a few weeks he randomly sprung on me that he was buying me a plane ticket back to my dads house in two weeks because me just existing in his house was apparently to much for him and told me it was my responsibility to prep my cat for flying and schedule his checkup to get approved to fly within this time period.

When I couldn't he essentially told me that I should have insisted the vet see me sooner and that it was too bad because I was leaving on the day he decided and that he would get some kind of pet transport for my cat to be flown out after I left. I refused to leave without my cat and while I ended up finding a vet who could see him in time, my roommate made me feel like shit about the whole thing.

And on top of the financial bs my mental health is so poor that I can't work a job. I can barely leave my house because of how bad my dysphoria and depression are. Working a job sounds impossible while my mental health is like this and I planned on going on disability and finding some low-incomee housing but I've heard that getting on disability for things like anxiety/depression can be extremely hard and fuck, it just feels so daunting that I haven't even started the process.

I was a little harsh about how I worded some things regarding my roommate and his girlfriend but fuck, this is the only place I can do that. I'm paranoid that he can see my imessages and discord messages so I haven't been able to be this candid with anyone. (the reason is his iPad is logged into my Apple account and his laptop was logged into my discord so I've been super careful because I'm worried about him seeing my honest thoughts and getting offended or mad at me for them.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Venting,2660570,happynuclearwinter,"Sep 6, 2024 at 5:32 PM","What I'm about to write is cringe but whatever. I think people know me as the edgiest mf ever alive, my friend knows that, it's an open secret. To the point people around me can't take me seriously anymore everytime I'm having a breakdown, I don't blame them tbh. I know that being bothered with constant demands of someone else's life threatening conditions suck ass.

So I stopped reaching for help. Atleast with people around me. I kept keeping everyone at arms length because that's what the best for me and you. I don't like being needy. I don't like being so called ""burden"". I don't like showing people how depressed I am, it's humiliating. Heck I wish I'm normal. I want to be normal so bad.

I've went to therapy, not good. Horrible. All I got is +20kg weight gain. I'm bulimic way before therapy happened. Healthcare isn't the best if you live in a 3rd world country. Not anorexic because I'm fat, that's just how they categorize it I think, how convenient .

Okay so the reason? Variable of things. So many factors. Family problems, money problems, how I'm battling with my self image, all that jazz.

My mother was physically abusive growing up, I remembered that my body would be constantly bruising and purplish, which I would poke, because it has this silly shapes and dots upside and I played with it as if it was a sensory toy LOL. Another time I was crying and she grabbed a scissor and starts to harm my left hand, she did this circling motion with the scissor, idk what I did to deserve that. For those who reading this and thinking, ""I was abused by my parents too and I'm turned out fine!"" You are not.

This type of stuff continues until 2020. Where she completely tames out bcs she found a new dude that she dates until now. Good for her I guess idk I don't blame her because she went through a massive pain in the ass what I would called a father, he does everything that every unavailable father would do! Gambles, womanizer, bad with money, alcoholic etc. He's a black belt jiujitsu instructor so everytime he hit me it hurts for DAYS.

It's just so normal in this dysfunctional family. One of my most painful memory is my younger brother would accompany my dad to play poker with his friends and my dad won the gambling. They both went home and my little brother shouted ""dad wins today! We'll eat fried chicken tonight!"". He was 7.

It's not like we were super poor -lives in a shack - type of poor but I just remembered that we can't really afford anything nice. I only go to kfc when it's my birthday. No physical presents. What a luxury. I never complain about this though because I thought this is the norm for every household out there LOL

At school I sticks out like a sore thumb, physically tan (don't come at me with oww dark skin are so pretty!!! My brother in christ we're in southeast asia) messy, stupid loser who draws all the time. I was constantly bullied. Even as a kid I am aware that I'm not conventionally attractive, my childhood pictures looked like a freakshow. No one has a crush on me. My uniforms are hand me downs from my sister (yes I'm a middle child, this will comes out again later). And my parents refuses to buy me books. So all I got is notepads, I feel bad for those who sits next to me. They'll let you know that they don't like sharing.

I've been drawing all my life and that's the only thing I'm good at. I want to pursue art. My parents doesn't really care though. I bought all of my art supplies by myself. They never chip in a single cents ever. Which I take pride in that. All my life I thought if you can draw good then you're guaranteed a prosperous career! I was so fucking wrong.

You need a degree and exps! And mostly luck. My parents refuses to put me to college, yet they sent my sister n my brother out there. This hurts so fucking bad. My mom lied to her friend that I went to college just so she can save herself from the shame.

At this point I just realize it's a blantant favoritism, Mother always talks about how she wants a son and not a daughter, a loser daughter like me. Heck my siblings were abused too but they're supported by my parents growing up.

Creative industry here is also fucked up. Runned by people who don't know jackshit abt drawing. Every so called studio with inadequate shit inside will sucks out your soul alive and pays you minimum wage, working as a cleaning service is much more worth it at this point. Imagine pumping out 1 finished artwork per day and being paid $7 bucks. Your coworkers are brainwashed with the we are family bullshittery. It's a matter of time that I'd be brainwashed as well. I tried to apply somewhere else but I have no luck. That's what I'm lacking. Luck. Or maybe it's all just skill issues from my side.

I wish every exploitative art studios burns. But that's just not how it works and that's not how it'll turns out in the end. I don't know. Maybe I'm just tired. My coworkers kept saying do the bare minimum, but like, they done so fucking good at their tasks, not to mention they do side commissions, like how the fuck did they do that? I'm barely alive when I arrive at my room. I disassociate all the time.

So I pushed harder and harder until I get CTS. Both of my hands caught it. It felt like my world is crumbling. Now I'm actually suck at drawing. I can't do the only thing I can do. This is like the factor that shoves me to the edge. I'm not recovering anytime soon and it drives me nuts. I don't have insurance to cover me because the last time I asked my dad to help with insurance he used my ID card to sign up a shady loan services for $900 without me knowing.

I escape home for a job 1000km away just stuck in another meat prison, so to speak.

I've been looking at SN and I realized how accessible it's here. But to me it's expensive as heck, it's half of my total salary per month.

I want to die so bad. I'm on my breaking point. It doesn't get better. Everytime it gets slightly better life just throws another problem at you. I hate it here.",,,,,,,,,,,,

The emptiness is inside me. And now everyone takes advantage of it to treat me badly because I'm alone and because he was my strength. This world is bad, it's horrible.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Adulthood is literally slavery. If I had my way, I would've stayed a kid forever and never grown up. There's nothing good about being an adult and it's unfair that I was forced to become one",,,,,,,,,,,,

That's one thing that automatically makes me cry or when I see a picture of myself as a kid happy and I tell myself how did that smiley innocent kid turned into this . Makes me rethink for a bit but then I just become depressed again,,,,,,,,,,,,
what has made you cry recently,2655245,SteamaHorns,"Sep 2, 2024 at 12:19 PM","Last time I cried was about two weeks ago. Was pretty stressed out by something that came up and it made me remember that despite how tired I am, I do want to live and somehow seek out my dreams but know that even if I was faced with another chance alongside newfound hope, that I'd be too tired and scared to actually take it anymore. The idea of having realistic hope and a chance to turn things around scares me more than my current situation of knowing that there is none. The fact that I'll have to put in work if I have hope terrifies me which is honestly pretty stupid and funny to me because I never would've imagined a sentiment like this to ever exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,
