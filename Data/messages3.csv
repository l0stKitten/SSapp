Unsure how to secure SN without my family finding out.,2581768,yxmux,"Jul 1, 2024 at 6:20 PM","For context, I live with my parents and younger sister. I withdrew $100 from my checking account and put it on my Cash App so I would be able to purchase SN without it showing on a credit report that my parents are able to access. I ""have"" a credit card but it's linked to my mother's checking account (don't ask why; it's not important for what I'm asking).

My problem is being able to order the package of SN and physically obtaining it confidentially. I'm not one to order packages online, so even discreet packaging would probably look odd or suspicious. They would likely either grow paranoid (especially my father who has made it clear that he's worried about me CTBing) and either open the package or notice that there's nothing new visible in my room. I'd have to obtain the SN without them knowing I ordered something. Ideally, I would be able to set the exact time, date, and location around the outside of the house, but I'm unsure if I'm able to do that.

Also, getting any prescription drugs, noticably dopamine receptor antagonists and benzodiazepines, is going to be virtually impossible without ordering from a gray market/black market and will have the same issues in obtaining them.

Any advice is appreciated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The following text is kinda messy... But I guess my main point is clear.

I mean, personally I understand that it's actually a win. But still, sometimes, I think like people who don't know my full story would pity me and assume that I couldn't endure some mental disorder and was always alone and bla bla bla. Not to disrespect anybody who suffers from it, I might have also had some of this issues, I just don't like the way some people percept the act of suicide. Regardless of what's the cause, I don't like the prospect of them suggesting things... Ultimately I understand that perhaps I'm not really suicidal if I'm bothered by this BS otherwise I wouldn't give a fuck. Or maybe I am and i just consciously acknowledge these absurd fears/thoughts that my mind is creating.

I can't open up fully about my problems to anybody in this world, so I don't want to tell anyone about it partially, because they wouldn't know the full story if i really do kms. That's why I kinda can't make a strong connections to people, because there's always a possibility of me killing myself, i don't want anybody to feel sad because of it and don't want them to know what actually happened and why i did that. So I'm kinda more calm when I isolated for a long period of time. This way the case of suicide will be really vague, because no one could say they talked to me lately",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a woman here where I live who had all sorts of details released about her past when she ctb'd and was missing, that really scared me as my past is similar in some ways and worse in others and not all my family know everything.

Most people I know are acquaintances, I don't have any real friends, never did. I can relate to not wanting or being able to make connections and I too pull away when people get close.

I have worked hard to recover from my issues but I've no more energy nothing helps anymore, I feel a heavy inevitability of my destination.

I'm fairly worthless at this point with little to offer to anyone or society, I'm just a drain again and I am feeling the need to remove myself fairly soon.

I pray that I never wake up but unfortunately it looks as though I will have to make my own way or continue living in physical and mental pain.

You could try writing your thoughts when you ultimately decide to end it all, but a personal fear of mine is that people could easily twist your words and use them against a thing they don't like. For example, a lack of interest in social activities can be construed into a mental disorder by non professionals and a bad relationship with your family can be explained by a third factor ""driving you away"" from them.

I can't give you any advice since I'm not in your shoes, but if I was you I would not care about the fake picture of myself that exists in the mind of others. After all you can never truly know someone, since every single person has a hidden side to them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

[Article] Why money alone doesn’t solve everything and why CTB would be a solution,2581288,TAW122,"Jul 1, 2024 at 10:06 AM","This title may be attention grabbing and broad, but my focus is related to life's problems, injustices, and how yet another example why CTB would have been preferable (again, I don't speak for everyone as each individual's circumstances is unique and to their own). Similar to another thread I wrote about ""Why the criminal justice system (compared to the mental health system) is the lesser of two carceral systems"", this thread is somewhat related (albeit different) to that topic.

A lot of the times, you oftenly hear about the news of wrongfully incarcerated prisoners ending up death row or even life in prison. Then once they are exonerated, they are given compensation (depending on the state or jurisdiction, some do and some don't). This is because even after many years, perhaps decades or so, the inmate is already either near their twilight years or lost all their youth and most of their adult life (when they had peak health and many other opportunities that many people almost take for granted), they only then had scraps left. To a lesser degree and not specifically exonerated inmates, but when it comes to people who are harmed in certain incidents, be it accidents (includes property, life, or limb, etc.) or any unfortunate event like being mistaken for someone who they aren't and even though they didn't lose years being incarcerated for something they didn't do, but suffered due to injuries or what not, there are certainly things that money will not replace. Sure, one could go as far to claim that most people who get the money just go quietly, but that's not the point and I'm not going to entertain the idea that people adapt or such (again, not everyone can or does, nor should!).

So in this article, I'm claiming that money alone doesn't solve everything and while it does allow one to afford copes and/or other luxuries in life, it certainly doesn't solve everything and sometimes one simply cannot recover such losses. Instead, the best society and the guilty party can do is award monetary damages. Then of course, if applicable, there may be talks of reforming the ""broken"" system or changing certain policies to prevent the likelihood of future victims falling into the system and receiving such injustices. That is commendable.

Why CTB would be considered a possible solution when existing remedies and money fail:
When money fails to resolve the grievances, the next best thing society as a whole can do is to at least give the person an out (or when it fails to, the person ends up taking matters into their own hands. I don't endorse nor condone illegal acts or anything harmful to others, especially of unwilling participants). By giving an out, I'm referring to gently allowing the person to be granted a peaceful, dignified exit. Then of course (not solely out of vengeance but justice and reparations) the other next best thing is for the guilty party (including all it's members) to incur a penalty, not just as a deterrence, but as a form of justice. For example, if crooked prosecutor, crooked judge caused a prisoner to lose about two or three decades of said prisoner's life and later it was discovered that said prisoner was innocent, those people and anyone involved must pay reparations. Most people think that money alone is enough, but sometimes it isn't. Money won't bring back time or bring back the lost years, money won't buy certain things (besides copes and whatever is in the present or remaining future of said person's life), and it certain won't solve the damage done.

Sure one could argue that said person is now free and should just enjoy whatever years (be it a few years, a few decades, or however long the person's lifespan remains), but regardless of time, age and weathering will still catch up and someone who is in their elderly or late middle age (late 50's or 60's or even older) won't be able to experience what they missed out in their 20's or 30's, or younger age. No amount of money will buy that experience or even replace those. Plus, this doesn't even include the nonrecoverable losses that will persist for as long as said victim remains in sentience. The duration is really a moot point because it doesn't matter whether the person has a few years, half a decade, many decades, because the fact is the person lost something that money cannot replace, or fix! Therefore, the other solution would either to be let the person go and before they argue about that's injustice for itself, I believe that if the State or any wrong party is unable or fails to rectify the situation, the best option would be just to let the person at least end their suffering after doing what they can (but still failing) to make the wronged party or individual whole. That is the least they can do because at least the wronged party or individual will not be held hostage to the failings of the system or party. Of course, pro-lifers and anti-choicers won't see this logic and those who support justice often cry but letting the wronged party go in peace (euthanasia or ending their suffering) would be letting the bad parties (the State that has done wrong, or the wrong parties) get away with it, but I disagree and digress.

So in conclusion, I hold the stance that there are instances where money does indeed fail to solve everything and not everything can be replaced or made whole. Therefore, it is overrated and short-sighted to claim that money solves everything, especially for those who have been aggrieved or wronged. It may/not apply to all situations, but there has to be more than that. Justice would be the wrong party ending up with repercussions, including the loss of enjoyment and/or sacrifices on their end. While it doesn't bring back the losses of the aggrieved, it will at least bring some form of 'catharsis' and justice to the wronged party. With regards to the concept of catharsis however, that is for another thread altogether.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm extremely ugly and I can't take this life anymore.,2593691,tryptamine,"Jul 12, 2024 at 5:50 AM","Hello, everyone. I've always been extremely ugly (I've been rated as 0-1/10 online), and my appearance has caused me immense pain and suffering my entire life. Since childhood, I've been relentlessly bullied and harassed, called ugly and other insults every day. In middle and high school, the bullying got even worse. I was physically abused, tortured, had my things stolen or broken, stuff thrown at me, firecrackers shoved in my clothes, and was followed and beaten up on my way home. I used to skip school and pretend to my parents that I was there while I actually walked in the woods, waiting to go home. But then the teachers told my parents I was missing, and they forced me to go to school. My parents never supported me or understood my struggle, they just brushed off everything and told me I needed to go to school and study. This psychological and physical torture went on until I was 16 and finished high school. Now, I've been a NEET for almost four years. I have no hope or future. I can't get even a minimum-wage job because of my looks and I can't support myself. I will never know what it's like to receive anything other than pain and suffering from social interactions. I never had a single friend, no one has ever shown me kindness or appreciation. I'm a hideous monster that needs to be destroyed. I don't belong in this world, anywhere or anyhow. Nowadays, I stay inside my house most of the time, but on the rare occasions I do leave, random strangers on the streets harass and make fun of me unprovoked. People even take pictures and record videos of me, which has happened on numerous occasions. I am so ugly that I don't belong in society. No one would want to talk to me or have anything to do with me. My repulsive face causes disgust to everybody. And all of this is because of something I didn't choose and have no control over. It's very painful to realize that all I can really do is just keep rotting in my house for my entire life. Lately I've been extremely depressed and I can't enjoy any hobbies or activities. All I do is just sleep as much as possible, since sleep is the only escape from my horrible life. Not sure how much longer I can take this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

You obviously are loveable and deserve to be loved, every human being does.

What comes to my mind:
If you have a hard time making friends face-to-face, maybe consider joining online communities and making friends trough voice chats.
You also could work home office jobs, you can make decent money with that, maybe later on you could robo-advisor to invest or start dropshipping...

However, you don't have to do all this, you have the liberty and right of dying, it is not ""giving up"", sometimes it is a reasonable choice, but you have to decide.

How harrowing is death by SN poisoning compared to other methods?,2590522,waterworks,"Jul 9, 2024 at 10:03 AM","Here's what you can expect
Nausea and Vomiting: This one is a given as your body will try to get rid of the SN as quickly as possible. Which is why every SN method thread strongly advises getting a prescription strength antiemetic so you can keep it down and speak up the process.
Diarrhea: This isn't expected but is relatively common depending on your diet prior. Most people starve themselves before so it never really becomes a factor.
Dizziness and Headache: Reduced oxygen transport can cause this, which can be migraine level, and some people would prefer taking a painkiller or opiate to help. You could always just wait it out.
Weakness and Fatigue: The body is functioning on less oxygen so...
Shortness of Breath: Due to the lack of oxygen in the blood, which leads to short rapid breathing. Which in some cases can feel almost like suffocating because oxygen isn't reaching the tissues and organs.
Rapid Heart Rate: The heart works harder to circulate oxygen-poor blood, so there could be intense sweating too as your body may view this as a stress response.
Cyanosis: A bluish tint to the skin, especially around the lips and fingernails, due to low oxygen levels. This is just purely aesthetic and there shouldn't be any strange sensations in the areas.
Seizures: These can occur as the cells in the muscles are starved of oxygen, which can lead to uncontrolled contractions and relaxations. How severe this will be depends on the person I guess.
Confusion or Loss of Consciousness: Before you lose consciousness, there will be a feeling of brain fog and lack of clarity. You might hallucinate too (hear things that aren't there etc) but it's not a given.
Low Blood Pressure: Symptoms of low blood pressure are similar to comfusion and loss of consciousness.
You can decide if this is harrowing.

How harrowing is death by SN poisoning compared to other methods?,2590717,wanttogetonthebus,"Jul 9, 2024 at 1:51 PM","I haven't heard any reports of people feeling like they are suffocating because SN blocks oxygen, it doesn't cause a build up of carbon dioxide which creates the feeling of suffocation. So you end up breathing more rapidly, but you still don't feel like you're suffocating. Otherwise SN would not be peaceful and would not be recommended. Suffocation isn't a recommended form of CTB in any publication or anywhere that I've read because it is highly distressing.
To add onto waterworks list you can also experience tinnitus, light headedness, and your vision can get kind of black or splotchy according to some accounts.",2590522,,,,,,,,,,,,

How harrowing is death by SN poisoning compared to other methods?,2590729,wanttogetonthebus,"Jul 9, 2024 at 1:58 PM","Oof that sounds painful. I can see why breaking one's neck wouldn't be reliable and you'd have to jump from quite high I imagine and also for the rope to not break. There's a more peaceful method of hanging that does not involve breaking the neck or suffocation. By compressing the carotid artery that's on the side of the neck, one can simply pass out and die. In face, people often die without realizing it accidentally because a lot of people get a high from quickly passing out from it recreationally and there are also some individuals who find this kind of strangulation erotic.
You have about 40 minutes of uncomfortable symptoms before you lose consciousness. This gives people plenty of time to fully comprehend they are actively dying in real time so it's understandable that this causes people to start panicking or abort their attempts. I think that feeling like they're suffocating is being induced by how much they're starting to panic as this can happen to anyone and is natural when panicking. For people who don't panic and take it easy and fully want to die, they don't seem to report any feelings of shortness of breath but they do report trachycardia and the lightheadedness, dizziness, and lethargy. One account I read who experienced tinnitus from SN described it as minor nuisance since it didn't freak them out. It's sad though that SN can cause some people so much distress but it's also good that they have plenty of time to seek medical attention if they change their mind without serious consequences to their health so that's the trade off.",2590709,2590724,,,,,,,,,,,

How harrowing is death by SN poisoning compared to other methods?,2590757,wanttogetonthebus,"Jul 9, 2024 at 2:23 PM","You're right, that can happen, which is why people who choose this method choose a knot that will continually tighten even after they lose consciousness and will not loosen or come off so that they won't end up regaining consciousness. The method works better the heavier you are because the knot can be tightened more but I imagine that people can also weigh themselves down. Basically if whatever you tighten it with causes you to lose consciousness (I think one person used some kind of straight rod slipped under the ligature and twisted it around and around to tighten it) , it's because your brain isn't getting enough oxygen and you are dying. If the ligature is not loosened at all or taken off you will eventually die as your brain continually starves for oxygen. I forgot the timeframe on this death, but I think it was something like 10 or 20 minutes and you'll be brain dead and nonrevivable. But anyway, you're 100% right that it's super easy to mess this method up and one of the top methods for failing a CTB attempt.

Experiencing shortness of breath can indeed make a person feel suffocated or like they are unable to get enough air. Severe dyspnea most likely will be accompanied by other symptoms such as rapid breathing (tachypnea), chest tightness, or wheezing.

What is your pain vs lethal vs risk ratio,2593745,sometimesoon,"Jul 12, 2024 at 7:25 AM","My ratio is 15% pain, 80% lethal, 5% risk

I have chosen hanging (and maybe jumping) because it tends to be lethal if done right. If you have practised, I am willing to take on some pain in exchange for a high confidence that the method is lethal with a small chance for failure.

I have watched successful hangings, and there is definitely pain, but it looks like such a short duration before they are unconscious.

With a little practice, you should be able to place the rope in a way that cuts the blood flow to your brain.

The failed ones appear to be those that don't cut off the blood to the brain because they are using large and wide cords or bedsheets. They are asphyxiating themselves as opposed to cutting the blood flow.

I am not sure how people feel about pain - is it worth enduring if it increases how lethal your method really is?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

So Confused About My Feelings.,2593716,MBiopic,"Jul 12, 2024 at 6:29 AM","Hey there, ladies and gents. Just think I need to vent to someone, and hear what you guys think.

I've been feeling extremely disconnected and confused lately, especially about how I feel. I understand that my BPD is affecting this greatly, but I have also been feeling more suicidal lately.
Out of the two methods that I liked the most (SN and Night-Night), I decided to choose SN. However, there are a few things that keep me from moving forward with the plan:

1. I have my parents, my brother and my dog. I think I will miss them very much, also I wouldn't like for them to be sad over my death.

2. Even though I try to believe in an afterlife, not a religious one, but more like a perfect one (e.g. imagine anything and make it become a reality, basically your own personal heaven), I have also been a person of science my whole life. No matter how hard I try, there will always be this little voice telling me that there might be nothing, which is pretty likely. But honestly, I don't want it to be nothing.

3. I am afraid of the process itself. What if it goes wrong? What if I get brain damage? What if it will be painful? Suicide, naturally, is a risk. It's an attempt on your life, so, obviously, some damage is inevitable. Still. Hard to get over.

And lastly, do I even really want to die? I want not to feel all this pain that I'm feeling right now, but I also feel like I don't want to cure any of my mental health conditions. I do not want to go back to normal, I don't want to integrate into the society that I despise with all my heart. Maybe I'll never be normal, and I'm okay with that. But what is the escape, then?

Thanks for reading all this, though it's not much at all. I would love to hear what you think, and if you've been in a similiar situation (and maybe if you even got out if it) - I would love to read all about it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Plus, you'd be getting a lot more than just CO. There are a bunch of other noxious gases as a by-product of combustion that will be noticeable (CO is odorless and colorless, right?) and will definitely contribute to unpleasantness. It will probably kill you over time. I'd bet you'd get a pretty bad headache while waiting to go unconscious. Probably burning eyes, too. Bedrooms are fairly large, too, so it will take more time than a smaller space.

2-stroke or 4-stroke generator?

I wish I had gotten the chance to make friends here but oh well I suppose. I took a 4 hr trip, far from home. I'm in a motel somewhere... scenic I guess. It's late afternoon and I will taking a trip to the nearby beach in the evening.

It's a place I came to years ago, when I challenged myself to fight to live. Now here I return, alone, and on death's door. It feels, almost poetic... I love poetry... but no one will remember what I wrote. I'll be forgotten... but that's not really what scares me. Is there something I'm going to? Some divine judgement and unspeakable torment. Even now I'm trembling. But I've been afraid so long, about so many things, that I will just close my eyes and dive into the unknown.

This is not my last goodbye I hope. I will write again when I am setup tonight. It's odd being alone like this, not that my life was full of connection, but somehow ""I never thought I'd die alone""... a lyric from Adam's Song, that fascinated me and now will become my own story in a way.

What was my life? I'm 26 and I'll never know. Everything I've ever known is now meaningless, because it cannot save me. Whether paradise, hell or oblivion... all the time I spent seeking the purpose of this life, the nature of existence... to be someone I'm proud of, will amount to nothing.

SN Experience and Medical Records,2575453,CocoToxBase,"Jun 26, 2024 at 11:38 AM","Hey everyone on the 12th June I survived quite a traumatic SN experience and I am willing to share and include medical documents for information purposes. I have received all my medical records, there is 500 pages but I've took screenshots of relevant parts to show what SN does to the body and how they treat it If anyone is interested. My case is quite strange as I would initially respond to methylene blue treatment and then deteriorate again.

On 12th June I drove 2h away from home to a remote location, It was a car park in the forest. I sat there for a few hours and drank 20g of SN at around Midnight I also took Buccastem, Propranolol, and Diazepam hours before. The symptoms I experienced was slight tachycardia with no chest pain, I felt some discomfort in my stomach, my hands and feet where cold so I turned up the heating in my car but I was still shaking, I had a minor migraine and just felt very sleepy. I'm not sure about the timings of when I actually went unconscious and my heart stopped. According to the police they do 'patrol' checks in that area for the reasons of people dealing drugs there and having sex in the car and they came upon my car and seen me 'asleep' and they say this was at around 1am. I had the SN packet in the car so the police told the Ambulance what I had likely taken where they sent out an Advanced Paramedic who was carrying methylene blue. I was clinically dead when the police got to me, there was a defibrillator on the car park which they used and It brought me back into a normal heart rhythm along with CPR. When the Advanced Paramedic got there they administered methylene blue straight away. I started to show slow clinical signs of improvement and that's where I remember briefly waking up on route to hospital in the ambulance. I'm not sure what my initial methaemoglobin levels where on scene but when I got to hospital there where at 70.3% I received another dose of methylene blue on arrival to resus.

My oxygen saturations on the finger probe on arrival was 47% on high flow oxygen and dropping to 15% at one point. GCS of 8, very pale with blue lips and abnormal respiration with intermittent pauses in breathing requiring breathing aid via Bag Valve Mask. My Methb dropped from 70.3% to 36.7% after the 2nd dose of Methylene Blue, I required another dose of Methylene blue which dropped my Methb levels to 7%. I actually had got up and walked to the toilet at around 3am with 2 police officers and then went back to my bay and started to get some sleep. Around an hour later they wanted to do a repeat ECG and realised here I was very drowsy, I had turned blue again and my sats where dropping to 60% and my Methb raised from 7% to 40% despite having 3 rounds of methylene blue. My GCS dropped, I became hypoxic and I had abnormal breathing so I was intubated and moved to critical care. Despite all the treatment I received my MetHb kept getting better and than rising and this confused the doctors. I had over 10 doses of Methylene blue, 4 blood transfusions, exchange transfusion but despite all this I was still getting worse so they could only think that I still had SN in my gut that was slowly being absorbed. This is where they inserted a Ryles tube while I was intubated and delivered activated charcoal 50g every 4 hours and aspirated my stomach contents. I was intubated in Resus and extubated in Critical Care but was then re-intubated a few hours later due to my condition rapidly deteriorating again.

There's so much more I could write but I've tried to summarise it to the best I could. Below are links (in time order from admission) of the medical notes. I have scribbled out private and confidential information but I have left all medical notes. Also don't get confused with 'table salt' they thought the SN packet was table salt at first and then realised it was SN.

Hope this is helpful :)

I am still trying to be sweet as I can be even if they treat me like shit. my boyfriend insulting my apperance, groveling at me when i feel bad about it, telling me im actually gorgeous and then ignoring me when i try to speak more on it after i forgive him. he also suddenly doesnt want to do anything with me anymore, or anything at all. hes suicidal too so i understand him but he would get mad at me if i did the same and didnt want to do anything. whenever we agree to do something he would act like i am torturing him so i eventually stopped asking for a while, he gets so angry at that, and then i go back to initiating almost everything, and nothing changes its like im still his tormentor. i never ever pressure him to do anything he doesnt want to so i dont understand.

my friend wont stop getting angry over me not explaining every little thing that might indicate that im not well, which might sound great, but its ridiculous when they accused me of being secrety, because i dont know how to talk about something, that i dont open up to them anyore. when i all i did was turn them down like, one time. its like he wants to rip my guts out and look at everything inside. after an overblown argument today i ended up being the one groveling for forgiveness that i shouldve just said what was wrong and that im sorry that i reply to their messages every 5 hours. this happens every 2-3 days im not even exaggerating. i do know theyre just trying to help but it doesnt because this shit happens.

my other friend is so nice to me theyre always there for me they love to hang out with me they dont force me to tell them anything.

Work on stop being a people pleaser, focus on yourself, and friendships will improve. Focus on loving yourself.

You will find better friends, and people in general to be around is what I mean, because right now, these are not your friends and are stomping all over your boundaries, which is unacceptable. One day you'll wake up and see that, and ask yourself why you allowed this to happen.

I know it's hard to get out of these patterns, but you can. It is possible. Start to teach yourself healthy boundaries, and respect for you, and you'll grow as a person.

It takes time and hard work, but it can be done. The first step is showing others you will not allow them to disrespect you, so the word 'no', and 'I'm not standing for this'. You do not need to explain yourself to anyone.

Propane exit bag?,2431606,SomewhatLoved,"Mar 28, 2024 at 2:49 AM","There doesn't seem to be a lot of people discussing propane as a method of CTB by gas inhalation. Basically everything on Google lists propane as an asphyxiant gas, as it displaces the oxygen in your lungs. This leads me to believe that it would asphyxiate you, but not cause the hypercapnic alarm to go off, allowing you to avoid the feeling of suffocation (you continue to breath out CO2, but inhale almost pure propane from an exit bag).

A big problem I see with Argon or Nitrogen gas is that those gases are very regulated and can usually only be bought for industrial purposes in many countries. However, propane is widely used as a gas for grilling and camping and can be bought almost anywhere in liquid form. Google tells me that a full 20lb tank of propane ""contains about 18 litres of liquid propane. When propane converts to a gas it expands approximately 260 times, so 18 litres of liquid propane will become about 4680 litres of gaseous propane"".

Propane is similar to argon in that it's slightly heavier than air and is an asphyxiant. This website, which seems trustworthy, states that ""propane vapor is not toxic, but it is an asphyxiating gas. That means propane will displace the oxygen in your lungs, making it difficult or impossible to breathe if exposed to high concentrations"". Since it is heavier than oxygen, it could possibly be useful to find a way to position yourself in a downward position, so that your head (and exit bag) are lower to the ground with the collar of the bag ""facing upwards"".

Obviously, there is also the risk of the gas igniting, and in multiple other threads propane asphyxiation has been discouraged because of this. However, if you were to make an exit bag and just go sit somewhere next to a propane tank in open air, you probably wouldn't be blowing anything up. If I do this method, I think I would go and sit in a field or some other calm remote place and just look at the stars and listen to music or something until I lose consciousness (which might be pretty quick, with a sufficient exit bag apparatus).

The main issue I see is making sure the gas doesn't run out. If you take the ""tare"" weight printed on the cylinder and subtract that from the current weight of the tank, it is possible to calculate the amount of liquid propane in the tank. Using that information, you could calculate the amount of gaseous propane the tank is able to output. However, the issue I have found is that there doesn't seem to be any LPM/liter per minute flow regulators which connect to propane tanks, making it hard to tell exactly how much propane you are using per second/minute/hour. I would probably want the flow to be consistent for the minimum of an hour. I'm sure there is some way to connect propane tubing to an LPM flow regulator, but I just haven't found out yet -- might need some handiwork lol.

Edit: I think one thing that might be bothersome with propane would be the smell of the odorants that are added to make it stink so a leak can be detected. I work in healthcare, and a lot of people have ""Vick's vapoinhaler"" sticks which are sort of like lip balm, but you put them on your upper lip to inhale the Vick's, and a lot of people use them not as a decongestant, but when dealing with something that has a rancid smell (infected catheters, gastrointestinal bleeding, necrosis, general poor patient hygeine). Suppose you might also be able to just simply use a nose plug or something, or both!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Propane exit bag?,2431841,Kapsyl,"Mar 28, 2024 at 7:16 AM","Interesting idea! Some have discouraged using propane for their obviously explosive properties, but that mostly assume using it inside the homes from a gas stove. Using a tank is more a stand alone solution when restricting it to a bag, but the danger is still there. As you said some tanks may have as much as 4000 liters of gas, even if you restrict it to a bag and successfully CTB the gas will still be released making it an explosive hazard. A well ventilated area or outside even would be more suited to minimize accidental damage to others or property.

The propane gas shares the important qualities of other inert gases as nitrogen, helium as it displaces oxygen in the lungs. Unlike the other gases propane appears to not suffer from lack of purity in the sense of air being present in the gas. Most propane gas appears to be HD-5 quality with it being 90% pure with the last remaining not being air but propylene, iso-butane, butane, methane. It can contain air but I haven't found anything that indicates that.



The hypercapnic alarm may not come on, but I believe something will still feel off when breathing propane making the experience unpleasant. Not to mention the smell of rotten eggs as is often described as. I don't have much experience of propane how strong the smell is if it's possible to overcome it. But it seems to work in theory.

One of the best indicators of a method working is looking at accidents which have been fatal. Most of the accidents are related to an explosive or serious burn and gas asphyxiation doesn't seems that common. But I found this case very similar to what you suggest, and it appears possible.



This is also something I been thinking of, taking advantage of the property heavy gas as argon or propane. If one were to use some form of large tub of container with an open top, you would essentially fill the tub or container with gas from the bottom creating a barrier near the top from air to entering. One could use a smaller container but how would you position the head so you would only breathe from the bottom? Creating som sort of collar in a large open container maybe to stop the gas from going out the bottom but somehow getting your neck through. Creating something like that would be challenging and probably not the project for the average suicidal person.

My thoughts overall is that it could work but it's harder and more difficult to overcome SI than other inert gases. But with accessibility one may have to think outside the box, as you said it's getting harder to get pure nitrogen.

But there are still legitimately reasons for a private person to have pure nitrogen, welding for example. As long there are common needs for something nitrogen will be accessible, but it may be more difficult but not impossible.",2431606, , ,,,,,,,,,,
Propane exit bag?,2432363,SomewhatLoved,"Mar 28, 2024 at 1:44 PM","That's one of my main concerns as well, the ethanethiol odorant would probably be unpleasant when breathing.

Most CTB guides for other inert gases seem to recommend breathing through the mouth, so I suspect it may be possible to plug your nose with something and avoid the smell, at least mostly. As your mouth and nostrils are internally connected, you might end up smelling something anyways, but I suspect it could help mostly relieve the issue.

A few possible solutions I have brainstormed are below:
1. plug the nostrils with earplugs, or possibly even small pieces of wet/damp fabric to reduce the affect of the smell
2. rub Vick's vaporub or other cold vaporizing rubs above your top lip, to hopefully ""cover"" the smell
3. chew gum for a few minutes before making the attempt to cover the mouth with a different scent, reducing the odor of gas which enters through the mouth. Spit it before pulling the bag over your head to avoid and possible complications, keep the method as simple as possible once it starts.

Most resources seem to say that if done correctly, it's possible to lose consciousness in mere seconds. SI may be hard at first, but if you take measures to make yourself comfortable, you maybe be able to reduce any discomfort associated with the method.",2431841,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. Plug your nostrils with ear plugs and breath through the mouth. Most inert gas guides seem to recommend this anyways, but for propane asphyxiation it would reduce the amount of contact your olfactory receptors have with the odourant, as they would really only be able to enter your nose through your throat or small imperfections in the seal of the earplugs
2. Rub something strong smelling (like vapour rub, or perfume oil) under your nose to ""cover"" the smell
3. Chew/eat something fragrant (like gum) to cover the smell, similarly to in idea two
4. Combine! If you do multiple/all of these, there would probably be more coverage",2482604,,,,,,,,,,,,
Propane exit bag?,2483144,Kapsyl,"Apr 25, 2024 at 3:02 AM","All trough not designed initially, my method features a charcoal filter which could filter out the rotten egg smell produced by the methanethiol. The propane itself is odorless so if the filter is effective it should remove most of the smell. I tried looking at specs at some filters but I couldn't conclude if it's successful to filter out methanethiol, its moll mass is quite small compared to other gases. But it would probably help combat the smell, the question is how much.

The bad smelling agent they add is less then 5% of the mixture of propane.







Please review the safety aspects of this method, letting a whole tank of highly flammable gas in a small area like an apartment could have disastrous effect. A light switch turned on could be enough to set of an explosion, potentially hurting the one finding the body or other residents in the apartment complex.

Agreed. As mentioned in my original post, a full 20lb propane tank has over 4000 liters of gaseous propane, which is more than enough to cause a disastrous explosion once released. It's more accessible than some other pure inert gases, but it is also more dangerous.

Apparently propane has been used for this inert gas method, so maybe I'm wrong or I'm missing something, but I worked a job that involved refilling propane tanks, and one thing I can tell you is that propane comes out very cold. Thats how it's stored as a liquid, because it's a gas at room temperature. It's so cold that I've personally witnessed it frost over anything it comes in contact with. So I don't understand how it could possibly be inhaled without literally freezing your lungs, which I imagine would be extremely painful. Again, maybe I'm missing something, but it wouldn't hurt to test the propane before using it this way.

Next Week is my CTB Time,2577026,Acritarch,"Jun 27, 2024 at 5:03 PM","My decision has been made, next week my CTB will take place using the SN method.
I don't know the exact day yet, it will be decided on the morning of the day.

I am disabled, which means that my physical situation also plays a role in this decision, but much more the circumstances of my life, which I don't want to go into in detail.

I have read a lot here over the last few days/weeks and SN is the right choice for me.
Also because I have everything I need for it.
SN from good 3 different sources, with purities of 99.6%, 99% and 98% so that should all fit.

For some, it did not work with SN. This can have many causes, bad SN or they did not stick to the plan.
Often they were found too early or panicked and called for help.
What I also suspect is that it didn't work for some because they may have had to take some medication that had a negative effect on the SN method.
I don't have to take any medication so I can rule out this risk.

I will of course follow the PPH instructions.
I have one request, if anyone discovers a mistake in my plan or if I have misunderstood something, please let me know.

The biggest risk with the SN method (apart from bad SN) is the risk of vomiting.
However, since I want to use the Stat.Dose, I have made a change to the intake of antimetics, I start taking it in the morning that day.

I take domperidone, I have metoclopramide but its expired 1 year ago.
So I take domperidone and I prefer it because I am afraid of the side effects of metoclopramide if you take it all day long.
I would also have ondandenstron and at first I thought I would also take 8mg odansentrone with the last dose but it doesn't appear in the PPH either so I don't know if it would have a positive effect.

This is my Plan, Central European Time (CET)
07:00 - 07:30 CET: Only a small breakfast.
08:00 CET: 10 mg Domperidon.
12:00 CET: at lunchtime, we eat together as if I have to eat something so that it doesn't attract attention.
14:00 CET: 10 mg Domperidon.
20:00 CET: 10 mg Domperidon, and stop drinking Water
21:00 CET: 10mg Diazepam / 500mg Paracetamol (no idea if I should take just one, both or nothing at all. But I think I will need diazepam to calm me down).
21:15 CET: 20 mg Domperidon.

22:00 CET: 25g SN drink.
The first cup will be the SN with 99.6%, then there will be 2 more, one with 99% and one with 98%.
In this way, I also want to minimize the risk of an SN not being as good as I thought.

22:10 CET: 20x10mg crushed Diazepam drinking in Water
Unfortunately, there is no indication of when to drink the benzos, right after the SN or wait and see if you vomit.
You don't want to fall asleep too quickly so that you can drink a second glass of SN if you vomit.

I hope that when I am found at 06:00 CET, CTB has worked.

Here are a few more things I'm not sure about.
I currently weigh less than 50kg so could the 25g be too much?
Unfortunately there is no current table.

It appears that propranolol is also recommended in the new PPH 2024. I have ordered it but don't know if it will arrive in time.
Should I then take the 2g propranolol together with SN?

I also have 5g of phenobarbital, should I mix it with the benzos?

Next Week is my CTB Time,2578137,Acritarch,"Jun 28, 2024 at 3:29 PM","Something interesting about SN.

I have been in contact with someone on Telegram from a chemical channel.
Of course I didn't ask how best to use SN for CTB , I simply asked my question as if I were using SN to make ham, but I haven't done that yet.

Someone wrote to me that SN dissolved in water is best stored in brown pharmacy jars with a tight seal, protected from air and light.
The jars are dark, the glass is thick and the solution retains its full effectiveness for about 2-4 hours before the effect gradually wears off.

A normal cup has no protection from light. Light can accelerate the decomposition of sodium nitrite and thus reduce its effectiveness, this can happen within 15 - 30 minutes.
An open cup allows constant contact with air. Oxygen in the air can promote the oxidation of sodium nitrite, which leads to a reduction in effectiveness.

So if you prepare SN in open jars you should only do this a few minutes before you drink it.
Apparently even 99% SN can have a reduced effect after about 15 minutes of exposure to light and oxygen.


Another interesting thing I learned.

SN with a high purity of about 98% dissolves in water within 1-2 minutes (without having to stir it)
SN with a lower purity can take 2-3 or more minutes to dissolve because of the impurities.
So apparently you can also tell from this whether you have pure SN or not.

So I actually have those apothecary jars. I will prepare the mixture 30 minutes before I drink it, which is enough time without it getting hectic.
This gives me enough time to prepare 3 portions without stress and let them dissolve in water.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Next Week is my CTB Time,2578190,Acritarch,"Jun 28, 2024 at 3:57 PM","The more impurities, the longer it takes for it to dissolve completely in the water.

Normally SN that is not clumped dissolves completely in water with a purity of 98% + in 1-2 minutes.
If it is clumped, you can help by stirring it.

You should use water at room temperature to dissolve it.
If the water is too warm, it can trigger chemical reactions and impair the effect.
If the water is too cold, it will take longer to dissolve completely.

That's how the guy explained it to me, I think he's a chemist.",2578170,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is my new reviesed plan with AE for CTB, I have read up on domperidone again, hence this update.
And an update on the SN intake for my weight.
There are a few things you should bear in mind, there are a few things you should bear in mind, but this probably applies to all AEs.
Of course I try to stick to the plan and only take medication that is listed in the pph.
07:00 - 07:30 CET: 10 mg Domperidon.
08:00 CET: A little Breakfast.
14:00 CET: 10 mg Domperidon.
20:00 CET: 10 mg Domperidon, and stop drinking Water
21:00 CET: 10mg Diazepam / 500mg Paracetamol (no idea if I should take just one, both or nothing at all. But I think I will need diazepam to calm me down).
21:15 CET: 20 mg Domperidon + 8mg Ondansentron

22:00 CET: 20g SN drink (i weight under 50kg, so i mean 20g SN is enough)
The first cup will be the SN with 99.6%, then there will be 2 more, one with 99% and one with 98%.
In this way, I also want to minimize the risk of an SN not being as good as I thought.

22:10 - 22:15 CET: 15x 0,5mg Xanax, 20x 10mg Diazepam, 50x 100mg Phenobarbital crushed, dissolved in Water and drinking.
Unfortunately, there is no indication of when to drink the benzos, right after the SN or wait and see if you vomit.
You don't want to fall asleep too quickly so that you can drink a second glass of SN if you vomit.
If I don't vomit within 15 minutes I will drink the benzos and pheno.

Important information for domperidone and all AEs:
Eating:
Avoid eating for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour before taking the medication.
Drinking:
You can drink water or clear liquids.
Taking Domperidone:
Take Domperidone 15 to 30 minutes before meals.
After Taking Domperidone:
Eating:
Wait 15 to 30 minutes after taking the medication before having a meal.
Drinking:
You can drink water or other clear liquids immediately after taking the medication.
Summary in Bullet Points:
30-60 minutes before taking: Do not eat.
15-30 minutes before taking: You can drink waterin moderation.
Time to take: Take Domperidone 15-30 minutes before meals.
After taking:
Drinking water or clear liquids is allowed immediately.
Eat 15-30 minutes after taking the medication.
These recommendations ensure that Domperidone works optimally by being taken on an empty stomach and having sufficient time to take effect before you eat a meal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

That's what it feels like. Head trauma with cognitive impairments, physical strength diminished, and depressed about not having your full strength in its entirety. Also being robbed of it, and being either having to accept it, or the notion that if you just tried harder, weren't so lazy, you wouldn't feel this way and could have your mind and body back. It's a depressing and infuriating concept. Why bother? No wonder we're lazy. Why fight for 50yrs of misery just to be pummeled everyday, virtually all day, to gain and win nothing. One of many reasons. Certainly not my main one. Sorry your lazy comment just triggered me. But yeah, that's why people get my run-on sentences and walls of text. Take it or leave it.

You're working some big hours it seems; and ctb just seems to be an ex who you want to forget about, and know you should, but can't because there's still appeal and nostalgia (I'll substitute that for peace of mind.) there. So you're chugging on waiting for someone new to make you forget about your ""ex."" Kind of literally But you're also side-tracked. I got distracted by a dude and didn't know how he fit in with my ctb, and then he'd text or I'd think about him and would forget my goal of ctb momentarily. I forgot about my work crush until now lol. I just turned 18 and he was like 21.

Sorry to hear that. My depression has been through and through. It's the diabolical kind except the only person you're willing to hurt physically is yourself.

People can have suicidal ideation their entire lives. Some it helps them knowing they're not trapped and can ""get out"" should things get too worse for wear. Hope your episode let's you find a different way.

1. How is it affecting you?

I've been teetering on the precipice of an enormous mental and emotional breakdown for years now. I often heavily disassociate to the point I'll zone out and have a borderline out of body experience, looking at life like it's through a screen or unblinkingly staring at a wall for minutes at a time. Other times I'll go for midnight walks; I often have an urge to do so. I'm not allowed to do that, and if I ever got caught, I'd be under suspicion. My self-care and sleep schedule are generally complete dogshit, and my anxiety interferes with me getting my license (important step for my CTB). I'm also a major bedrotter.

2. What have you done to combat it?

- I let out my negative or weird emotions/thoughts in controlled bursts, and only online or in my (digital) diaries.
- To avoid having breakdowns due to emotional distress and/or making costly missteps, I avoid IRL friendships/relationships and close relationships in general as much as possible.
- I act upbeat as best I can. I'm really bad at smiling and my resting face makes me look like a psycho (especially when disassociating) but I'm pretty good at being boisterous, cheery, and quick with a joke when people actually talk to me, which takes my vibes from ""suicide/homicide watch"" -> ""weird goofy dude"".
- Using disassociation/practiced apathy to deal with anxiety/BPD. This has been instrumental in muffling my fear of driving and masking my BPD better; why be anxious with no fear of death and clingy when you don't care if they leave?
- Staring off into the void with music blaring in the dark is suspicious, so I go outside and/or go on walks while doing it instead.
- Distract myself with games/movies/creative activities/etc.
- It's often difficult, but I've never broken down and told anyone IRL how I actually feel.
- in short: I have controlled breakdowns, disguise my symptoms as other things, lie a lot, try to keep up appearances, distract myself, and occasionally lock the fuck in

3. If you dont mind, what's standing in your way that is making it impossible for you to do what you need to, to make sure you finish what you have to, to get done?

Okay, but that's not the argument here. I didn't say humans need this theory to explain that. I'm sure homosapiens were capable of much.
Which physics is that? I've not found anything of the sort. In fact, the fermi paradox exists because there should be abundant civilization observable to us, but there isn't. Also your video only gives reasons why we would suppose communication hasn't occurred between us and ET life.
Extinction events are very circumstantial and dare I say random. The dinosaurs just happened to be wiped out by an extinction event with a probability of around 10^(-8); homosapiens have been around even a fraction long enough for that probabilitic chance. Plenty of time for an advanced civilization to evolve. So please explain more on these supposed limiters that are giving you that probability.

While I agree there is a lot wrong with the mainstream understanding of psychiatry, I don't think the practice itself is what's wrong or pseudoscience. I think the reason why psychiatry is still relying on faulty and outdated research, is that academia is like a cult, and it is very difficult for new research to gain ground. I mentioned once on here that though psilocybin has shown promise in trials with minimal to no side effects for the treatment of depression, it continues to be heavily regulated and controversial in the scientific community. It's ""old heads"" who are used to doing things a certain way, have connections in legislature and private industry that depend on this outdated research in order to make profits.

My best friend's bf,2590362,pumpkins334234,"Jul 9, 2024 at 6:13 AM","Me and my friend have been best friends since literally middle school. This isn't a normal friendship either. We would spend 24/7 with each other, share everything with each other. We could talk for hours and hours. I would consider them to be more of a genuine family member than just a friend.

I can say without a doubt that I love them a lot.
However, we both ended up in different places after high school, and things have been really tough since then. I don't want to get too much into detail, but they started dating this guy who I don't have a very high opinion of. I think he's a predatory weirdo who complains about a life I would kill to have.
But I digress. It's important to note that I also have a boyfriend that I dated before they met their bf, but even though I had a boyfriend, I always prioritized them because outside of family they are the most important person in the world to me. I still made sure that I hung out with them and that we spent lots of time together. I wanted them not to feel abandoned just because I have a boyfriend.

Since they started dating their boyfriend, though, our communication has literally dropped so much. We used to talk everyday and now we just send each other reels. When we call, we have nothing to talk about, or when I do try to talk, I'm met with blank stares because they were talking to their bf instead. I have to deal with listening to them talk to each other and basically ignoring me while I'm on call with them. It's like I'm the butt of an inside joke between the two of them. I cannot explain the frustration and sadness I feel when I'm trying to talk to them on call and they start talking to their boyfriend in the middle of a sentence.

I didn't have a lot of friends before them, as I am autistic and I was heavily bullied. Having them ignore me like this just reminds me of when I would get bullied in middle school and people would just talk over me and ignore what I was saying. I feel so unimportant and uncared for again, and generally worthless. I've brought this issue up to them before but they just say we're both equally important and we go right back to it.

I honestly don't know if it's even worth being friends with them anymore. When we call we barely talk. I feel like they see me as a burden and an annoyance. It used to be easy to talk to them, like the easiest thing in the world. Now it's just awkward. Everything I say is met with an ""ok"" or a blank stare. I'm genuinely considering just cutting them off. What sucks is that I literally know that they are not going to last. So they're throwing away my friendship for a mid ass white guy who calls himself a Marxist but lives in Hawaii that they will literally never speak to again after their inevitable breakup. Every time I hear his stupid voice in the back of the call I feel like cutting my own ears off. What sucks is I don't really even have a leg to stand on with this. I can't even put my finger on why it bothers me so much. It's normal for friends to have boyfriends and talk to them. I guess it's normal for friends to grow apart and not have things to talk about anymore, and maybe I don't have to make such a big deal about it.

Sorry for the long ass post, I just really needed to vent about this. I'd say what makes me the most suicidal these days is knowing that people don't care about me the same way I care about them. Not my boyfriend, or my best friend of 8+ years. The only person who truly had my back, my brother, killed himself. I don't know what's wrong with me that people are okay treating me badly. I think maybe I'm just being overdramatic because if I have an issue with so many people I must be the problem.
I don't know why I'm so upset about it to be honest. It's pretty pathetic and funny that after everything I've been through, one person not talking to me enough is what finally makes me want to do it. Like girl worse things have happened to you! Calm down!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are all sorts of routes friendships can take. Personally, my closest friends are all people I met in my mid 20s (I'm 31).

I never ""cut off"" any of these people, we just moved on to different things over time. Every now and then one of them will send me something on linkedin or my phone will show me an old picture of them and I'll feel nostalgic, but not resentful or regretful.

The truth is, I have changed a lot as a person. It's not their fault. My values and personality have just shifted. The old me isn't completely gone, but what was a great friendship match before is now only above-average. It's okay. A bit sad, but a part of life.

1 week when I was supposed to collect my student ID and complete the final stages of enrollment late minute issues regarding tuition fees meant I was not able to start my course. I was forced to defer as result it absolutely broke me.

Starting from New Year's Eve in 2023 throughout the year I have had nothing but bad luck and a long line of things going wrong in all areas of my life and so many crazy situations I found myself in. I was determined to make everything work out because I am not a quitter. Getting into that university was my new fresh start and beginning of a better life. Everyone else my age is married and has a career all I had was getting into that programme. All i wanted was 1 bit of happiness 2023 couldn't give me that.

I tried getting a job but constantly I get rejected all the time. My 27th Birthday was in May and I finally had a nervous breakdown. The year I start my course is the year I should have been preparing for final exams and graduation it makes me furious realising everything I have lost out on. I see everyone else my age with a career and a partner while nothing is going right for me in my life

I hate it when people tell me ""it's only a year"" NO it's more than that it's finally driven me to want to kill myself because life is not worth it anymore.

I'm not sure how it's organised where you live, but if age really matters to you, you might consider doing a part-time Masters. Although in that case you'd probably be the youngest student.

I don't want to trivialise your feelings, because it really sucks to see everyone around you reaching milestones while you're stuck and struggling, but it's okay to do things at your own pace, there's no rush (even if it feels like it) and nothing is lost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Before I had to drop out of UCLA (couldn't afford it), there were multiple people in my classes in their 30s and 40s even, and this was just undergrad. Marriage and careers sucks anyway, what's the rush. It's not like people who have those things don't still decide to ctb. Some of them may be members of this forum.

For most people, that feeling of incompleteness just transfers onto something else when they get the thing they wanted. Someone who is miserable because they're not married, often finds, after they get a spouse, that something else makes them feel chronically empty. As soon as a desire is fulfilled, a new one takes its place.

Sorry I guess I have a shitty way of trying to be reassuring. Instead of ""it's not as bad as it seems,"" I tend to say, ""getting the things you want won't make you happy anyway, so stop worry about not having them."" I'm not trying to bring you down though.

And it was the year the government hiked up tuition fees astronomically in the UK. It threw me for a loop too. I was 28 when I started. I was nervous about the age thing too but I think I was one of at least five mature students in my class. We tended to hang around together but I was lucky that pretty much everyone else was nice too.

That's not to guarantee that your experience will be the same. It's more that- you simply don't know. This could end up being the best thing you've ever done. It could get your life back on track. Mine did with me- at least for a few years. Alternatively, you could be right, it could all be a complete waste. You just won't know until it begins. September I presume? Only a few months to wait now.

I really hope that when it starts, it will be a good experience for you and draw your attention away from all the bad stuff that's happened recently.

As for everyone having a career and partner. Do you go on social media a lot? I tend to avoid that now because it just makes me feel shit. Not everyone has those things by that age. I certainly didn't. I don't even have a partner now and I'm 44. My so called career is so flimsy too. Not everyone is a success but I suspect most of the ones on social media will at least pretend that they are.

From what you've said about yourself in other posts- that I can recall, I imagine some people would already think you had succeeded in certain things. Didn't you have a job at a law firm? That's pretty intimidating for someone so young. I remember that some shitty things happened there- I'm sorry about that. In a way though, all these things teach us what we want in life and what to watch out for- to avoid. In some ways, I'm grateful for the unpleasant jobs I've had- I've learnt not to do them again!

Anyhow. Sorry if this has all come across as patronising and insensitive. It's not meant to diminish how you feel. I suppose I just hope that this course will give you the reason/ motivation to feel hopeful again and to maybe start to forget some of the recent shitty experiences you've had.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really do know how you feel, it's such a horrible feeling to be behind all your peers, but eventually you realise that not a lot of people care about your age, and having more experience can even help you more.

These women I grew up with now have husbands, children and others have successful careers. I have a family where relatives show off and I am not allowed to be open about any mistakes in my life because my relatives will finding it hilarious I am failing. When I got fired a couple of days after my firing my mum said "" If auntie X asks about how is work don't mention you got fired she will be gloating and telling everyone""

I have relatives who enjoy seeing others fail because they hate the fact my family moved to the west and they didn't. In African immigrant families living in western jealously is rampant amoungst relatives. I actually hate my relatives they are the worst relatives in the world. My family keep forgiving them and tolerating their behaviour and expect me to do the same.

What have I got ?

I can't get over the man I love, this heartbreak feels impossible. I feel in love with a 55 year old man because he made me feel so special in a way no other man has done. All life guys my own age ignore me and never care to know me. I have the confidence to talk to guys, ask guys out and always show genuine interest in the things happening to them

I never worked in a law firm, I worked for a large housing corporation with a well paying salary and I got fired from it. One of the worst things about getting fired is I never even got to show what I was even good at.

It's makes me so angry because everyday I am crying for everything I have missed out on. I don't cry over things but this whole situation has broken me in so many ways. People think I am being dramatic.

Right now I should have been attending lectures and preparing for exams. Winter season was meant to be the year I graduate had I started on time last year.

it's makes me so angry how last year I had constabtly had a string of things constantly go wrong for me at the last minute. Sometimes I can't believe this has actually happened to me. It stared to go wrong from New Year's day.

New Year's day I was so upset at Heathrow Airport because I was forced to see my relatives overseas. I loved the Covid 19 pandemic because its was pure bliss freedom never seeing these relatives again due to travel restrictions. Growing up in a immigrant family my life has been spent visiting relatives in my parents home country ( African country)and I have always hated the trips since my teens. They were the worst summers of my life being stuck with relatives who dont care about me and constantly being forced to be something I am not. I grew to hate summer holidays because of these trips.

I can't even share my real feelings with my mother and grandmother.

During the stay we had a long line of things going wrong.

● National Power cuts the week we arrive
● The same week we arrived we are forced to move from our regular holiday accommodation due to the housing not being safe. Every trip we use this accommodation provider with NO problems

● My relatives as usual were just being so fake nice and entilted as hell. When we are in the UK these relatives show my family no respect but the minute we arrive in the country relatives are all interested in playing happy families. They do it because they want something they think because we are from the UK we have money and gifts.

● All I wanted was to go home and looking forward to the plane journey. Mid air our flight gets cancelled due to damage detected. I was so upset why out of ALL the planes the flight I am on gets to have problems.

● I regualrly sought comfort in an older man who I knew in the UK to escape all the feelings of being trapped .

February
● Heartbroken
● Fired from my job. Before I got fired I was struggling at work. So much went wrong at work.

My confidence was absolutely destroyed. because all I became known as the colleague who messed up all the time and I never got to show what I was good at.

Even simple things I was good at I messed up.

April
● Eating disorder gets exposed after my mother decided to open my parcels and found the new diet pills I ordered.

● May
I get accepted into the university

June- August
● looking forward to going to university I was so ready to start and had all these plans

September
● Forced to defer

November
● House gets damaged due to repairmen not fixing things properly. It was simple repair job.

December
● Planned trip to go to Brussels which I was looking forward too got cancelled.",2590136,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's circumstances completely out of your control, and it's awful how even your family refuses to empathise with you.

Your family sounds incredibly invasive and insensitive. I'm very sorry you have to deal with them. I hope one day you can move far away from them and see them only on your terms.

,2592367,Forever Sleep,"Jul 11, 2024 at 1:05 AM","I just think it intensely illustrates our different perspective on life itself a lot of the time. Why play a dangerous, risky and painful game if your view of the game is that it is corrupt, not worth your effort and pointless?

Is it 'cowardly' to resign from a chess match because you know you've lost or- you're at a stale mate and it will go on forever? Depends how much you care about the game I guess.

Same deal with life really. Something has to feel worth fighting for to put the effort in and appreciate the reward- if you even get one. Quite possibly you may not if things like anhedonia/ depression are at play. You may just hang on for a whole lot more monotony. Is that really all that brave? It probably feels kind of foolish to someone who places so little value on life itself.

Obviously, life is going to seem less trivial than a chess match to most people and where I suppose it does differ is- a suicide can devastate loved ones. I doubt it's many people's priority to hurt other people with their suicide though. It's a very unfortunate side effect and, some of us will hang on for years- even decades to spare them that pain. Will they consider that brave? Unlikely. They'll probably just take it for granted till you aren't there anymore. I think many of us are too selfishly wrapped up in our own lives to care that much about others. It's when things affect us we start to take notice.

It's not to say I think continuing to live can't be brave. I do actually admire elderly grandparents in my family who it seemed to me did hang on for as long as they could to be there for us. That was natural death rather than suicide. I do admire suicidal parents who are trying to hang on to be there for their children.

Beyond that though- actually creating a lifeform here that will be dependant on you, I do actually think it's kind of unfair to put this burden on people: 'Your death- especially suicide will upset other people so- don't do it.' Not that we shouldn't take it into account of course but ultimately- we didn't choose this.

We didn't choose or maybe even want people to care and become dependant on us. Perhaps to some extent, we invited it in- if we went out looking for friends and partners. A lot of the time though, we were in situations we couldn't have avoided and these relationships occurred as a result. We were born into families, went to school, college, uni, went to work. It's hard to avoid people completely and avoid some bonds forming. Those choices weren't really choices for us. Our parents made the choice to bring us here. Then, it's pretty much illegal or inviting in destitution if you don't get an education and then a job.

Maybe it's extreme to say but, I feel like we're born into a trap basically and, we're held here via emotional blackmail. I think that's utterly unreasonable. People seem to accept it because I suppose natilism is so normalised. They see life as the status quo that you simply have to accept and do what you can to work with.

We don't though and ultimately, no amount of shaming- calling it cowardly or, guilt tripping- calling it selfish is going to hold back the most desperate of us.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

<><><><><><><><><><><><><>

What Works:

When you shoot yourself, your goal is always to hit the brainstem. Here are the reasons:

1. It is the most essential part of the brain and controls nearly all functions necessary for survival. Your breathing, heartrate, autonomic functions, and even consciousness itself through the Reticular Activating System.




2. The brain stem is surrounded by the largest and main arteries that supply blood to your brain like the Posterior Cerebral Artery. If the bullet or the tremendous kinetic energy pings these arteries open you are 100% done for.




Now that we established that your brainstem is the goal, let me tell you how to do it:

1. The most reliable way by far, is through the roof of the mouth. Put the barrel of your gun into your mouth directly parallel to the floor, now tilt it back at roughly a 45° angle. Steady it in your hands and squeeze the trigger. BANG! Lights out.

I created some diagrams to show the angle you are going for:




2. Though the parietal bone. This is more tricky to do with more room for error, so I don't recommend it. But you can shoot yourself from the side of your head and humanely kill yourself. I will go into how its possible to mess this up in the next section. Here is the area you're going for:




As you can see, the easiest way to achieve this angle is to place the barrel of the handgun directly above your ear, at roughly eye level. If done correctly this will also accomplish the goal of hitting the brainstem.

In conclusion for this section:

The brainstem is obviously the best way to do it. Any reasonably powerful handgun round, rifle round, or shotgun load will accomplish this feat. But by far I reccomend you use a 12 or 10 gauge shotgun with a .00 buckshot load. If you do choose a handgun round, I highly recommend using hollowpoint +p bullets to maximize energy transfer and tissue damage, and no less than the 9mm cartridge. As for rifle rounds, there aren't many hollowpoint bullets in standard rifle calibers. But pretty much any big game hunting cartridge will do it.

<><><><><><><><><><><><><><>

What Doesn't Work:

1. Shooting yourself under the chin. Just don't do it. Please. To be honest I'm not even sure how this method became so popularly depicted as a humane way to kill yourself, seeing how many people have blown half thier face off and wound up with a life much more worse then the life they tried to end.

Here is why you should NEVER EVER shoot yourself under the chin. To fully impress upon you just how badly you can fuck this up, I feel that showing you some NSFW imagery is necessary:",,,,,,,,,,,,,

More people survive this then you'd like to think. The frontal lobes of the brain are the least essential to survival and in some cases (like that of Phineas Gage) you can blow out basically your entire frontal lobe and survive for literally decades afterwards.

Take this case for example:



He looks pretty dead, right? WRONG. Here is a case of a man who lost most of his frontal cortex during an accidental firearm discharge and lived:



This is the explanation I wanted to elaborate on in the previous section as to why shooting yourself in the side of the head is achievable, but not recommended. Remember, if you want to shoot yourself from the side of the head do so from the parietal bone, just above your ear at eye level.

Shooting yourself in the temple like you see in movies is bad, and doesn't always end in death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,913777,TAW122,"Oct 7, 2020 at 8:49 AM","Excellent resource and lots of good information on shot placement as well as diagrams and drawings. One thing to add is that for people who may reposition the barrel or flinch when pulling the trigger, do not try to anticipate the shot as even moving a few inches could result in a greater margin of error. Most likely, once the bullet leaves the barrel, one would already be gone before they could even feel the recoil of the gun.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,913784,Bleak Stoic,"Oct 7, 2020 at 9:03 AM","In addition to that, people often forget about the tremendous energy of the gas expelled directly out of the barrel. Even if you ever so slightly miss, the energy from the expelled gasses will almost certainly ping the brainstem and destroy it.

This is yet another reason that shooting yourself through the roof of your mouth is objectively the best option. Once the bullet breaks the base of your skull, the enormous energy from the expelled gases will pretty much obliterate your brainstem. If the bullet hasn't already. The more powerful the round used, the greater this effect will be.

Here's what a blank load with no bullet will do to a watermelon at point blank range:",913777,,,,,,,,,,,,

But your goal to induce instant unconsciousness is achieved by hitting the upper part of the brainstem just under the thalamus. That's where the most activity is in the Reticular Activating System. Destroying this part will render you pretty much instantly unaware, and death will very soon follow.",913795,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you manage to point one approximately at your head and pull the trigger, you will hit something, and that ""something"" will probably kill you.

If you still think you could miss somehow, shorten the barrel to about 18"" (which is illegal in the US, precisely because a sawed-off shotgun is so effective at punching holes in human beings and so useless for anything else).

This is my go-to method to ctb, by the way. I live in the US, in a state where 2/3rds of the population goes deer hunting, no less. Getting the right equipment is cheap and easy. I suppose I'd take poison of some kind if I had to, but I'm glad I don't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2582636,PinballWizard39,"Jul 2, 2024 at 1:45 PM","Ok, so this is my situation and I need to know if this is just me or not. Very long story short, I have suffered from all sorts that people like to label depression, anxiety, PTSD, CPTSD, anorexia, bulimia, self harm etc etc.. for over 25 years. It stems from years of abuse and trauma and mistreatment from the mental health teams on top. This last 6 months or so, the MH team had to take me back on after spending years ignoring me and my doctors referrals (I had a massive breakdown at work :( ). AFter a month of two of faffing with medication, I was told I could access longer term therapy (up to a year), to help me overcome some of my issues, however, on the first session I was told I was actually only getting 12 sessions. The little hope I was given, got smashed in front of my face. If my depression wasn't bad before, it was then, and since then, I have just been getting lower and lower. Over that time I've been coming here more and more (I did come here back in Nov//Dec time, I just lurked at the time though). I feel like there is nothing else I can do but ctb. After these session finish in about 3/4 weeks time, I won't be eligible for anymore and the NHS is seriously broken so there won't be anymore help. They have all themselves suggested I go private, but seeing as I'm not even well enough to work full time, and I only make minimum wage, I am barely affording to pay all my bills.

I can't live like this anymore. I am becoming more and more bitter towards people because I envy all that they have. I hate listening to people talk about their kids, their partners, the cinema they went to, the festivals they danced at. Their weddings, their career goals - all of it - it makes me want to cry and yell at them all to shut the fuck up. I hate it and I hate me for becoming like this - this isn't me. I feel like I am so angry because I don't actually want to die, but with the situation how it is, I do not see any alternative. I'm nearly 40 and my life feels like it hasn't even begun and not through any fault of my own. I'm always looking for the help I need, I try to better my life in any way I can and I blocked in every god-damn way. It's not even just that I can't live like this anymore, I don't want to live like this if this is as good as it gets. And it's looking very much like this really is as good as it gets for me. I'm even thinking of bringing the ctb date forward.

Does anyone else experience increased bitterness and envy?

Sorry for the length of the post.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2582657,lack,"Jul 2, 2024 at 2:06 PM","i feel very much the same. just offered 10 sessions of therapy, after reaching out for support.. feeling tired of hearing of everyone elses lives which are so fucking incredibly unrelatable and feeling like my life hasnt even begun.. while everyone else my age seems to be thriving if not at least striving and im over here fucking hardly surviving. and all for what? lately it feels like life is so fucking pointless, there's way too much unnecessary suffering on a global scale for any of us to fully ever really be able to feel any kind of real peace; it's impossible to relax when there's so much horrible shit in the world, and it really feels like theres so many existential threats regarding the climate... and it feels like the only thing people around me care about is material goods, or a sense of success. and accomplishments (all of which i cant even partake in for various reasons). it feels hard not to yearn for those things, too, and to know im so fucking far away from them. between the personal suffering, the global suffering and the general ignorance to everything.. makes me just, so full of every bad emotion. jealousy, bitterness, resentment, fury.. i don't even have a job (i get a bit of assistance from my government for disability), but i've been trying to get a job. i keep being told that the support i need as a disabled person to have customized help with employment is going to take longer than originally expected, but i had to move recently and i have no money for food or bills at all without a job.. it all feels like its falling apart.. i literally have yelled at many of my friends and family due to the disconnect between them blabbering on about career goals and weddings and concerts and movies and whatever dumb shit they all fucking talk about that i am never apart of and feel that i wont ever have. i respect your restraint, i wish i had that as maybe my friends and family wouldn't be afraid of interacting with me so much.

i feel like im barely keeping my head above the water, so to speak.. just to see the best of what's waiting ""on land"" for me isn't any better.


the only people who i relate to are people who are basically fed up and finished with life, which is an odd reassurance that at times keeps me going.. but with politics and climate change and everything bearing down; i just.. i also just want to ctb and i've been making more plans towards that, lately. i don't know what the point of working towards anything else other than death is.


a footnote; i live in canada and i assume youre in the UK. i think its so fucked up that it reaches all over the world, this exact sort of situation.
a person is forced to suffer due to a lack of support, but theyre also forbidden to end the suffering in any way other than a gruesome one, alone. it breaks my heart. but it usually pushes me to want to leave this hellscape even more. what an awful place where we force each other to suffer and deny the support they need to either live a better life or even just end it all entirely. urgh.

,2582671,PinballWizard39,"Jul 2, 2024 at 2:18 PM","In one respect, I am glad that I am not the only one to be feeling the way I am. At the same time, it's so wrong that you and others can relate. It shouldn't be like this at all.

A few weeks back I tried to get someone to listen (MH worker), I told them I was suicidal, though I gave them a different method when they asked (just in case they asked me to give it to them, though I had a hunch they wouldn't, but didn't want to take the chance). All they did was ask if they could get someone to call me 2 days later, because you know, 'you matter to us' and all that. I never received any phone call and no-one's checked up on me since. In one way it confirms to me that no-one who is 'supposed' to care, actually gives a crap, and there really is no other way out.

I am in the UK yeah. I get part time wages from work and the government thinks that topping it up by £100 is going to make up the difference. Ironically if I worked less hours, I'd be entitled to more from the government.",2582657,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2582707,lack,"Jul 2, 2024 at 2:49 PM","It's so upsetting to me that you didn't get that call (though sadly, unsurprising). stuff like that really pushes me over the edge; the confirmation that anyone who is supposed to care doesn't. especially when it's their literal job to do so.. it feels hard not to interpret it as them saying you're not important. the other sad reality that I think about a lot in these cases is that there's just a large workload of mentally ill people trying to access care and support and that people simply fall through the cracks as a result of overworked understaffed medical resources.. it's all just shit. for everyone.

ughhh, the sweet spot of being too fucked up and not fucked up enough. im so sorry they think £100 adds up to anything towards a decent quality of life for someone who's struggling with so many mental health concerns. the NHS sounds especially shit. Canada has it's own mess of healthcare bullshit, but it doesn't sound as bad as the NHS in some ways, so you have my further condolences on that (having to rely on the NHS, amongst all else).


it seems between all the different things that add up in the cost of living, it feels like there's no chance at a decent quality of life",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,2582748,PinballWizard39,"Jul 2, 2024 at 3:20 PM","Yeah, it's kind of like 'you're literal job is to give a shit and you can't even do that'. My anger further gets riled up because of the amount of times they have failed me in the past, to the extent they denied me treatment for anorexia and I came within hours of dying. Saying all that about anger though, I have a very hard time expressing anger so when it starts leaking out, it comes out as me being really pissy with people. I guess that doesn't help how they then deem me. Still.

I have lots of empathy for the NHS problems, I work for them (not in MH thankfully), but sometimes I just want to say 'I came to you for help as a kid because I was fucked up, you fucked me up worse over several years, refused to help me further for years more whilst more trauma happened in my life, then you only take me on again because everyone's kicking off, now you try drugging me up again and offer me 12 sessions that are supposed to cure 25 years of trauma - are you having a laugh?' Because I'm not your ordinary MH patient, as in, I can function to some extent, even in my worst time, I quite often don't get believed or taken seriously. I have my care co-ordinator tomorrow and I'm guessing that will be fun times as usual. Sometimes I wonder if I should just tell her exactly what's going on for me, my plans to ctb and all the rest of it, just to see if she'd have any reaction at all. But, at the same time, I don't want to risk her removing my means. I definitely don't need to worry about being locked up, there's no psych beds anywhere anyway lol.

I don't know anything about the Canadian health care system but it doesn't sound much fun either.
I get you on that. I was with my ex for 9 years. He was an alcoholic who emotionally abused me and he would sexually assault me regularly - something I still have trouble saying out loud or putting the correct name to.

I don't know what the hell happened but I had an almighty 'breakdown', which left me blurting out how I had a detailed plan and date and my hope for anything ever getting better was zero.. I'm not one to make a scene, but god.. She asked me if I would let her help and get the home treatment team involved. I argued that there was fuck all she or anyone else could do at this point. However, I only agreed because I don't want her or anyone else to throw shit at me in future like ' you do nothing to help yourself'. I made it clear I'd go along with it but I have 0 faith., hope or anything else from it.
She asked me to leave the room while she called them. They are now coming to see me tomorrow. No matter how much they might ask, I will not give up my means (not that they've asked me for them previously when I've told them). If it comes to it, I'll just give them the iron tablets or ethylene glycol I told them I felt like taking in the past. It means I can't go to work, which means another sick day that I don't get paid for. There's no guarantee they will take me on anyway so this could all be a distant memory by this time tomorrow. I feel so fucking low, so tormented because I really want to have hope, but at the same time, there really is none.

You deserve peace here already, but the dread of not attaining it is so painstaking, I know that, and if you go through with your plan, I hope you know that there are people here that will grieve your passing because we already empathize with your circumstances that make you want to do it.

Fake Rich - New Trend Growing Influence Among Millennials and Killing Money - Due
More people are now falling prey to the growing ""Fake Rich"" trend, leading to financial blunders and ultimately a vicious debt cycle.

Very few people live the perfect life. Most of it is a facade:


At one point I had it all. A wife, my own successful business, house, social circle, etc. I was pressured into thinking that that was what life was all about. Turns out that life isn't about anything at all. It's completely pointless. Now, at the age of 44 all of that has been gone for about 7 years and I can honestly say that I don't miss any of it. Too much stress. I thank god every day that I wasn't dumb enough to have children.

You could have very well spared yourself a lot of agony. Especially the way things are going now in this day and age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I get that. I know not all is rainbows and butterflies for people. I guess what I'm meaning is that I would like a bit of 'normality' in my life and I suppose to me, those things represent that in a way. I've spent my life in and out of psych wards, general hospitals, everything mental health related - appointments/assessments etc. There's been nothing remotely 'normal' about my life because of the lack of the right support. People joke all the time 'who wants to be normal?' Well I'd quite like a bit of it. I guess I'd just like a bit more of a balance and not just suffering from my lack of mental health.

I'm ""only"" 28 yrs old, but my whole youth was wasted due to my mental health. I didn't get to experience the stuff that normal people do. Never had friends, never have the chance to go to any kind of party, and all that stuff. Never had any relationship, I didn't even got my first kiss yet.
The mental health services in this country are so fucked up, there's not really any help at all.
I envy all the people I see, not just online but mostly online. I get that a huge part of this is lying and acting like they are so happy when they are actually miserable, but it doesn't change the fact that - at least they have money or a family or something.
I am broke and in a healthcare debt. I currently have 2 shirts and 2 pants, and that's about it. Living with mental hell and trying to work is extremely difficult. I have a small part time job that I can do from home but - as you can see it's not enough, I still can't buy clothes or healthy food or anything.
I am so fucking jealous when I see them pretty girls online. I want to be like them soooooo bad. I just don't understand why they have the privilege to be pretty, and why I don't. Why are they able to afford luxury skincare and shit when they are 10 years younger than me. How? Why? Why can't I? Why am I so undeserving of any kind of love or comfort?

Maybe it would be a good thing to be jealous, as I would have something to strive for, but I have removed myself so much from developing as an adult that it's too late now to catch up, and like I said, the goal isn't even desirable.

,2587374,disabledlife,"Jul 6, 2024 at 2:34 PM","I feel the same as you, I completely identify.

I've already told my life story all over this forum, and I thank and appreciate having support, kindness, being able to express myself without censorship... I'm tired of it to see people around me succeeding in life, having grown up well, being handsome, strong, heavy, perfect, good jobs, lots of money, social status...

I also told, in this forum, that I was part of a High IQ association (world famous), but be careful, I hate the elitism of the members of this shitty association, and IQ is crap, that doesn't prevent intellectual laziness. Regardless of IQ, people can be very intelligent, in my school, there were intellectually delayed students, and yet, I saw them as very intelligent, they had a heart, were attentive, knew how to have empathy . Even animals are capable of all this, but most humans are not. In this high IQ association, the members talk about their beautiful lives, that they are tall, handsome, doctors, lawyers, highly qualified, business leaders, have a beautiful big family, children, beautiful houses, cars, make trips all over the world, first class, etc, etc!! I was tired of them belittling me for living off society, they told me that if I CTB, it wouldn't be their problems. Most people no longer wanted to hear about my life story, which I told, faced with this injustice of my life compared to theirs, they rejected me, blocked me, ghosted me, kicked me out of quite a few social media groups! There is a girl who gossips, thinks she is an Insta influencer, etc., like the perfect American miss, who behaves like the leader of a gang, a pack, who has decided to destroy me, lynch me, etc. Anyway, I also ghosted all these people and played dead, no one gave me any news! The mentality of the people of my country disgusts me, hypocrite, intolerant, non-inclusive..., but these people are hypocrisy multiplied by 10 100 1000...!

I am a disabled person who had a stolen life. I am autistic, and high IQ, and suffer from many physical disabilities including Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, which makes my life hell.

I was promoted to a brilliant future, as an engineer or scientist. But, I had to stop my studies. Beneficiary of state aid, which gives me the right to social security for workers, but as a differential right. But as a young student, I was obliged to subscribe to student social security, this was around twenty years ago, moreover, the president of my country has since abolished it. But because of their incompetence in reimbursing health costs, debts accumulated and I had to abandon my studies, and my future, to return to social security by default, which had reimbursed me everything, but goodbye my studies, my future. Now I am halfway through my life, my health is deteriorating.

Then, I spent my entire youth seeing my mother, from the end of her life until her death, almost the only person who wanted to see me, the other members of my family reproaching me for living on state aid. State.
A relative, also disabled, accompanied me, helped me to go out, spoke to me,... following the death of my mother, so that I was not alone, but, since she successfully completed her studies and a friend, they live their life together, they have the means to travel, live comfortably, etc.
Since then, in recent months, I have been alone, with state assistance linked to disabilities.

Everyone advises me not to work at the risk of losing all my aid, and having to pay all my health and other costs, linked to my disabilities and that, if my health declines, I find myself with nothing, with the loss of my job.

I don't lack the desire to get out of my situation, to resume my studies, but, at my age, I think it's too late, even for retirement.

I suffer from mental overload linked to the body, to taking medications, to fatigue, to pain, etc. My life was stolen from me.

I blame my parents and the State (which explains my antinatalism and other subjects that I don't really prefer to discuss so as not to upset people).

I had everything to succeed, I had made efforts to study... and my life was shattered, because of a student mutual (these corrupt organizations, which embezzled money from students, etc., and which went out of business, when the president removed them, to put all students on the general social system).

And yet I could have had time to finish my studies, in the past, if my health costs would have been correctly reimbursed and had the means to live better, a social status, and socially surrounded, to better support my health.
I was recently diagnosed with an incurable genetic disease, after a very long medical wandering, which explains a large part of my disabilities.

People criticize me for my character, but when I see such injustices, and it doesn't just affect me, and I have to put up with it, accept it, it's difficult to stay calm, not anxious,... the more I suffer from my size, my physical appearance.

I can't find love, who would want me, in these conditions. I stay alone. My father has his life too, my father who beat him a lot when he was younger. I do not know what to do? CTB? Voluntary disappearance (knowing that my health will not follow)?

Honestly I would have preferred to be stupid, so as not to see my shitty life, it's not a gift to have high IQ intelligence, just to have all the consciousness, to just see your body go to pieces without being able to do nothing, not being able to change anything in a shitty society, a shitty humanity... Even if there are rare people who are capable of kindness, of listening, of empathy...",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yeah, definitely pleased for my niece but I guess seeing her go through the ages and flashing back to what I was like/doing when I was those same ages, is really hard.
I am so sorry to hear all that you have and are still going for. I know it's not the same, but I can relate to the intellectual side to an extent. I keep getting told by professionals that it's rare for someone like me, with the extent of mental 'illness' and background, to be able to work at all. I get comments all the time from MH people that talk down to me when they first meet me, and then after a while say things like 'You're actually intelligent' - it's so offensive. I'm not the most intelligent person in the world but it's disgusting how many people expect you to be incompetent and an idiot just because you have a mental health condition. I was never able to work until the past 3-ish years, where I managed to get my degree and force myself into work. I have struggled so much with it and now I've had to go part time. However, that means financially I have to rely on some savings I have to make up the shortfall (I don't have lots of savings, but yes, I am thankful to have some at least). The welfare people say I'm only entitled to a ridiculously small amount of money which doesn't even cover the cost of petrol to get to my work. Ironically, if I work slightly less hours still, I'd be entitled to a lot more!! I don't want to cut it down further, I want to work and use my brain but currently my MH is beating my ass and I've had to go sick completely just now. I don't know what I'm going to do financially this month.

Like you, sometimes I wonder if I were 'stupid', would I be happier because I wouldn't overthink so much, care so much and even see the carnage that is my life. More often than not lately, you will hear me muttering or screaming 'I don't want to be in my head, I don't want to think, feel, be conscious!'. I've even begged doctors to sedate me, it's hell.",2587322,2587374,,,,,,,,,,,
,2587950,alltoomuch2,"Jul 7, 2024 at 3:58 AM","just to say, I'm in the UK and was under a MH team who could only give me 12 sessions, but my mental health practitioner realised halfway or so through (with the intervention of a crisis team I have to say), that it wasn't going to get fixed and now I'm under the care of the CMHT, who are much more skilled, for as long as I need. Yeah I'm still on here, fine-tuning methods for CTB, but I'm only 3 sessions in with the CMHT so who knows?.....
AND absolutely I experience this, even though I never wanted kids and I even get envious when people talk about their kids because it makes me feel like a failure, a lesser mortal, even worse than I already do. I avoid most people now. I have no friends because the ones I thought I had weren't there when I needed them. I can't bear those bloody things people post about ""remember you got through all your bad days so far"" and want to scream at them ""But I don't want any more of those bad days. I can't do it any more"". That's why I always and only come here for company. If I interact with anyone outside Sasu it's for their benefit to reassure them I'm still here (not that they care about me as I am, more about the symbol of ""sister"" ""daughter"" etc). The stupid thing is, when people are going out having fun, enjoying what they're doing, I don't want their actual life, I just want the peace and happiness they seem to have, that I never, in 61 years, experienced. I'm going to give my new mental health team a chance because I don't think I've ever had any proper help before, just talking type stuff which is useless once you've done it once. But I stay here for company and information about methods because if this last MH team don't help me enough to feel peace and joy, I'm out of here.

I was assessed by the Complex Emotional Difficulties Team who said they could give me C-PTSD DBT therapy. However, 3 days later, they called and said they weren't going to offer me anything. I am 'well-known' to the MH team (CMHT) and they know how complex my situation is, they've just ignored it for so many years, that now they have been forced back to try and help me, there is no funding for anything in the NHS. I have a care-coordinator (CC) with the CMHT and I meet her once a week, or fortnight. She's ok, but she can't provide therapy. She basically just checks in with me and does things like arrange appointments with the psych or whatever.

I am currently with the crisis team (home treatment team), and as much as I can't afford to believe or hope in anything they say, they did just 'mention' to me that there was potentially the option to apply for funding in a grant thing they have for people who have tried everything else and need therapy/help that the NHS can't provide (basically pay for you to go private). Now, I'm taking this with a hefty dose of salt because if I allow myself to feel hopeful and then it all goes to shit, I will not recover. On the flip side, if there is a fund that I can access, it pisses me right off that all these people/teams/crisis teams have been sitting on it for so long despite seeing how much I've been suffering.

But this time they were instrumental in getting me bumped up from IPBT to CMHT. So I really really hope that you can get that funding. I suppose we can hope that the new government may introduce things like this (they were talking about using private to cut the waiting lists until they can sort it out long term) but how long will it take?

My CMHT can't do the C-PTSD DBT therapy themselves, which is why they referred me to the complex emotional difficulties team (another, wider part of the team).

IPBT is the Integrated Place Based Team. It's a lower level secondary mental health service with mental health practitioners, peer support workers, social prescribing and that sort of thing. They are one-to-one and they come out to you, and they do offer some interventions, but the staff are less qualified and are more limited in therapies. The new government weren't my first choice either although I was desperate to get rid of Rishi ""sick note culture"" Sunak and his treacherous cronies.

I'm sorry for not being able to hold back my permanent anger and for being trashy, for being brutal in my words, I prefer to warn you in advance of the rest of my message.

I prefer to repeat, I don't want to hurt anyone, that is, physical, material harm, I just want to hurt myself and shock public opinion, and that everything remains legal. CTB is not illegal in most countries in the world, nor the way of CTB, as long as it does not involve other people or their property.

When I live, when I see my rotten body, my childhood destroyed, that I have been harassed, humiliated, inferiorized... I think of demolitions of buildings or cars.

They stole my height (I would have liked to be tall, like everyone else), they robbed me of the possibility of being able to study, because of my health, when my brain was largely capable of long studies, they robbed me of my dignity, they robbed me of my beauty (lack of care)...

I would like CTB in a peaceful way, but I would like my body (once dead, the soul gone) to be destroyed in a violent, punitive way, especially towards my father and all my childhood city, see all my country!

I keep seeing videos of demolitions of cars, buildings, ... it's so enjoyable when I think of what I would like to do with my body, the way it could be destroyed, this shitty body who destroyed my life and who makes me suffer all the time. It would be so enjoyable to shock the people who destroyed my life, and my country, to change its laws and better protect children or even prevent some parents from having children.

It would be so enjoyable to shock people to change mentalities, even at school. I'm tired of constantly seeing abused children, destroyed adults, suffering, misery, abused, tortured, destroyed animals... seeing the entire planet ransacked by beings supposed to be "" intelligent"", ""endowed with reason"".

I would like to shock the pro-lifers who persist in always refusing all peaceful CTB, MVA, Euthanasia, abortions, LGBT rights...

Every day passes, every day my anger grows stronger. Until when? How will it crack?

I just wanted to vent that anger, and those thoughts that I kept in silence since my childhood.

I'm sorry if I offended people who had nothing to do with it here. It was not my intention. I wanted to get the reaction of people here.

In this forum where I finally have the right to evacuate my thoughts without criticism and without being forced to self-censor, in political correctness.
Anyway, I'm afraid it's not going to change anything in society. People will continue to have children when they are unable to be good parents. I think humanity will continue to destroy animals, the planet... I think people will continue to procreate even though they know they are going to have handicapped, future dwarf person, future midget,... Who has bullied, rejected...

The only thing possible is to evacuate anger, without effects, or to continue to suffer. It's the Asperger extreme consequences.

I hope, in any case, that once CTB, my life story will be publicized. That my body and my knowledge (books, inventions... for example) will end up in ashes, so that no one can benefit from inheritance, to make profit, to appropriate my work, in particular intellectual.

I will decide what I will allow to keep, and it will be open source, as is the case with Linux. No one can own it, it's everyone's.
My parents are totally responsible for my size, especially at the genetic level, but also for having refused to treat me, while the doctors told them that I was not going to grow without medical treatment.

In addition, the doctors told my parents that their mistreatment, the deplorable hygiene, the often rotten food, the expiry date, etc., made me sick, that my illnesses stopped my growth! Doctors, especially school doctors, could do nothing because the law in my country gives absolute power to parents and families.

Do not forget that it is also the fault of my country which defends a family policy, gives generous allowances especially when you have a large family. That justice practically does not exist, for lack of budget, laziness, corruption. To go and say that it's nobody's fault is to speak too quickly without really knowing, unfortunately.

So yes, there can be bad births because of nature which has decided so, despite the efforts of parents, doctors, and the authorities of certain countries (who want good for the children for example). I can cite orphan genetic diseases, undetectable disabilities, etc.

But, obviously, in my country, nothing is done to ensure that only good parents can procreate or adopt. Nothing is done for the animal cause. Nothing is done for security. And, even worse, teachers and school principals are attacked by 10-year-old children! Again my country defends the parents of thug children.",1939531,,,,,,,,,,,,

I posted this thread because I have this impression, more and more tenacious, of being stuck living, in prison, in pain, both physical and psychiatric, and that it is more and more impossible to die by peaceful means!

I just wanted to know if other people had the same thoughts, the same cravings for CTB like this, and why.

But my will still remains to die peacefully! It would be cool to get N everywhere in the world, to benefit from assisted suicide (VAD), whatever the reasons, provided you are determined! It would be cool to be able to benefit from euthanasia for all people who are incapable of CTB or have a VAD (assisted suicide), whatever the reasons, because a suicide can be revoked at any time by the person. -even if she changes her mind, unlike euthanasia which can begin when the person changes her mind (but remains possible if suicide is not), the aim being to respect the wishes of the person, the principle of ultimate freedom.

But the pro-lifes push me to express my violent thoughts!!!!!

Who doesn't want to crack, flip out, when everyone tries to keep him alive, insults him when he wants to die, rejects him, to end up on his own,..., and at the same time time, people torture him, make fun of his physique, that the person remains poor by his health, that everyone prevents him from alleviating his sufferings in his life (care too expensive, painkillers prohibited, inaccessible...) , and especially when the person is badly born, handicapped, with physical illnesses, mental illnesses, or both, etc!!!!!

Who doesn't want to break down, flip out, when you're judged to be too much in society, treated like an outcast, useless, cowardly, not brave, rejected, etc., and at the same time, to your will to die, that everyone still insults you, judges you, calls you a coward, not brave, because you just want to die, to respect the wishes of the shitty society to get rid of a useless person, too much for the company!!!

The human is totally incomprehensible, stupid, proud, aggressor, and this stupid desire to be a hero to judge anyone who is inferior to himself. I rather think that society loves to criticize, and that if you are born badly, you suffer criticism, rejection, whatever you do in life or death!!!!

And we wonder why some people want the return of eugenics, of a license to procreate, of a license to be a parent... it's because, quite simply, it's better to be born well, this society of shit will never accept different people, who don't fit their stupid standards!!!

Being fearless can make you impulsive. Fear is what makes people use meticulous methods . I don't think fear makes you pro-life. It's just part of life.

If I wasn't raped and bullied when I was younger I wouldn't be suicidal and depressed and my life wouldn't be ruined academically,socially, financially. While my friends are all out having fun I'm here in my room drinking a can of beer I found with dust on it in the back of the cupboard because I'm not allowed to leave and get alcohol because I'm suicidal and addicted. So I'm so desperate to feel ok I'm drinking it even though I hate the taste of beer and I usually go for vodka.

If I was never raped or bullied I imagine my life would be so different. Maybe I could drink normally with my friends maybe my GCSE's would've been better and I couldnve gotten into a better college course. And been able to get a job without being exploited or judged.

A lot of them don't seem to care. Some of the bullies are still mean to me years later . A few have apologised but ig some people don't change.

I sometimes with I could hurt them the way they could hurt me. I wouldn't but I think about how satisfying it would be to beat them up like they did to me. Ruin their reputation and any self love and happiness they have like they did to me. I don't want them to be suicidal like me but traumatised enough that they hate living yk. That they thing about how I ruined their life.

Maybe I'm fucked up for thinking that way but I hate that their life is so perfect. They are so happy and popular and have jobs and go to college in a good course got straight A's on their GCSES have an easy life. It drives me insane. In year 9-11 I got sent to a special needs school because I was really suicidal and mainstream didn't want to adress the issues. In the Special school I was sort of forgotten about. I could barely call it a school. They didn't teach me anything.

I get so angry at the fact I wasn't taught becuse I didn't even have a chance and getting good grades. I also think about how nice it would be to get back at those teachers they also caused me lots of trauma because they neglected me and let me get hurt by students. Or hurt me themselves because other people were having issues in the same room so they would restrain me instead of them because it's easier.

I daydream about going back there and attacking them. I would never do this. But I just lately have been in such a dark place. I want to die. I'll never be able to get back at those people. They will live a long happy life and I'm gonna be a drug addict and homeless by next year if I'm not dead by then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is a relatively common topic on SaSu, as it has gotten increasingly difficult to do and I suspect that within a year or two, it will be banned altogether. Still, it's not impossible; I recently succeeded in obtaining SN by ordering it online and getting it delivered via Canada Post without any hitches -- no welfare checks or issues at customs (I am in Quebec for reference). However, if you've read the rules of the site, you'll know that sharing or requesting sources is not allowed, so finding such a source can be a complicated and long endeavour.

Another issue that often comes up is acquiring an antiemetic, which is uniquely challenging in our country due to regulations on the import of prescription medication, and can be even harder than acquiring the SN itself.

Given this, I would not put all your eggs into the SN basket. Are there any other methods you have looked into?

,2592979,idoticbrainstorming,"Jul 11, 2024 at 3:03 PM","I've had suicidal thoughts since about 11 years old and first attempted suicide when I was 12 because of bullying and PTSD from being raped as an 8 year old both of which lead me to have extreme anxiety and depression so suicide felt like the best option.


I have had help on and off for years have tried antidepressants and the self help things that you're supposed to do but nothing helped. There's been times on and off over the past few years where things have gotten ""better"" and I've not been struggling as much but even then if any minor inconvenience would happen my mind would immediately jump to suicide. Now my life is the worst it's ever been.

I've become addicted to alcohol and nicotine and haven't been able to have any in a while or not much because ive been forced to stop because one time I got really drunk and attempted to take my own life and was hallucinating. This is tough because especially with the alcohol for a while I was getting drunk daily because it was helping me deal with my depression and PTSD. And I went from that to cold turkey no alcohol. I'm back to being suicidal. I don't think there will ever be a time I'm not suicidal no matter what I do.

And I find it hard to believe that anyone who is suicidal can ever fully recover. I feel like when you've gotten to the point where you're so done with life you want to kill yourself there's no recovering from that. You're permanently broken. People who say they've recovered from being suicidal of course I'm happy for them but I feel like they are either delusional or lying and will be suicidal again soon or are suicidal and covering it up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do suicidal thoughts ever go away again once they are manifested in our brains for many years, even after a successful recovery?

,2592995,Eyler,"Jul 11, 2024 at 3:23 PM","In all opinions of mine, I see no issue in why you think that way— even I can say so myself that I doubted whether people do actually recover in general and in my choice of words I would say Yes, Maybe but it has to be in a way that they have been damaged less painful than others (obviously less trauma does not equal that you can't suffer worse than the ones that have conquered worse).

I would also personally that it can be possible with the help of people they are close with, which type of therapist you meet and what type of things YOU DO in order to recover. Most people who try to recover never actually the chance in fully helping themselves and their mistakes. They go to therapy and don't listen. Though other than that It can also be therapy in general just being ass because I can promise you there is Many out there that DON'T actually help in the first place.

I would say it really depends with almost everything in your life, mental state, trauma, friendships and relationships, current state of emotion and if you seeking help, etc.

I would also like to say that I dearly feel bad for your progression in recovery only to worsen.. which all I could do is wish you the best in my regards and hopes of you to find a better light around to fill you well. I'm sorry for all the things you had to go through, which I can fully understand because I been in similar circumstances.

Honestly— even with help, I feel like some people are just destined to not fully seek well enough to be able to be better. I say that people eventually go back to their roots, to get better and fall again— and the cycle continues.

I'm not sure, I'm no expert. Just someone who observes.

People here tend to be at their wits end and have lost a lot of hope regarding recovery. I'll give you my perspective as someone who I think has had similar issues as you from your post. I won't go into a whole lot of detail here since it can be triggering for some, but feel free to dm me once you've unlocked those permissions if you want a more in depth discussion. I am 24. I've also been suicidal since I was 12, and I was sexually abused for about 15 years since I was 7, possibly younger & I just can't remember. That and other instances with aggressive men gave me CPTSD. I'm also diagnosed with GAD, BPD, TRD, and my therapist thinks I may have Pure O OCD. I've been addicted to nicotine, alcohol, and prescription drugs all as ways to escape my own brain and depression. I've now spent half my life battling depression and suicidal ideations, and all the antidepressants and self help skills never seemed to work. I'm now on my seventh antidepressant & it doesn't really feel any different than the others. There were periods where I felt I had recovered though and would go maybe six months without feeling any suicidal ideations, but they always seemed to come back. I think it's impossible to recover when your life circumstances are working against you & your thoughts consume you. However, if mental health is the biggest barrier, I think recovery can be possible. I've recently started Spravato, and a lot of my thoughts from the CPTSD & BPD have quieted. I am still suicidal bc of life circumstances, but if I was able to change those I know I wouldn't be suicidal anymore. Sometimes just finding the right treatment can change a lot for your mental health. It's a fuck ton of work, but recovery isn't a delusion",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's not as easy to pull off as it sounds the rule of three days without water is when you're subjected to exposure. Not when you're in a comfortable environment and protected from the elements. I've gone up to 5 days without any water before. From my understanding I wouldn't have been in much danger until day 7.

The thing is : There will be a point where you will be too weak to move from your bed, but your body still needs to do it's thing (urinate and defecate).

But, on the other hand, I have a history of losing a lot of weight mainly by starving and restriction in a disordered sense, which might provide some level of ""practice"" and another motivation to not eat on top of dying from starvation. I'm also kind of desperate because unless I find an illegal website I can't legally purchase a firearm.

There are circumstances that get in the way like extreme hunger. I have caffeine pills, a lot of water, some fiber/diet pills, and soda where I live, but of course those might only last for a couple of weeks to quell hunger before things go in to binge urge territory.

When things get very rough, honestly, next step is the handcuff route (going to purchase those ahead of time). I'll tell you while it could be successful, it won't be easy. If you can find another way, I would rather that be the route in place of total cessation of food.

I once didn't eat for 5 days but had liquids. The first day is a bit painful because your stomach hurts when it wants food. There's some cramps but if you get over it, it'll calm down on the second day, I guess. From then on, you'll only have pain for short moments - but remember I was still drinking.
If I didn't have any liquid intake, I think it would've been much worse.

A hunger strike is not even considered suicide and if you are going down, why not go down protesting. It's a constitutionally protected form of protest in the United States and globally recognized as a human right. Even by the likes of Vladimir Putin! Everyone here has a good reason to protest. I'm going to try again. I just went 7 days in June but got tempted by food in a moment of weakness and ate. You have to be in the right frame of mind and have the right logistical situation but it can be done. The hardest part is not drinking anything. I have done much research on this and there are so many variables it's hard to estimate from individual to individual how long it will take. There have been cases where people have died in as little as 3 days on completely dry hunger strike. Usually that would be someone in poor health already. And then there's Sharmila. She has the all time hunger strike record. 16 years and she is still alive today. She ended her hunger strike a few years ago. I don't want any part of that record. My personal record is 6 days completely dry. When I did 7 days in June and got weak and tempted by kosher food it was semi-dry and I think I might have been close because of the extreme heat but I obviously didn't have the right logistical situation if someone put kosher food in front of me. You need to seclude yourself really. Away from any well meaning people who might do something like that. It's hard but I gotta try again.

I am planning to use the cherry pit method as it is fairly simple, I just can't find a straight answer on how to do this online. First of all, wherever I look, the answer I find is always different. Some sources I find say you need just a few, some say about 30, some say about 60, and some even say I would need about 588 cherry seeds. I also know it varies based on the type of cherry I use, and the package on my cherries says they are sweet cherries, which I read tends to have less cyanide than most other types. But I can't figure out how much cyanide, so I can't do the calculations to figure how much would be fatal.

Never thought about it on the first attempt. Everyone's different though, and I suppose it depends on what goes on between attempts. My life was quite nice in between attempts so maybe I got a renewed perspective that someone with far more 'intense' mental illness/apathy towards life would not feel, resulting in me re-evaluating what my suicide would mean, while they would have kept up their acceptance of death due to their unchanging stance/feelings towards life.",2593224,,,,,,,,,,,,

WHY are Suicide Rates Going Up All Around the World?,2593160,KuriGohan&Kamehameha,"Jul 11, 2024 at 6:08 PM","Agree wholeheartedly with this. Maybe a decade ago, the internet wasn't as toxic to the mind as it is now, especially when the net sphere was full of niche hobby forums and chatrooms as opposed to social media and internet presence being a requirement for many workplaces and aspects of life.

When I was growing up, the main thing the people around me used the internet for was printing off directions from the map, games, auctions, and forums. It seemed like the culture of the internet as a whole had more soul to it, while now the entire thing is a giant billboard ad for the influencer of the day, all homogenised, corporate slop. Paradoxically, things meant to bring people together like social media actually tore the fabric of society apart.

There is so much hostility and loneliness in the world today. While I think other factors do certainly play a role in why more people are miserable today, I think the lack of socializing and lack of community/social cohesion is probably one of the key reasons, if not the biggest contributor imo. Not only do people stay indoors more, don't go out as much, and stick to solitary activities, but it seems like many younger people especially in Gen Z are completely addicted to the internet and have very little regard for other people unless it's a trendy cause on social media to be flaunted for clout.

People don't know their neighbours anymore in many western countries, they don't know the names and faces of the fellow humans in their communities, everyone is a stranger to each other at best, or a potential danger at worst. Promoting an atomised, individualised society as the way to live ultimately ends in palpable isolation. Nowadays, many people have the attitude that those around them are not even entitled to the slightest bit of kindness, everyone is trying to ""get theirs"" so to speak and acts as if the wellbeing of others is inconsequential.

Not only are there very few ways to organically meet people in the real world, but if you do manage to meet new people and try to make friends, the social dynamics are so fucked that there's a high chance nothing will come out of that initial interaction. Because of social media, people want to present a glamorized, perfect life to the public, it's either all picturesque travel and food photos or sarcastic memes on everyone's pages, there is never any vulnerability, sincerity, or depth. It's all surface level nonsense most of the time. Making close friendships can be a herculean task.

Despite there being such an influx of loneliness creeping up on adults now, there is also still so much absurd judgement from those who do have their social needs met, who pretend this is not a widespread societal problem and always blame the individual. Oh, you just need to try harder and get out more, just go to a gym, take a class, you're not trying! Yet, those people dishing out the advice usually have long term friendships since their school days and robust family support. They don't realize how completely isolated many adults are once they leave education behind enter the workforce.

With social media one click away, every interaction can be scrutinized, filmed, documented, and dissected under a microscope. One post or interaction can have disastrous consequences. It's not unheard of for people to get photographed having a wild night out and get sacked if someone takes a picture of the employee playing beer pong or wearing a revealing outfit. Live to work, with no outlet for relaxation and play. Conversations, photos, videos, etc can all be leaked at any time if someone hates you enough. There's no real privacy, and everyone is expected to morph into a bland professional persona at a certain stage in their life, with no personality other than being a corporate drone, with a faux morally righteous persona.

It's no wonder life loses it's meaning for so many people nowadays, when the expectation is to work and then sit alone all the time. I saw an extremely depressing post the other day where a man who just hit his 30s and graduated from a post grad degree asked if he could still attend some university societies for hobbies after his graduation (as there were no other groups in his area for certain activities) and many commenters jumped the gun accusing him of being a ""nonce"" and a freak, telling him he needed to grow up. If the idea of a 30 year old being ""too old"" to have any hobbies except going to the gym- or even talking to other adults in a shared interest group- is seen as creepy and scandalous, we have lost the plot as a society.

So many people have no real friends or connections, no one to count on, and then if you go online lamenting this all you get is the canned response that there's no loneliness epidemic, you just need to go to the gym more and embrace staring at your four walls. Also, there are unprecedented rates of Autism with the numbers climbing every year. For each one of us that gets diagnosed, comes the realization that there will be a lifetime of social struggles and rejection. Suicidal ideation and self harm is extremely common for us autistic people.",2592888,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tie a heavy weight to yourself, crawl/slide into deep water. Go somewhere you can be certain no-one will find you.

Drink toxic household chemicals (bleach, ammonia, etc) somewhere nobody will find you.

(Note: I strongly advise against mixing chemicals unless you're completely aware of what will happen. The aforementioned bleach and ammonia can make a toxic gas, but it might just harm you. That said- drinking bleach can absolutely kill you, many people accidentally poison themselves that way.)

I don't know the mechanics of Cyanide by cherry seed since this is the first I'm hearing of this - but I just hope you understand that ingestion of Cyanide will lead to some very agonizing final moments. Highly effective, but agonizing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, cherry pits are way cheaper than Potassium Cyanide, and I'm not exactly doing well with money right now, not to mention I don't live alone and I think anyone would be surprised to see cyanide at their doorstep if I don't get there first. And SN is really hard to obtain. I also have about 150 cherry pits saved up, when I get to 200 ill toss it in a blender and dilute the powder in water and drink it on an empty stomach. I'm not exactly sure if it works though, especially considering how unclear it is online how much will kill you. When I do drink it, I will make a post, no long life story or anything, just a short post explaining that if I live I will make another post letting anyone considering this method know that I survived.

Cherry Pit CTB Method Help?,2591173,Scythe,"Jul 9, 2024 at 10:25 PM","This is unreliable, the commonly edible plants are not going to be reliable otherwise everyone would be using them to die. You might be able to find some kind of documentation on how much cyanide is in the pits somewhere? I'm not great with research, so I can only find 1mg of cyanide per kg you weigh to kill, and 0.7 of cyanide per gram of apple seed. How reliable this is, I don't fucking know. The wikipedia doesn't talk about it.

If you're going to do this make sure to grind the pits into dust first otherwise they will pass straight through your digestive system with only a little bit of cyanide being absorbed. I also suggest getting bitter almonds, those might have a higher concentration in cyanide because they are controled plants in some places. This will also be slower than consuming a cyanide pill because you are absorbing the poison slower. So instead of a few minutes of suffering before falling unconcisious this could be a few hours. For this I can really only suggest to fast for 8 hours then eat the seeds before sleeping.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Edit: I just watched the video from The Action Lab, he concludes that there is approximately 0.004mg of cyanide in two cherry pits, so you would need tens of thousands of cherry pits to kill you if he is correct about that, and he also claims that without the cherry, the pit can't release the cyanide at all.

Not the easiest way to go but in the United States it's a constitutional right and worldwide is recognized as a human right. So the psychiatric con artists have to back off. It's the 1 way that I know of that you can legally make a decision to die in the United States. Even Vladimir Putin recognizes this as a human right. I can't verify and don't know if it's true but 1 of my eastern European friends told me this. Navalny went on hunger strike. That's not how he died. Cause of death unclear but consensus opinion is Putin had him killed. Nadya and I am not going to try to spell her last name but she's the heroic chick from the band Pussy Riot. A Russian group really more than a rock band. Nadya wrote songs that were anti-Putin and anti-Russian govt and they were overt. Not vague open to interpretation. 1 of her lyrics translates to ""Putin pissed his pants"", for example. She got locked up on trumped up bs charges and served a couple years in Russian penal colony which they sent her to 1 of the very worst. She went on 3 hunger strikes during her incarceration. Putin was reportedly asked about these hunger strikes and said, ""If someone wants to protest me or my policies, I prefer they do so by hunger strike because if they die this way it saves me the trouble"". My only source for this is a bartender from Belarus but I can believe it. It sounds like something Putin would say. Brave Nadya is my hero and inspiration and there is a video in English you can watch on YouTube. Pussy Riot song called ""Making America Great Again"" is worth watching.

It's impossible to live on what social security pays me after they defraud me out of the Medicare premiums payments every month. Even if I was getting that money every month it's not enough to live on anywhere in America. It's only like $178 or thereabouts. That would only bring me up barely over $1200. The cost of living adjustment for 2024 was only 3.2 percent! With the inflation of today!! And it's been that way since I have been disabled. The COLAs never have kept pace with inflation. Now I am without any place to live at all, broke, and every step I take is more pain than most people could begin to tolerate.

"How do I effectively and painlessly CTB without my body paralyzing me to ""PRotecT"" me?",2589417,Cuecumber,"Jul 8, 2024 at 9:43 AM","I've tried to CTB several times, but failed due to my body physically paralyzing whenever I was about to stab myself in the heart. Due to this fact I turned to this site to get assistance on committing CTB and get method suggestions and tips as my psychological health is fucked to the point I'm unable to come up with anything.

I'd like for a CTB method suggestion to contain all these factors so I could avoid suffering even more than I need to in the future:

- Induce little to no brain damage
- 'Look' and be painless
- Be seemingly innocent for the unsuspecting eye and avoid as much legal trouble as possible (I'm in Finland so I'll get arrested if I'm caught with anything that could be used to harm self or others)
- Be something other than stabbing or anything similar so my body won't paralyze to prevent a painful experience
- Be easy to access (I have a budget of 50 euros at my disposal)
- Have no one else around at all, so no assist methods
-
- Most importantly and obviously, effective enough for me to CTB

(My exact motives for CTB isn't important. What is important to know is I'm not waiting forever while suffering in every way any longer. Keep in mind though that my reasoning for committing CTB is purely logical and is in no way even remotely associated with my feelings winning me over and that I've already lost everyone who actually helped and cared about me, so no one will mourn for my death because they loved me.

Fighting the usual suicidal thoughts and then losing the only friend I actually saw in real life.
Then getting long-covid on top of it. Didn't get the usual symptoms so everyone kept telling me it ""must be something else."" Despite being 'relatively healthy' and very active before I got infected. And afterwards only being able to lie in a dark, silent, room.
The endlessness of doctors letting me down. No one has an idea how to help me. No one really bothered trying either. Just started therapy after a 9 months waitinglist. But its already clear its not going to help with any long-covid symptoms. Tried a ssri but that made everything so much worse. Now trying to recover from that to get back to my baseline.
I am so tired of fighting my own body and mind, everyday, alone.

The sucky part about all this is that I couldn't even tell my friend here on SaSu because she is dealing with her own problems, and I am letting her down because I had promised we would partner if it ever came down to it but I am deeply terrified that if one of us were to survive the attempt, they would be in major trouble with the police, and they might call 911 and save the other.

Whether good or bad, they almost always torment me and make me sad. When good, it is usually about my girlfriend of seven years, a relationship I ruined. Every time there is a 'happy' memory it is a horrendous torturous reminder of what scum I am that destroyed it.
There are also many dark memories from dark times, like a war deployment some decades ago. Those seem more distant and anesthetized.

I guess I am more accepting of the things that were out of my control. Whereas anything that I could have done differently beats the hell out of me non-stop.

The memories visit me more in isolation. Which is where I've spent the best part of my time since the whole COVID adventure began. Soon about half a decade of isolation.

If you are young, have social skills, and zest for life please try and maintain healthy relationships. New positive experiences can help you put traumas forced upon you behind. But be wary, if you make any mistakes, it may haunt you more deeply down the road.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

So i'm bulimic, throwing up pretty much every meal daily. On good days i'll purge 1-2 times, normally it's 3, on days I can't control it it's 5-6 or more. Nondisordered people think im just choosing an extremely ineffective weight loss method and lecture me to ""diet normally"" or fucking hell ""love my body"" and im fucking sick of it because they don't get it at all. I'm addicted to binging and purging which is why i can't stop, but mainly, bulimia has more potential to be a fast killer than anorexia is (you know that infamous photo of the girl who died in front of the toilet purging?) and at this point i kind of hope my heart gives out during one of my purging attempts.
I think dying from bulimia will make it seem less of a suicide and more of an accident to my family. They'll think im some fat girl who died trying to get skinny.
I don't have other methods.. The only drugs i have access too is benadryl/dph and i know how ineffective and unpleasant that is. I'm too chicken to jump from somewhere high and I don't want to do it in public. I don't have access to firearms.
In the meantime it hasn't killed me, i still feel some of the effects throwing up everything i eat has. My bmi may be healthy but i still feel shaky and lightheaded from electrolyte imbalance and my period comes and goes. It's all ""validation"" that i'm unwell. Being physically healthy makes me feel like crap because ppl assume you are mentally healthy if your body is fine. Basically i struggle to get out of bulimia because it makes me feel valid while im alive and i know it could be my way out when the time comes.

,2561913,Broad604,"Jun 15, 2024 at 1:20 PM","Hello. This is my first post.

I am suffering from a highly unusual, currently unnamed medical condition (physical) that, without giving too much away, totally consumes between 2 and 4 hours of my life every day, and depending on if I have a ""good"" or ""bad"" day can ruin or at least seriously worsen an entire day. I have been suffering with this condition for almost 10 years now, and, particularly in the last 3 or 4 years, it has completely prevented me from living a normal life. It dominates everything. I can't plan anything without first taking it, and the several hours actively managing it takes every day, into account. My close family are only partly aware of the details, and very few of my friends know anything. I am genuinely amazed I have managed to maintain, at least outwardly, a relitively normal seaming life, though I do have to plan around my condition, so doing anything without at least 24 hours notice is difficult, and have managed to have relatively normal working life up until now.

Trouble is, I'm never going to get any better, I'm only going to worse, it already is. I realised about a year ago that I had somewhere between 1 and 3 years of ""viable"" life left before it simply becomes all consuming. I intend to live every day that I can before it simply becomes unbearable, before every day is a ""bad"" day. Then I'm going to die by my own hand. I have begun calling this day ""Oblivion Day"" (don't know why it just sounds dramatic).

As this as yet unspecified day draws closer, I have begun taking much greater risks, incuding using recreational drugs (cannabis helps with ""bad"" days, cocaine is nice on good days) but I am by no means any kind of addict, and spending much more heavily on vacations, etc. I no longer care if I am in debt, etc. Can't re-possess the assets of a corpse.

Firearms would be my prefered choice due to the reletive ease of use and high probabilty of success, but I live in Europe in a country in which guns are very rare (most police officers don't have guns here), and hard to get. Any suggestions of a high chance of success method would be very much appreciated, though due to my condition I would prefer it not to involve swallowing something, as this could turn a ""good"" day, my last ""good"" day, into a bad day, and I don't want to die feeling ill.

Thank you if you took the time to read this. This is genuinely the first time I have shared any information about my conditon with anyone but my Parents and a doctor.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But my point is that the motivations behind it are not about ""human rights"" or anything of the sort. Countries with assisted dying programs don't offer it due to compassion or empathy or respect for autonomy or any of that. It's done as a cost-saving measure.
First off: these policies are almost always implemented in countries with socialist healthcare systems. These systems rely on a limited government budget. If a procedure is expensive to perform, they do not benefit from the price paid by the patient, because the patient does not pay for their treatment. Rather, costly procedures put a dent in the government's budget, and are thus not important unless a greater tax revenue can be made off of saving that person.
This is why elderly people will, in America, spend their entire life's savings to live an extra 6 months. They don't see much value in their money anymore, but the medical companies do, so they're happy to perform whatever treatments they can. However, in these other countries, the same type of elderly patient would be recommended medical assistance in dying, because the input cost is not worth the tiny tax revenue.
This is why only those who are chronically ill ""non-contributors"" in society are recommended or approved for assisted dying. Because they would otherwise be a tax burden on society with routine hospital visits or drug prescription. So the government benefits from killing these people.

Anyway, my point is: assisted dying is great and it should be available in a less predatory form. But presently, the methods of assisted dying aren't supported by moral arguments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I think profiteering companies control too much legal power. However I think it could be changed in a different direction than socialism. If you're interested, read Human Action by the Austrian economist Hans Hermann Hoppe, and if you're really math-minded, check out some of Milton Friedman's work. On the topic of insurance and healthcare, ""Fraternal Societies and Social Services"" by David Beito is a good read. In a free market system (i.e. not the corporate lobbyist system in America), there is probably an even greater chance to have access to assisted dying, since there wouldn't be a government-sponsored one-size-fits-all solution.
Anyway, my main point is that everyone simply acts on incentives. The State doesn't necessarily work for the benefit of the people, it works for the benefit of the State. It just so happens that there's enough mutually beneficial overlap that citizens can co-exist with the State.

I conceded that these countries probably are not recommending death. My only statement is that the incentive exists to do so, in order to save tax budget. If it doesn't happen that much, great. But again, the incentive is there and I want people to think about incentives behind action.
According to incentives, socialized healthcare would allow people to die if it saves money, because it works on a limited budget and prefers quick and permanent solutions. Whereas corporatist healthcare forces people to live because it profits from recurring revenue and takes advantage of desperate people.
I appreciate efforts proving me wrong, though. My statements about other countries are speculation based on understanding of human incentives, not based on statistical evidence. So I accept that my expectations can be wrong about those countries.

I have been suffering so much. I've kept things inside me all my life. I can't keep it anymore, I was always sheltered and on the moments I tried to open up no one took me seriously. I am tired, really. Living just hurts so much. I think this year will be my last shot. I will try the last therapists, the last meds, the last churchs, the last hobbies, the last efforts to improve. If nothing works, well, we all know it don't we? My SN is about to arrive . And if I don't see improvement in sight, I think it will have to be it.

But do you wanna know the thing that schocks me the most, that is on my mind every night: I knew it all along, deep inside, I fucking knew it. Ever since I was a kid I knew deep down that I was different, I was depressed from a young age and I told myself: ""If I don't change it will be over for me in the future"". And do you wanna know what? I was right all along, I didn't change enough, and now I'm fucked.

This is it. I'm gonna try my best efforts, if nothing works I will make a post about my CTB.
Anyone suffering the same? I appreciate your attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I especially relate to that second part of your message, I've always been depressed since I was very young as well and the more years that passed the less I saw (and wanted) a life for myself.

I'm having lots of memories of childhood and early adulthood where the tides were turned and I let my circumstances dictate my future. I was to thin-skinned and stopped healthy outlets that could have turned into lifestyle careers instead of wage slavery and office work though I was also sabotaged. I feel like I'm being out maneuvered by fate if I don't fight vigilantly. I have lots of loose ends to tie up before I leave the world and it's going to take every thing I have to rally the energy to do that while feeling this way. On the other end of that there's the possibility that iI can new chapter. I hate the idea of my enemies having any satisfaction if I ctb and that also keeps me hanging around.

,2592771,alltoomuch2,"Jul 11, 2024 at 11:21 AM","Omg. Yes. I feel exactly like this. The MH people all exclaim how proactive I am and how hard I try. And none of them realise that's because this is my last chance. But part of me has given up and that's so not me. I'm just not the person I really want to be. I just want to help people and make them feel better but yet again today I've been reminded how I don't do that however hard I try because I'm too weird, look too unapproachable, too ugly, just not nice. And I've been like that all my life as long as I can remember. Shunned. People being obviously uncomfortable around me. Sad. Not understanding how to live this life that so many people seem to live so effortlessly. And yes I've struggled and had to get through it alone without telling anyone all my life. I can remember telling my mother only once ever that I wanted to Kms and what did she say? ""Go on then, jump"" and walked away. That was the only time until now I asked for help. And now I've asked for help and been trying so hard since October, hoping that eventually I will experience optimism and joy for once in my miserable useless life. But it's not working so far. I'll keep trying until they stop helping me I think. I'll practice the techniques. I'll take the meds. I'll do the ""enjoyable"" activities that aren't. But like you, I fucking knew this was my life and I've tried for 60 years, god knows I've tried, but I'm still me and I hate me. I just wish I could get SN but im in the UK and despite searching endlessly I can't get any. So I'll give MH services one more chance. But then it's night-night, or full hanging or whatever it's called, or Nytol (yes I know that's a bad way) or paracetamol (yes I know that's even worse), or train (yes the driver, I know, but is that worse than someone you know finding you hanging or night-nighted, really?). And I do feel for you. I so so feel for you. Because you seem to be in the same place, desperately trying to do the right thing, running out of options and ideas. And each day another slap in the face. Another body blow. Another slide further down the snake. And each time another part of you dies inside. And you're afraid to hope. And almost too tired to try any more. And desperate to reach out but if you do you know they'll try to persuade you of things that aren't true. ""It'll get better"". ""it's a temporary feeling"". But their like king canute trying to stop the sea coming in. I really hear you and I'm just so sad that there's someone else in the same mental pain that I'm in. So here is the biggest hug of understanding. I love you because like me you are giving it the last chance from the bottom of your reserves. And I truly hope it gets better for you.

Because of the burdensome nature of existence, I don't see any value in being enslaved in the decaying and harmful flesh prison that is the human body, existence truly is just a process of slowly dying all while one suffers to try and fufill needs in the process that were all futile and unnecessary in the first place. In fact all existence does is create problems there was never a need for.

2. Because in existence there is immense potential for suffering and this to me is why suicide is very rational. The non-existent cannot suffer, they have no need for anything, in fact ceasing to exist solves everything, yet as long as one exists there is no limit as to how much one can be tormented.
I'd always prefer the peace of eternal sleep over having the ability to suffer, in fact I find it such a horrific tragedy how life even existed at all. Consciousness is an abomination to me, and existence is just useless and meaningless suffering. It's like a virus how humans continue to impose existence just continuing this endless cycle of suffering and torment.
3. I don't see anything appealing about deteriorating from age in an existence that was very undesirable in the first place, in fact it terrifies me how a human can potentially exist for so long. Reaching very old age just sounds beyond hellish to me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

1. unbearable pain is possible as long as a sentient creature exists . every day they take that risk unbeknownst to them because imo most don't realize how bad pain can be and that it could happen to them any day. imo unbearable pain has to be avoided at all costs. .they call it ""unbearable "" because pain is so bad the victim can't bear it another second , can't tolerate it , it's intolerable. and the horror is that it could last a long time not just fleeting as most pleasures are.
2. Every human and other animal ages gets old decays. imo old age must be avoided at all costs also. that every animal gets old makes life bad.
3. too much labor for too little reward. high maintenence burdensome. daily suffering for no purpose. life is meaningless. the bad things outweigh the good.

,2583764,Liamm,"Jul 3, 2024 at 10:20 AM","1. My main reason is clinical anxiety/ptsd/depression/ocd. I was sexually assaulted by a close friend, and some other things happened. I literally freak out if I am around too many men, or even just in a room alone with one. And it only really got worse after going through treatment for a year. Nightmares are fun. And constant guilt tripping goes crazy.

2. Gender dysphoria, while in a straight marriage and religious. Speaks for itself. I refuse to look at mirrors or really take care of this body that I cant make myself love.

3. Isolation. Due to some of my wifes insecurities, I've had to cut off many childhood friends. And it is hard to spend time with the ones I have left due to the same fact. I've actually just given up on having friends. To expand on that, after having a certain close friend I made recently abuse me while I was drunk, I found it very hard to trust people. So I relied on my childhood friends, who I've literally seen grow up because I thought I could trust them. But due to my wifes insecurities of me being closer to them than her, I've been forced to cut them off.

3.5 This is an issue in the first place because I cant talk to her without being belittled or yelled at. I tried, for years, to explain that how she talks to me hurts my feelings. Every time she would either get angry with me/ argue, or play victim. And so, I gave up on having a close relationship with her. It never mattered that I controlled my words to the best of my ability, or that I never yelled at her, or that I tried my hardest to be as understanding. I simply felt unheard and uncared for. And I've told her in and out of couples therapy but no one but myself seems capable of change.

4. Bonus. She recently(few days ago) acknowledged all of this for once. And Im supposed to just accept this. After years and a long time of this, Im supposed to be ok with this. I don't want to open up to her, nor anyone else. Well, i don't have anyone else anymore. Regardless, Im done. I'm ""supposed"" to continue being a good husband after this, be a loving and functioning member of society. i'm done. Its like a few years too late. And im a fucking shitty husband for that.

Every single time she asked me to change something or do something I've done it without question. Everytime the couples therapist gave me a task or explained how I could be a better husband I did it. I would ask her regularly how I could be better, what she needed from me, how I could support her. And without question I would do it. Because I wanted to be a better man than my father, and my step father. Im not the best husband. I wouldn't even say Im a good husband but i tried my damn hardest. But it never mattered as there was always something new for me to start working on, because i am never good enough. Never enough. Im honestly convinced Im just the shittiest person in the world, married to an infallible woman. And im done.

That's why I want to kill myself. I miss my damn fucking friends. They were the best fucking people I've ever met. I don't give a damn that one was a witch and another one a lesbian. They were the best fucking people i knew-- and I've met many other religious people. Ill always love them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

1.climate collapse - the climate is changing to be completely unsuitable for human or other animal life. Seeing scores of people and animals died from extreme weather (heat waves/wet bulbs being a huge one), the coming food shortages and the general agony of a collective slow death.

2. Mass delusion and the madness of crowds - while everything in the natural world is going to shit, people and nations around the world are reverting back to tribalistic animals. Where the mass of people blame the others(often the minority of the society, but it also be the under class as well) instead of the greedy shit heads that sold out the world for cash and power(corporates and government). Often when things get materially rough in a real sense people collective huddle around a strong man that will promise them the world while telling the masses to do all matter of evil to the people that strong man deemed responsible and undesirables. Might and strength makes right rules the world while Reason, compassion and rationality draws it's last breaths.

3.mad max, brace new world,1984, etc- the people that will be left will live a life that make the series I mentioned above seem like Disneyland. A world full of famine, madness, sickness, despair and death. No place to go for clean food, water or air on the planet earth. Weather events that kills millions every year. And violent gangs rape and pillage what left until the planet globally reach a point where all life fall into permanent stillness.

Considering all that(and more) i see no real reason to stick around. Most of my close family is dead, no gf(yes yes I know I am not entitled to love, pls shut up) and I am too tired to socialize with friends I have left anymore.

,2592452,SomeManJuan1,"Jul 11, 2024 at 3:36 AM","I've made up my mind about what needs to happen, but the only thing preventing me right now is the fact that I'm worried I might fail. I'm worried that failure could leave me damaged or vegetative, or that it means I will have to deal with the guilt of knowing that my family know I tried to ctb, without the 'easy way out' of avoiding guilt by not being there. I guess I'm also worried that my attempt will be so painful or horrible that I will naturally try to stop myself and cause problems that way.

What I plan to do is hang myself. I have an office room in the house and on the outside of the door there is a pull-up bar that can definitely hold my weight (80kg). I will tie a rope around this with a secure hitch knot, then feed the rope over the door so it reaches into the room, closing the door as much as possible. Then of course the other end of the rope will be a noose, which I intend to fit around my neck (at the top of my neck, right underneath my jaw??) while standing on a chair, then simply step off of the chair.

I want to make sure this works quickly and effectively so I plan to put a plastic bag over my head before the noose, but I haven't seen many people talk about doing this so I don't know if it is an effective thing to do? I think that I will also cut my wrists at the radial artery and make sure I have lots of towels and things under me, but I am apprehensive because I have never cut myself before.

The reason I want to hang myself over the door like this is to hide my body and delay access to me. I'll do this while my family is out and will leave a note at the bottom of the stairs warning them to not come up even though I know they will but it will mean that at least my wife will know to not let the children up. I know my wife will of course want to get me down but if I am on the other side of the door she won't be able to open the door if I am hanging behind it with the rope fastened on the outside. Hopefully the tension on the rope will mean that she can't undo the hitch knot. I will also make sure that all of my tools and knives will be inside the room with me so she can't cut the rope.

So by doing this it will buy me more time because she won't be able to stop me straight away and will instead have to either call 999 or fetch a neighbour which will take more time and would hopefully mean that whoever comes to help will also stop her from seeing me. My plan is therefore that this will give me more time to make sure it is definitely done and also to stop my wife and kids from seeing me. The only risk is that she might try to climb out to the windows and break her way in but I don't think she'll risk doing that with the kids in the house because they would come up to see what she's doing.

I am 100% certain that living is not an option and that this would be the best thing for everyone. It is just frustrating that I am scared about it going wrong or scared that it will hurt too much that I will stop myself. Is there anything else I can do to improve the hanging process to make it more quick and effective?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it took so long, like 3-4 months…
I wanna know if there is any way (healthy or unhealthy) to lose weight faster than that…
So my question is, fasting for how long between meals and how much exercise can I do to fasten my chances of losing the weight? (Also used to do lax and can do it again but idk I dont wanna end up with a bag to poop with )
Also can I do this without purging? Have bulimia as well, but idk I just dont wanna ruin my body lol (ironic isnt it)

I cannot speak for everyone who is suicidal, it's not possible for me to.

""There is a part of you that doesn't want to die because you want to get better.""

My rebuttal to this sentiment is that every single person has a survival instinct inherently in them. It's just there because we're human beings, and I don't think for some people it implies much beyond that. That's just a biological design.

I know it's not intentional for people who say it, but just personally when I hear or see it, it feels invalidating. Maybe I don't want to have to die, but I want death. I hold the perspective that death is freedom, whether the afterlife that I personally believe in and envision waits for me, or even just nothing at all, no consciousness, nothing. Ceasing to exist or higher existence.

It's like being in a calmest form of yourself where you don't feel suffering or any form of pain.

Though, I understand those people who are afraid of the act of committing suicide, and It is not only because of survival instinct or fear of death. The thought of leaving those people you loved can be a deterrent of committing suicide. There is also a deep desire to search for purpose or meaning of life which makes dying felt like not worth it.

I realized from talking to people here, that there really is some kind of stark experiential divide between us and other people.

It almost feels like the there's an untranslatable language barrier. And utterances such as this, ""you dont actually want to die,"" are the byproduct of the communication breakdown.

"Sentiment I disagree with: ""You dont actually want to die""",2585514,mark404,"Jul 4, 2024 at 9:41 PM","I think the psychology behind survival instinct is that the human brain is inherently addicted to living. Just existing gives pleasure to some part of the brain, people just don't notice the pleasure exists. I think survival instinct, fear of death, etc. are really a fear of missing out on potential pleasure in the future, which disappears when one acknowledges that life is not worth living anymore, that there is no point to existing anymore.
I personally feel like I float in between both states. Some days, I feel like there is no point in living anymore because there's nothing fun to do anymore, and my fear of death subsides a bit. On other days, I feel strong SI because there is a somewhat fun short term goal I am trying to accomplish.
This theory may explain why elderly people are often fine with dying, since they already lived life to the fullest and do not have any regrets. They do not have any more potential pleasure to miss out on because they have already done everything they wanted to do. It may also explain why many parents (not saying all) would die for their children in an instant, since when they die, they are trading their potential future pleasure in exchange for the survival of their children. The brain probably sees this trade as profitable, since natural selection would probably have selected humans who die for their children rather than humans who do not.",2584919,,,,,,,,,,,,

I get you though, that death is at least ""freedom"" from having to experience constant suffering. I think thats the most painful realization when I got seriously suicidal, is that, for me, I just want to experience a decent level of peace and enough joy to make life worth living. But death isn't an experience at all. Its part of the reason I'm here.

Even though I don't think its likely or even possible for me, I've felt the experience of peace and joy, even though they were such brief periods and the times I've genuinely experienced them I could count on my fingers. Peace is so difficult that it surprises me when I feel just ok for a few minutes of the day. But I know what that peace and joy feels like, and it pains me so much that its so rare for me, and I see others be able to live with normal levels of it. It feels like a party that I wasn't invited to, but the party is everyday, and I'm just watching it from my bedroom window. Seeing people smile, knowing what its like, but not being able to feel it, or even touch it. Wishing my mind didn't work against me in every way, to make it impossible for happiness or peace to settle here. It always tells me that my keys are in the past, and things woulda been different if… but having seen this movie over and over, there is no woulda been different if, because no matter how hard I try to change, or do something different, or listen to my mind, I end up in the same spot-still convinced that if I only did something else things would've been better and I would've been ok.

My mind taunts me by giving me the feeling of peace and what I could of felt when I imagine my past actions differently, but because it didn't go like that, my brain constantly berates me, and beats out any bit of peace or semblance of joy in the present. It doesnt allow me to be present. No matter how much I try. It compares constantly, or ruminates, or imagines and ideal past, or criticizes me, or tells me how fucked up qnd horrible I am. I live with the worst critic that could possibly be made, and its my brain. I can't escape it. It knows my thoughts. It is my thoughts. Its my CPU, its the pilot of my plane. Every single action, decision, thought and experience, it pervades and destroys. I've been trying to change the behaviours and external circumstances, not fully grasping, that I don't think it fucking matters what I do, my brain won't be content, it will always doubt, worry, tell me that I'm doing it wrong, make me feel like what I have is bad, that I should do this or do that and I'll feel better, that I'm not good enough, that she's not good enough, that things would be better if…why did u think that was the right decision? Wtf is wrong with u? Etc etc. just pure chaotic noise, and constant pain.

But I think life is a beautiful experience for a less disordered and dysfunctional brain. I've felt it for moments, and although so few and far between, like once you've had a spiritual experience, you know it exists, you know its there. I know life is worth it for many, I'm just locked out of heaven, a normal less disordered brain is heaven compared to this hell. I wish things were different. I so badly want to join the party, I so badly want to live, but you can only take so much of a beating, so much intense disappointment, so much internal horror, before it just becomes inhumane.

I view my experiencer/observer (as in my conscience) separate from my mind that includes my disorders, dysfunction and inner critic. It becomes inhumane for the experiencer or observer to be in an unrelenting horror film for almost its entirety of experience. For me, it doesn't feel like much of a choice. Like the 9/11 jumper who leaps from the window to avoid dying from the flames, and those that wait helplessly waving their towels for a rescuer that never comes. I'm the observer, forced into having to make a humane choice. I'm burning alive and I'm nearing my threshold. I don't want my life to have been mainly pain. I dont want it to end the way its always been. But I'm not in control of the movie, I'm just the observer.",2584919,,,,,,,,,,,,

You actually just want your life to be better- well- duh. People turn to suicide when they can't see a way of feasibly making their life better- surely?

The most hardcore promortalists will argue that there's nothing good about life itself. That life itself is the problem. But- that still boils down to the same problem- they can't make existence/ life work, or feel appealing to them.

I think it's the same problem with other pro-life slogans like- 'suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.' Both statements assume that all life's problems can be fixed to a point where a person will be content to live. I simply don't think they always can be. Plus- the person needs to have the motivation themselves to turn things around.

Where I'd agree personally is- of course I don't want to go through the terrifying process of trying to kill off my body. All sorts could fail and I could end up much worse off. Honestly, I deeply resent it that I'm faced with this problem if I really want out.

But still- it's like- do you want a life filled with rainbows or, do you really want to kill yourself? It simply isn't realistic. That's not the choice we get. It's either to live and struggle through hell to (possibly) get things to be better or, take a risk on suicide which as an act isn't appealing to most of us either. Neither are exactly ideal choices.

But financial aid still hasn't been dispersed and trying to find housing is so stressful. I can't sleep, my hair is falling out, and I'm wondering if this is even worth it.

I read in a self help book recently that stressful things feel less overwhelming when your brain knows you have an escape or out, so that's why when we are extremely stressed we think of killing ourselves. It's like our brain's attempt to take control of a situation we feel we have no control of. It also gives us an escape, and just the idea of an escape can supposedly give your brain the small comfort it needs to keep going.

Do what you wish with that. Maybe if you can talk with a family or friend about if everything does not work that they could support you though it you would have that escape plan that's not ctb. Or maybe you could start with little things you can control and work on those to make your brain feel more ready for the harder decisions.

I can't keep living anymore, I'm exhausted,2568511,floating_cloud,"Jun 20, 2024 at 7:38 PM","My entire life, I've never known what it's like to be part of a normal, functioning family. Our household was a constant battleground filled with fights and yelling. My siblings, my mother, and I were treated like servants by my father. On top of that, our family was extremely religious, with rigid values that dominated our lives.

I've always believed I was the cause of all the conflict. If I hadn't been born, my mom might have left my narcissistic father. If I had been more religious and never left it, my parents might not have abused me. If I had been a better sibling, my brothers and sisters wouldn't have had to suffer the consequences of my parents' failures.

I moved out for university, hoping to escape all of that. Yet, even though I'm physically away, I still feel overwhelmed and unable to continue. I've tried picking up hobbies and finding ways to improve my life, but nothing seems to help. I'm still so tired, and I can't envision a future for myself. I just want it all to end.

Every day, I feel like I'm drowning in a sea of expectations and guilt. It's like there's a weight on my chest that I can't shake off. I hear my father's voice in my head, telling me I'm worthless and will never amount to anything. The constant criticism and belittling have made me doubt every move I make.

I've never felt truly loved or accepted. My parents made me feel like I was a burden, like my existence was a mistake. They never supported my dreams or interests; instead, they crushed them, telling me I was foolish for even trying. Every hobby I wanted to pursue was shot down. I loved art, but they told me I needed to focus on school. I wanted to swim, but they said a girl shouldn't show her body. I was interested in judo, but they insisted it was too boyish. The emotional scars run deep, and no matter how hard I try to heal, the pain is always there.

All my childhood, all I did was try to survive and make my parents proud. I don't even know what my own personality is or what I want in life because I've never lived for myself. I've only ever lived for my parents and my family.

I struggle to connect with others because I fear they'll see the broken person I am inside. I'm always anxious, always second-guessing myself. I can't shake the feeling that I'm fundamentally flawed, that no matter what I do, I'll never be good enough.

Even though I've escaped the physical environment, the mental torment follows me everywhere. The nightmares, the flashbacks, the constant feeling of inadequacy – they never leave me. I feel like I'm stuck in a cycle of despair, and I don't know how to break free.

I just want the pain to stop. I want to find peace, but it seems so far out of reach. Every day is a struggle to keep going, to find a reason to stay alive. I feel so alone, so misunderstood. I just want it all to end.",,,,,,,,,,,,

And to join said forum you must also own their Peaceful Pill handbook, that's another $95 Australian. Exit says that their members will get a $10 discount for their books, but that's still $185 in total.
They offer other stuff as well, admittedly, which most of the time they still have to pay more money for, and most seemed like a waste of money to me, whether they had to pay for it or not. You pay about $68 USD a year to pay almost $58 for an ebook and go to a glorified convention where they can discuss topics related to suicide that you've already seen on the news (or watch videos of said convention), have a Zoom chat every three months, get access to a handful of videos that are years-old that I highly doubt contains any information that isn't already publicly available, get told the LATEST NEWS on assisted suicide that's already on the news that you don't have to pay $68 for, get a copy of a newsletter that anyone, member or not, can download for free anyway from Exit's website, aaaaand get a recording of them talking at a different convention to the one mentioned earlier, which you still have to pay $75 USD for if you didn't attend said convention, regardless of membership. There's also them offering to help people travel to Switzerland for assisted suicide, which I originally thought might actually be about the only thing worth paying for... turns out you still have to pay at least a €1,750 for the basic package of them saying they'll ""help with your applications""...somehow, so it's not like you're giving them almost two grand to pay for your flight or hotel or whatever, and you can only get it if you're a member anyway (they do not allow non-members to buy it at all), and they themselves admit they can't guarantee the Swiss doctors will even accept you, with no mentions of refunds if that happens. Exit membership mostly just seems like a way to gatekeep most of their stuff so that only the old can access it, while charging stupid amounts for it. Yes, I would consider two grand a large amount of money to get Exit to ""help"" with an application to get assisted suicide in Switzerland with no refunds offered if they say no. Yes, I consider $68 a year a large amount of money to access a web forum, a shitty convention that happens once a year, a Zoom chat that happens every few months, a bunch of materials which if you ask me should be free domain anyway, and to either get a slight discount on some books, or just be able to pay even more money for them to maybe (benefit of the doubt here, ""helping with your application"" is very vague if you ask me) do your paperwork for you at best, if that's what their ""help"" even is, and the books and their Swiss paperwork service are both gatekept so that only old people can access them.
The more I look into Exit, the more I see them as just publicity-seeking grifters who both want to take the money off old people who just want to avoid terminal illnesses, and gatekeep being ""pro-choice"" by advertising themselves as being the big, noble pro-choice organisation that also only thinks that choice should be applied to old people, while throwing SaSu under the bus.",2592377,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unfortunately, that will never happen. As soon as you begin actually talking about why people are suicidal, then everyone gets all huffy and defensive. Then they start pacing, crossing their arms, furrowing their brows, putting their hands on their hips, wiping their foreheads, scratching their heads, and ripping their hair out, because suddenly, our lives are intersecting with their pride, fantasies, and investments. Maybe if you're lucky, they'll regurgitate some feelgood fauxlosophical buffoonery onto you to warm your tummy with.

But yeah, it's much easier to just staple these band-aids to this gangrenous limb and forget about it until it starts to stink again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact is that life can get very torturous for any human or other sentient animal any day . To deny people a way to escape extreme torture is pure evil.

They are passing it because the NY times wrote that article trying to get this site and SN banned : here's the proof the congress monsters refrence the NY times article as their source of info:
""A 2021 New York Times investigation into an online suicide forum found that sodium nitrite was being popularized and encouraged as an easily accessible method to die by suicide. The forum, which is disguised as a safe place to discuss suicidal ideation, hosts threads where anonymous users provide detailed instructions and real-time guidance on how to die by suicide using sodium nitrite. A 2021 toxicology publication based on data from the National Poison Data System (NPDS), one of the data sources used by the CDC, points to a rise in self-poisonings using sodium nitrite in the United States since 2017.""

House Passes Trahan’s Youth Poisoning Protection Act
trahan.house.gov

Junko Furuta was age 16 when a gang kidnapped her and tortured her for 44 days. So these politicians in the U.S. would not allow her to have SN, even after being tortured for a few days because they say she doesn't have the mental capacity to tell that her suffering was bad enough to exit this hell. they'll say Junko needs to be 18 no now 25 to have mental capacity. She did beg her captors to kill her but they wouldn't . how are these politicians any different from those kidnappers?

44 days Hell: The gruesome story of the torture and murder of Junko Furuta!
Junko Furuta was a 16-year-old Japanese girl who was subjected to 44 days of rape and torture before dying at the hands of her captors on November 22, 1989
www.anabelmagazine.com

So it's ridiculous to say that she couldn't have the mental capacity to know the SN would kill her but that it would allow her to escape her extreme torture. Plus she like everyone should know that she would've died anyway as we all will . the question is not will we die but how much will we suffer between now and certain death. Clearly SN or N or cyanide or a gunshot would be less suffering than her or most diseases like cancer or dementia.

The fact is that life can get very torturous for any human or other sentient animal any day . To deny people a way to escape extreme torture is pure evil.",2591121,,,,,,,,,,,,

==================================================================

That's what they are naming it as a deception . there is no age stated . they are just making SN a banned hazardous substance. One of my points is the lies . if it were to protect the children they would say you need proof of age over 18 to purchase. They use that ""protecting youth"" as a gateway",2591854,,,,,,,,,,,,

Like if this was actually aimed at protecting the youth, then it would only make sense for people 18+, or atleast 21+, to still be allowed to buy it. To me, this is lawmakers being shamelessly bold that they don't give a shit about people's life circumstances or the actual reasons they want to die. They care about public image, and if that means outright deceiving most of the public by naming a bill ""youth protection"" when it has nothing to do with age, they'll do that no problem.

They won't enact laws that actually reduce suffering and make people's lives more bearable, because that won't get them the clap on the back that saying ""we're protecting the children!"" does. They choose that praise and false public image over doing things that could actually reduce people's desire to die.

I do have Oxycodone which could possibly be used in place of Morphine, but I'm still unsure on that.

Give yourself a lot of credit for wanting to get better and don't let this flame be put out completely, even when you are almost conviced that nothing will help you.
I don't know if that is your first go at antidepressants, but try to give yourself some more time and try different meds as the journey through SSRIs and others is full of surprises. Sometimes the first few are not effective, but other might be, be strong and try not to give up on them.
Maybe even ask your psychiatrist to add some anti-anxiety or mood stabilisers to the mix.

I think along with the sadness and despair that you feel, that grief can easily turn into anger and rage. when we feel that there's no other alternative? a destructive path makes even more sense.

at the same time, your suffering and what you've been through involves you and is yours alone. it isn't fair to drag down another person with you, no matter what they did or how much they hurt you.

homicidal thoughts are one thing, but if you intend on acting out on these urges, that's a different story.

we have threads on the forum of people venting about these desires, in order to make sense of and seek help for them, and that's okay. but again, murder under no circumstance is okay, and discussions pertaining to your intent on committing murder will not be tolerated.

often times, venting about homicidal thoughts has helped members get the support that they need to address those desires. I'm hoping that stays true in your case as well.

like @Jabr0ni mentioned, how honest were you with your therapist about these homicidal thoughts?

Anti-anxiety and mood stabilizers could help, and they're worth a try, especially if you feel like you have nothing to lose. But again, it requires you being honest with a professional about these feelings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why is your method SN?,2592338,DesperateOne,"Jul 11, 2024 at 12:35 AM","From what I've read it takes 10-20 min to knock you unconscious which is terrifying to me since that is enough time for reality to set in and abort.

Why is your method SN?,2592373,Forever Sleep,"Jul 11, 2024 at 1:22 AM","It just seems like the lesser of the evils. The process I'm hoping will kick up less SI than say hanging, jumping, train. It also depends if you're concerned about breaking the law. I don't fancy a criminal record trying to obtain Class A drugs. It can be done at home, in private. With any luck, it will involve discomfort rather than excruciating pain and fear.

Really though- all homegrown methods can fail. They all have their problems. I agree that SN likely isn't the magic powder it sometimes seems to be worshipped as. What method is though? My friend said she watched a video of an assisted suicide once which didn't even look entirely peaceful! The man struggled to drink the solution (Nembutal pressumably) and said it tasted foul and burned his throat.

Even executions have gone wrong and they're supposed to be professionals. The depressing thing (for suicidal people anyway) is that I don't think the human body is always that easy to kill. Some of it seems to be down to luck.

I do understand why people question just why SN seems to be so favoured but I'm always curious to know- what do you think sounds better? What method do you know that never fails and never has complications if it does fail? Ultimately, we're trying to shut down our bodies bit by bit. I imagine, any process that fails in doing that or, is interupted will leave us maimed rather than dead. For me, SN is simply the best out of a bad bunch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why is your method SN?,2592391,justwannadip,"Jul 11, 2024 at 1:56 AM","Was the easiest and cheapest thing to get. Its definitely not ideal, I struggle with the exact same issue and fear as you; I'm terrified my SI and anxiety will make me abort and call for help. That would be awful and a worst case scenario. I get hyperaware and anxious (OCD) about a lot of things so I can imagine me panicking after taking it and freaking out when the symptoms start to show. I'm trying to imagine the process in my head and practice being numb to it but ik nothing is like when you've actually taken it and you know its only a matter of time before it kills you. I also have an aversion to the process of thing dying or being abandoned (even with throwing things out), and I get this weird sentimental urge to preserve and not 'throw out' or kill something. As a kid I couldn't kill any bugs even if they were spiders (i was terrified). So killing myself wont be easy. I'm afraid I'm gonna end up doing that with myself, even tho my brain fucking hates me and its whole purpose has been to destroy me, in this way it somehow keeps me alive.

Ideal would be N, and then inert gas if I trusted myself enough to set it up properly. Fent would also be a possibility but I don't have the funds or the know how to get it. SN is already on the way for me, so I'll likely have to settle with it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

My ctb ideations kind of came on when I became very ill from a set of life altering conditions (CFS, POTS, mast cell activation, brain fog, nerve pain etc). I was never a fully happy person before this but I was … regular? But I never wanted to ctb until my health deteriorated.

The thing is, I don't ""WANT"" to die. But I don't want to live like this, and these conditions are all lifelong. It's painful to mourn for what my life used to be and all the things im missing out on now and the plans for my life that I won't be able to achieve. I cry everyday about this, on top of the horrible symptoms each day.

I've given up on living life, because I'm not expecting myself to be alive in a month or two. I'm not going out unless forced, not socializing, not eating. I'm basically just on my phone in bed all day just watching videos to escape from my reality.

It's just terrible though because I'd do anything to be healthy and get my life back on track. I'm not someone who believes that life is hell and that death is better.

I did try a plastic bag on my h ad with handcuffs behind my back which ended up horrifying me.

A gun seems like it would be the quickest and unlike hanging won't drag out a painful experience.

I'm just not sure how to make something as quick. Maybe a bomb if I could find directions.

I'm probably grasping as straws but it's disappointment in my life that is forcing me to feel this desperate. I have health issues that are getting worse and in a living situation that is pretty dire.

Buying a gun in the midwest (USA) / Looking for my state's gun laws,2592305,3/4Dead,"Jul 10, 2024 at 11:45 PM","Looked around and couldn't really get any clear answers so I'm turning to you all. Couldn't decide if i should tag method or help
Note, I'm super pro gun-control and try not to think about the USA's janky gun laws as much as I can so I'm entirely in foreign teritory here.

I live in the midwest US, to avoid location specifics for the sake of privacy I hope 'midwest' is specific enough. I am going back to researching my original method, as in my state you need to be 21 to obtain a FOID (unless a parent signs off) which is necessary for any purchase of a handgun with a public vendor, however I believe the minimum age for a long gun (and/or shotgun as I'm planning) is 18, which, of course I am since I'm on here.

I am over 18, but not 21, not able to get gaurdian sign-off on FOID nor gun purchase, and I'll look around for gun shows in my area, but I'm struggling to where I can look up recent gun laws in my state, as I'm kind of struggling to find clear reliable sources.

I don't have any kind of record, so that isn't an issue, but, in fear of sounding stupid, could I just walk into a store, flash my drivers lisence to prove im of age, and buy a shotgun and ammo for it no questions asked or...? What else would buying one from a store entail? I don't really want to buy one online, my original original plan, as ordering it to the living space I share with my parents is a dangerous gamble I'm not really interested in.

1:) Having to email them in order to buy it. I don't know If there's a specific way i should write my email and if there's any potential to screw it up. They seem like a professional business so I'm worried it's possible to set off red flags with them.
2:) If the packaging will be discreet. They seem to be a professional chemical supplier so I imagine they'll cover the parcel in all sorts of warnings and labels which will certainly tip off customs if that's the case. Can I ask them for discreet packaging? Or is that too suspicious?

If you're someone who believes in evolution and that the ""purpose"" of that is to continue the species - I don't understand how evolution, a non conscious thing, can have a purpose?

- Nothing is objectively meaningful. Life is not a biproduct of meaning. I don't believe God exists and I don't believe life has any purpose or meaning to it.

However -

- We have evolved to experience things as meaningful, so on some level things can be meaningful in the sense that things are meaningful TO YOU. Nothing out there has objective meaning inside of it, but the meaning exists in the experience. It's meaningful to you but not necessarily to someone else.

- It's whether or not that thing has emotional significance to you that determines if it is going to be meaningful or not.

So it does exist on a subjective level. Just like Beauty doesn't objectively exist but it does subjectively in your experience. You're not going to say beauty doesn't exist are you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Questions for people who don't believe in God/ think life is meaningless,2556781,drearysunrise,"Jun 11, 2024 at 9:58 AM","My view is very similar to Dark Window's. When it comes to evolutionary purpose, I would say that the subjective experience of meaning helps keep us alive by promoting positive social behavior. Experiencing a sense of purpose gives people the motivation to contribute to society in ways that facilitate survival of the collective. I also think it makes people less likely to resort to suicide. With how harsh reality is, and all of the inconveniences and pain we happen to experience in life, I'm not sure that the human race would want to live at all without this idea of making sense of it all. Hence why people who feel purposeless often do feel depressed or suicidal.

Evolution doesn't really have a ""purpose"". We just use that to refer to the premise of how it works. A living being with traits that help them survive is just more likely to survive and reproduce. It isn't perfect and calculated. You can examine both the body and mind and find many ways in which the traits humans have are simply ""good enough"" to survive without being as efficient as they theoretically could be.

I think we tend to ascribe purpose and intent to that force of nature largely because it exists in contrast to the established religious concept of intelligent design. I also think it's because our brains evolved to problem-solve, so we often examine the evolution of traits from a human perspective of reverse engineering, where humans design everything with a purpose in mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Questions for people who don't believe in God/ think life is meaningless,2556831,Artemisia,"Jun 11, 2024 at 10:39 AM","The concepts of meaning and purpose are just a consequence of self awareness. When human brains evolved enough that our ancestors became self aware and capable of abstract thinking, they almost certainly struggled with the question of ""why?"". Why am I here, is that all there is, hunt, eat, suffer, etc? As far as we know, animals have no concept of meaning and purpose, they act on instinct, they exist in the here and now, and maybe only incipiently some have that combination of self awareness and abstract thinking, but no where near human levels. As far as we know, no animals have a concept of gods or religion.
So humans struggled with the realization that death is the end, that suffering has no meaning and it's easier just to end it all, with the perception of how big and uncontrollable the world/universe is, etc, etc. And evolution being what it is gave those who were capable of imagining a solution to that problem an edge, an advantage. Those who could imagine answers to not only that issue, but also to everyday happenings, like why does it rain sometimes, why is it so dry sometimes that we barely have enough to eat, how can we control if it rains or not, etc, etc, could calm themselves, give themselves an explanation that eased their fears of nothingness and impotence in the great scheme of things. In an imponderable world this was an advantage and those who could do it were almost certainly more motivated to go on with daily life than those who could not. Being religious became the norm because it made our brains not freak out when asking the difficult questions about life and the universe. With the advancement of science that became less necessary and that's why the higher and better scientific education the less prone people are to be religious. Of course we still struggle with purpose, because we're aware all these things, but purpose doesn't have to be grandiose, doesn't have to be about changing the world either now or for the future. Individual purpose can be just living to make sure your children are happy and well set for life, being successful in a big pay, big house, big car sort of way. Or eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow you die. When all purpose is lost, people do inevitably get depressed and depression is characterized by not taking care of oneself, being less capable of reacting to danger, less capable of having children or taking care of them so that they reach adulthood and perpetuate the species. Evolution obviously does not favor depressed people and that's why, even with the huge development of science, our brains still benefit from finding purpose.

It's obvious you had a very poor scientific education, I see it time and time again in people who struggle to understand evolution. You're almost certainly American.
Evolution may not have that higher meaning, but it certainly has purpose. Evolution is not some path towards perfection or anything like that. Survival of the fittest is also misinterpreted, as it often has little to do with being bigger or stronger. The purpose of evolution is adaption to the ever changing environment. Climate changes, conditions change, what was yesterday the fittest is today unfit. Evolution can happen slowly overtime, like when one region starts getting progressively hotter or colder and the living things that inhabit it have to adapt. Take a cold area that becomes hotter: cold adapted animals usually have big layers of isolating fat, lots of fur, small noses/snout. An animal that doesn't have lots of fat and fur isn't likely to survive very long and reproduce. But then the weather starts getting slowly warmer, the big, fat and and furry, well adjusted animal from before starts overheating, can't run as fast, either can't hunt enough food or can't escape the predators. As for the skinner guy, it now feels fine, is able to get food and get away from predators and pass on its genes to many offspring.
Evolution can also happen quite fast, but the principle is the same. The classical example is about moths and the industrial revolution in the UK. Moths used to be whitish so as to blend well with the bark of birch trees, which made it harder for predators to spot them. Then a factory was built which produced lots of dark smoke, this smoke covered the bark of the trees and turned them dark. Suddenly, the whitish moths that had so well prospered, stood out like they had a target on their backs. But nature is always prepared for this sort of catastrophic event. You see, even if it wasn't benefitial at all for them, dark moths were always born along the white ones. Only a few and with little change to live long, but they did exist. And suddenly, they were the fittest for that environment, the ones living long and reproducing. In very few years the moths were almost all dark... and then factories became cleaner, birch trees went back showing their real colours, and moths are now mostly whitish again.
This is evolution and its purpose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Just like other feelings- happiness, satisfaction, anger, jealousy. It's a response we do or don't get to outside stimulus. As to what stimulates us to feel motivated- like something is worth pursuing in life is just as individual as what makes us laugh, what makes us cry etc.

I suppose then the question is- why do we have emotions at all? What is their purpose? I guess it's to try and tell us what things we want more of in life and- what we want to avoid.

As for evolutionary benefit- I imagine most of the most successful of our species- in terms of achievement anyhow- inventing, discovering or creating things were likely very motivated. They found purpose through their achievements in their field and we got to reap the benefits most likely.

Imagine if your favourite musicians or authors/ artists/ actors/ inventors/ philosophers/ scientists/ athletes etc. had taken the nihilist approach and not bothered! I reckon life would be all that bit harder and more depressing if no one bothered pursuing their dreams.

Plus, it's a competitive world out there. You may not even succeed if you do actually work hard to achieve your goals but if there's no motivation at all, it's got to be even harder.

If you can't distinguish things that exists only in the realm of concepts in the human mind from things that are inherent to nature and the universe at large, then it makes this discussion somewhat redundant.

Your brain interprets the world, and attributes meaning to it. The reason it's that way is because it was useful to our survival and procreation. It's quite simple actually, I don't understand why you resist accepting it.
Also, accepting the nature of your brain not necessarily make things less meaningful, at the end of the day,the only way to live life with purpose is to accept your intuition and follow your ""heart"". If you love your family, want to make a contribution to society, wanna help people around you, wanna be a good friend, prosper financially, you should simply follow your desires.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,2592232,HandfulofBasil,"Jul 10, 2024 at 8:57 PM","I've been having a really tough time with my family. Like really rough. A few days ago my mom kind of force me to have a conversation with everyone that I Did Not Want To Have about me being trans and how I feel like I'm not accepted by them and one of the things my grandmother said was that I'm FORCING them to try and adopt my """"""new"""""" identity and I could not fucking believe what I was hearing. I purposely took being misgendered every fucking day for 2 fucking years because I didn't want to have to deal with push back and further confirmation that my family doesn't give a shit about me, who I am, or making me feel comfortable in a place I'm supposed to call home. To add insult to injury they had the fucking gull to tell me I can talk to them about this without my mom needing to be there as a buffer when they have done Nothing to prove that and EVERYTHING to make it seem otherwise. Nothing that has been said or done to me in the history of my openly being trans has EVER resulted in me thinking that I can be open to them about my feelings on the matter without feeling like even more shit when it's over. I didn't even get to end the conversation on my own terms, my mom interjected and ended things when I mentioned cis people because the term was something new to her and it was ""too much for her to take in"" But in the end my grandparents agreed to try to use my pronouns and correct themselves if they slip up. Barely. In actuality it's not even that. My grandfather himself only promised to just use my name in place of any pronouns as if I have none. That's not right at all and they fucking know it but they don't care. Not that it fucking matters because the properly gendering me thing only lasted for a few hours. A few fucking hours, not even the rest of the day. By that night they were back to she/her-ing me with no attempt at correction.

And then the past few days they've been having issues with my siblings but I get fucking dragged into it because they keep telling my mom ""your children are lazy bastards"", lumping us all together while I'm right fucking there. They don't fucking understand how hard I'm struggling, they never will. I have to focus most my attention and energy into going to work and going to school because if I don't I will go back to a state where I'm barely functioning, but when I do what I can to clean around the house but it's never enough. They always have something to complain about when I try and it fucking tears me me down inside. And when I got home from work there was a note on the fridge with a slew of ludicrous rules with the add on ""if you can't follow these rules, please leave"". I'm so fucking worn down mentally I'm just running on fumes at this point. I've had to stop watching one of my favorite channels on YouTube because he covers bizarre medical cases and all I can zero in on is ways to cause serious harm to myself. Everyday they do or say something to me that makes me think ""I'm going to fucking kill myself"" and every time it become less and less of a joke. I know for certain that if I stay here I'm going to start seriously considering making another attempt. And with a mix of knowing I can't rebound from it failing like I did in high school and having access to things I didn't before, that really isn't something I should be dwelling I need to get the fuck out of here but I have no where to go and it feels like I'm fucking suffocating. It's starting to get to the point where as a warm body or a cold one doesn't matter to me, I just need to permanently get out of this situation.

,2592210,Deficiency,"Jul 10, 2024 at 8:17 PM","I think I am just better off dead


The only reason I stay is for others but, they will be far better without me


I am useless. I bring nothing to any kind of table. There are no talents in me. My fingers can barely play a melody. My voice can barely tell an interesting story. My arms can barely move things. There is nothing extraordinary about me. Even the things I'm good at, I'm average at. Just average. If I left, why would anyone miss me? Really? I would leave no empty space in anyone's life


I am not memorable. Not in a good way. Just seen as a nutjob or a bitch. I suppose that's all there really is to me.


Maybe I am a looney. I shouldn't have this fractured of a mind. I shouldn't have anything and everything be a trigger. It's constant. ""man this kitchen is clean. Hey remember how filthy and probably toxic the kitchen you grew up with was? Ohhh yeah and how you'd sometimes go days without any heating or electricity?"" Even just seeing a loving mother or father with their child immediately makes me question ""why couldn't I have that?"". And even now, when life is good, I finally met the love of my life after 10 years of waiting - and I still just want to end things.


I don't think I can be fixed. I think my mind is too disordered by all these years. I will never be able to function. I will never be able to be a good person. I will forever just crawl along. And forever let people down. I can't even look after myself for god sake.


Everyone's life would be no different really. And I barely message people anymore. Maybe all these months of isolating myself was in preparation for my death. Maybe I couldn't admit to myself it was going to happen. But. Subconsciously I knew. I've been preparing everyone for a while. My absence really won't be that much different.


There's nothing to miss about me. I'm a mood leech, I'm always negative. No one wants to be around someone as tragic as me. I'm a downer. I just bring people down. I'm not good at anything, I have no skills. I'm not the next Picasso or Einstein. No talent would be wasted. My face will never be missed. I am an eye sore. It hurts to look in the mirror. It saddens me that this is the face that people see. No one will want to look at a photograph of me. No one will want to remember me


It's not like I've don't anything with my life anyway. All I've done year upon year, is exist despite everything. But what cause for celebration is it really? Other people have it worse than me. And look at me. I have a flat, I have food, I have an income, I have the love of my life. Life is wonderful. But my brain is just too tapped. I damaged myself too much over the years out of hatred after years of hatred from my father. And now, I will never be happy. I don't deserve to be. I don't deserve anything apart from pain. But even when you accept your fate, you get tired I suppose. I reached 24 years. And I don't see any future for myself. I can't see myself ever climbing out of this hole. I will end up getting unwell and ruining everything. Because I will never deserve anything. I don't deserve the love that I have with my partner. And neither does he. He should not love me. I am not good for him. I just drag him down. Annoy him. I'm mean. I'm everything that he doesn't deserve. He deserves so much more than me. He deserves the world. He doesn't deserve this freak of a person.


I love him dearly. I always have. My heart has broken many times for him before when I thought I'd lost him forever. But now that I have him, here I am wanting to throw it all away. He was always the goal. But even now, I just want to go. He sees a future with me. I could see one with him, but what I see stronger for my future is nothing. I can't see myself there. I see no future with me alive. I am not meant to be here anymore. It is not fair for him to deal with my nonsense any longer. I know I am broken. I can't let him sit and pick up the pieces for me anymore. He doesn't deserve this. He deserves the brightest stars in the universe. He deserves the moon just like he deserves the world. He shouldn't be with a fixer-upper like me. I am too much work. I am not worth any of this effort. I am a shell of a human. And he is the brightest soul that ever lived.


I think it would be easier for him if I left now. I know I will be the cause of my end. I think I've always known that suicide was my cause of death. It has loomed over me for a very long time. Better now than down the line. I should not prolong a false happiness for him. He deserves to be happy, but all the love and happiness I give to him is tainted. It is harsh, but he will recover better if I don't prolong my life. Because in every universe, I always kill myself. It will be easier when there is less memories. Less words said. Less love shared. I am regretful of that. I have never loved someone like him. But I can't see him try and fix me anymore. He deserves so much more than that. So much more than me.


I was never supposed to make it this far anyway. I am an anomaly that needs to be erased.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I came home early and I felt a choking anxiety as I thought about how close in time my ctb attempt is. The thought of what comes after, if there is anything still somewhat terrifies,

I was christian years ago, and the thought of hell always weighed on me. Not only for me, but wondering about people I knew who died. When I moved out of Christianity and became agnostic atheist, I went on a journey through philosophy. I personally found that one of the oddly unifying things about the great thinkers of our race, was their willingness to trust in what they understood.

I don't know what's coming. I don't know a lot of things. What I do know is I've grown fond of the mystical style of thought that Alan Watts popularized, atheism in the name of god. The idea that I don't have to make claims about god, god's nature, heaven or hell; that I can look at all the aspects of it presented by our history, and accept how marvelous and terrifying our reality could be. I don't have to force anything, I can just be, and choose to see a reality that brings me comfort.

In a simple way this is what a remind myself when I'm afraid. Of course it doesn't stop the fear one bit, but something about the freedom of knowing nothing is 100% certain, gives me something else to focus on. It's all possible but it doesn't matter, doesn't change the life I've lived, and if I'm wrong there will hardly be any time for regrets.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I believe there will be a physical resurrection at the end of the world though, but until then a dead human is just an unconscious corpse returning to dust. Believers will rise again with an immortal painless, sorrowless, sinless body and unbelievers will rise but be judged for their sins and then cast into ""hell"" where they are annihilated by BURNING UP (NOT live forever there). So as a believer who is forgiven by faith, after dying (even by suicide) I don't fear becoming a floating ghost soul either in ""heaven"" or ""hell"". I will simply go unconscious for however many centuries there will be until the end, and then directly wake up in a new body on a new earth after Jesus returned.

I just study the Bible myself and have listened to many debates and sides and picked what I found most alined with the text of Scripture itself. The stuff about no ""souls"" is rare, yes. But there are a few Christians throughout history who believe it. It's called physicalism. I also first heard it a year ago, from a guy named Chris Date (you can search him on youtube). He is a reformed calvinist also, but I don't agree with that part. Also, it's theological scholars, including scholars of Judaism and the Old Testament, who have said more and more recently that the idea of immaterial eternal souls may be non-existant in the actual text of Scripture and is a mistranslation or interpretation (although very prevalent). Also, if you go back to the early Christian creeds and confessions, they mention nothing about souls going to heaven or ""hell"" (except Jesus Himself after being crucified), but they clearly mention humans being resurrected bodily. Very interesting stuff.

[SUCCESS] Acquired the holy grail antiemetic (metoclopramide) in Canada legitimately,2562045,Alexei_Kirillov,"Jun 15, 2024 at 3:14 PM","@Into-the-abyss @anxiousguineapig @JotCBT

I've seen a couple threads lately from Canadians wondering how to acquire AEs since we can't use online pharmacies here. I am pleased to announce that I have successfully acquired metoclopramide through completely legitimate means (without even having to tell a single lie in my case, too!), and so I wanted to make a post detailing my experience, hopefully you guys can benefit.

This may be province-dependent but in Quebec, pharmacists are allowed to start you on a course of medication for certain ""minor"" issues, including the ""prevention and treatment of vomiting."" So I walked into my pharmacy and asked the pharmacist if he could prescribe me an ""antiemetic to prevent vomiting, for example, metoclopramide or domperidone"" (I specifically named these two medications). When he asked why, I explained that I have a condition called cyclic vomiting syndrome, where I have severe vomiting episodes every four months, and that since my last episode was in February, I'm expecting my next one soon. (This is true).

A series of questions followed, among others:
Have I already been prescribed meto for my CVS? Response: No.
Do I take anything else for it? Response: I sometimes take ibuprofen to try to manage it but that given the severity of the episodes, it's not sufficient.
Am I able to keep anything down during the episodes (he now suggested Gravol instead because if I'm unable to keep anything down, then pills aren't the best option)? Response: I can always tell from my migraine when an episode is coming on, so this is a non-issue because I'd be able to take the pills before the vomiting starts.
Why meto in particular, have I already had an experience with it? Response: from my research (which I emphasized was just basic internet research and I'm not an expert on the topic), there are multiple classes of antiemetics. I'm specifically looking for the one that works via dopamine, so either meto or domperidone or anything else in that class would work.
He accepted all these responses and then prescribed me 20*5mg meto. It cost $9 in total. Walked out of there with a smile on my face lmao.

TLDR: You may have more luck acquiring an antiemetic through your pharmacist--who will probably be less discerning--than your family doctor. This strategy also has the advantage that you can try multiple different pharmacists from multiple different pharmacies without needing any appointments or arousing any suspicion.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I told him that the last few days I felt the exact same way as I did then and was wondering if it was possible to get some.

He basically said meto is a very steong medication administered in hospitals for vomiting. He instead prescribed me imitrex df 100mg to deal with the migraine first, since he believes the vomiting and nauseau are symptoms of the migraine.

The minimum lot is 0.5kg). They are supposed to ship to Europe, but unfortunately I currently live on an island and they only ship by land (I had to find a service that handled shipping from Poland with a temporary address: e.g. Shopogolic); they accept payment in Polish Zloty, so I had to use an intermediary who converted the currency and sent the transfer (e.g. Wise).

A second seller (I don't think I've read about this elsewhere in the forum) I found in Portugal, a shop in Lisbon that deals with restoration and conservation materials: they ship all over Europe, minimum batch 1 kg. Again I am still waiting for receipt.

It's this form of self hatred I have for myself in utter disappointment knowing that I have teamed up with such ridiculous people.

There are 7 of you. 6 of you makes me want to cry EVERYDAY which I have this class EVERYTIME there is a group discussion involved. The only time I actually didn't cry was when the teacher did individual assignment review where no one asked me any stupid question that made my sanity snap.

To that 1 person who didn't make me wanna cry I want to confess my love and appreciation of you being a member. No not love you romantically. Just my heart being warmed up at the thought of you because how bad the other 6 are.

To the rest of you setbacks, why? Why do you make my life so hard? So many group works and ideas. No one has the initiative to carry it out. I ASSIGNED roles for it.

Dear editor. The edit which took you ONE DAY can cost me 5 mins. You have no idea how many curse words I threw at you in my mind when I received the video. The voice doesn't match the video. There's no subtitles. The part where theres no words spoken aren't cut out. The stutters are not corrected or even attempted to be corrected. During class you make me want to cry in class you would sit in the cornor of the class and look at your phone the whole time. You won't participate in group discussion. Over the course of the last few weeks I only seen you even sit in a circle with the group TWICE. Today I went home, crying because of this sense of hopelessness I felt the moment I received your video. IT TOOK ME LESS THAN A DAY TO EDIT A 30 MINUTE VIDEO. YOU TOOK A DAY TO EDIT 2x 25second videos which are barely edited you might as well give me the raws and call it a day. I puked twice reaching home and cried. I would think that with the amount of time you spent on the phone you would know the quality of very short 30s videos should be. But no. You made 2 failures out of a somewhat decent raw with your editing. Not visual edits, no sound edits, barely passable synchronisation of video and sound and no subs. I worked with worst raws or 30 minutes of a person stuttering and I had to manually create subs because their accent was too heavy. WHAT IN THE VIDEO DEGREE ARE YOU TAKING IF YOUR EDITS ARE LIKE THIS? AT LEAST HAVE A DECENT SYNCHRONISATION. At home reflecting and thinking about you got me crazy, because I was thinking I was actually for once grateful for you for joining the group discussion by standing there and looking at your phone. At least the teacher will think we're working in a group. DO YOU KNOW HOW BAD OF A TEAMMATE YOU ARE TO HAVE PEOPLE APPRECIATE YOU FOR BEING THERE? I never thought I would grade a teammate a 0/5. You made me want to do that. Throughout the semester. I told the group repeatedly. Suggest ideas etc. At least everyone took part in suggesting ideas. THE ONLY WORK YOU'VE EVER BEEN ASSIGNED WITH AND YOU MESSED IT UP. IT IS EMBARRASSING TO POST YOUR VIDEO.

To the two. I get that you struggle with the language barrier. Thank you for suggesting ideas and also carrying out the assigned job decently. TAKE INITIATIVE AND TRACK THE GROUP ASSIGNMENT TASK. I ASSIGNED THAT TASK LAST TUESDAY SAYING I EXPECT THE VIDEO ON WEDNESDAY. SO YOU DECIDE TO SHOOT ON TUESDAY AS THOUGH THE EDITOR DOESN'T NEED TIME?

For that other guy in the other corner unlike the rest of the 6. YOU UNDERSTAND ENGLISH. WHY ARE YOU ASKING WHAT TO DO DIRECTLY AFTER TEACHER SAID WHAT TO DO. WHAT EVEN PISSES ME MORE OFF IS WHEN YOU ASK WHERE DO WE GO TO FIND THE QUESTION AS THOUGH THE TEACHER DIDN'T ALWAYS SAYS X WEEK CHAPTER X SLIDES. YOU LOOK AT YOUR PHONE WHEN TEACHER'S TALKING AND ASK ME WHEN TEACHER IS DONE TALKING. WHY BOTHER COMING TO SCHOOL AT ALL?

For the other two, HOW MANY TIMES DID TEACHER SAY MAKE YOUR OWN CONTENT? CAN YOU LOOK AT THE CONTENT WE POSTED? CAN YOU MAKE MORE ORIGINAL ONE? IDEAS IDEAS IDEAS YET NONE OF YOU WANT TO CARRY IT OUT WHEN YOU GUYS HAVE THE PRODUCT. YOU GUYS BE GIVING AND ASKING ME ON MORE DETAIL ON AN IDEA WHEN BOTH OF YOU WHL ARE THE MAIN PARTIES INTERESTED I THE SUGGESTION SPEAKS THE SAME LANGUAGE. WHY DOES IT HAVE TO GK THROUGH ME?

To one of the other two, shy in communication ? Congrats. Guess what you're not the only introvert around here. Tons of us are. It's whether or not you're willing to step out of your comfort zones. WHY ARE YOU MAKING THE PARTY WE'RE COLLABORATING WITH (A) CONTACT SOMEONE WHO ISN'T EVEN PART OF OUR GROUP (B) AND ASKING B TO CONTACT A ON A MESSAGE YOU WANNA GIVE THEM WHEN A HAD REPEATEDLY CONTACTED YOU AND TRIED TO CONTACT YOU WHEN B DIDN'T DELIVER THE MESSAGE A HAD TO CONTACT ME. WHY WHEN I MESSAGE YOU YOUR EXCUSE IS I TOLD B TO DELIVER THIS MESSAGE. DID YOU PAY B TO BE YOUR DELIVERY MAN? IS THERE ANY BENEFIT FOR THIS SLOW EFFORT? HAVE I REPEATEDLY TOLD YOU TO SETTLE TIME DATE LOCATION OF THE COLLAB AND HANDOVER?? I WAS SO MAD WHEN A & B CONTACTED ME ABOUT THIS. WHAT I THE COMMUNICATION ARE YOU STUDYING? VACATION? BECAUSE YOU SURE AS HELL WASN'T LISTENING WHEN I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN WHAT TEACHER ASSIGNED. NO, YOU WERE TOO BUSY CARING ABOUT A SINGLE STRAND OF MY HAIR FALLING OFF. I PRETTY SURE MY SANITY SNAP WHEN YOU TOLD ME That. I WENT OUT OF MY WAY TO REACH OUT TO THEM FOR THAT COLLAB YOU TREAT THAT COLLAB LIKE IT'S THAT FRIEND YOU DIDN'T LIKE CONTACTING YOU THEY'VE BEEN CONTACTING YOU FOR DAYS. DAYS!!! NOT MINUTES, HOURS, DAYS. DAYS.

THE TEACHER GAVE US 15 MINS TO DISCUSS AND CREATE OUR SLIDES. AND THE PEOPLE WHO GOT THE MESSAGE CORRECTLY? NO ONE BOTHERED OPENING A SLIDE, A DOCUMENT OR EVEN READING THROUGH TEACHERS SLIDE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION. I ASSIGNED A QUESTION TO EACH OF US? MORE LIKE I ASSIGNED QUESTION TO ALL OF YOU AND HALF OF YOU CAME UP TO ME WITH A UNO REVERSE CARD. At one point I just completely gave up. That week I was busy, tired, exhausted and fed up, I was mentally, emotionally, physically drained from helping out on an event organised the day prior and I knew that same day I had to go again till late night. I did Not appreciate the judgemental looks given when the only answer I was willing to provide was ""Look at the slides."" yet guess what. In that session only I presented in the group. One of you wrote a long paragraph in the chat answering the question. Yet you don't want to present because you're shy WELL GROW UP YOUR DEGREE IS COMMUNICATION. I BROKE DOWN CRYING I PRESENTATIONS TWICE BEFORE COLLEGE. I TOOK THIS DEGREE KNOWING THERE'LL BE A LOT OF GROUP WORK AND PRESENTATIONS BECAUSE I WANTED TO STEP OUT OF MY COMFORT ZONE I LIKED THE COURSE MODULES, I LIKED WORKING WITH GROUPMATES. BUT GROUPING UP WITH YALL MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I AM A LONE KNIGHT FIGHTING A 500 PEOPLE WAR. I THE MIDDLE OF EXPLAINING TO YOU GUYS. ONE OF YOU WHO WERE, FOR SOME REASON, BUSY LOOKING AT YOUR PHONE FOR A BIT COULD CUT IN AND ASK FOR AN EXPLANATION WHILST I WAS ALREADY IN THE MIDDLE OF IT. IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

IM NOT ONLY THE LEADER, THE TRANSLATOR, THE PRESENTER, THE TRACKER (WHEN ONE OF YALL CLEARLY WAS SPECIFICALLY ASSIGNED TO THIS ROLE YET YOU DID NOTHING ABOUT IT.) I ALSO THE FREAKING ONLY ONE I THE GROUP. THE ONLY THING KEEPING ME FROM SNAPPING IN CLASS IS KNOWING ONCE I SNAP I WILL UNLEASH HELL AND THAT ONE GOOD TEAMMATE WHO ACTUALLY HELPS AND TAKE INITIATIVE.

ALSO WHAT QUESTION IS HOW DO WE START? WHEN THE ASSIGNED TASK IS CONDUCT AND INTERVIEW. WELL DETERMINE TIME DATE LOCATION WHERE YOU CAN CONDUCT IT. CREATE QUESTIONS AND PROFILE OF INTERVIEWEE. HAVE YOU NEVER DONE A SINGLE INTERVIEW? A SURVEY? This is COMMON SENSE.

ANOTHER CLASS? CONGRATS THE WORK I ASSIGNED TWO THREE WEEKS AGO ISN'T COMPLETED. WHEN I TOLD YOU IT WAS DUE LAST WEEK LATEST.

AND ANOTHER MATE, WHAT QUESTION ARE YOU EVEN ASKING? WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS WHAT IS OUR TOPIC TWO WEEKS AFTER TOPIC IS FINALISED AND DECIDED.

Another CLASS WHAT KIND OF QUESTION IS ""MUST WE CONDUCT AND INTERVIEW"" when for the past semester this whole time. The teacher, I everyone else, the assignment brief NEVER SAID THAT.

ALSO WHO ORGANISES A MEETING AND DIPS ON THAT MEETING? I WOKE UP AT 5:30AM FOR MORNING MEETINGS. YOU KNOW THAT. BECAUSE ANYTHING LATER THAN THAT I WOULD BE LATE. YOU CANCELLED 30MINUTES BEFORE? ALSO WHAT AHOLE ARE YOU TO CONTINUOUSLY MESSAGE ME ON CANCELLING THE MEETING WHEN YOU COULD PROPOSE CANCELLATION IN GROUP CHAT AT 12 AM INSTEAD OF DM ME AT 12 AM EXPECTING ME TO BE AWAKE AT THAT HOUR WHEN I WAKE UP AT 5:30 FOR THAT. YOU COM MAJOR MAKES ME REALLY WONDER IF I REALLY NEED TO TAKE COM MAJOR.

""don't get angry"" This. This makes me want to get angry and release all my anger on you.

also the excuse of working etc does not CUT IT. I DO NOT CARE HOW MANY SIDE JOBS YOU Have unless you're giving me money, you can hire me, I CANNOT CARELESS ABOUT YOUR EXCUSES I OH I WAS WORKING SK I COULDN'T GET IT DONE. YOU WERE WORKING FOR ONE WEEK STRAIGHT? NO BREAKS? I TOOK ALL NGIHTER FOR A QUIZ I TOOK ALL NGIHTER FOR PRESENTATION. TAKE AN ALL NIGHTER OR LOSE YOUR JOB IF YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO BALANCE YOUR TIME BETWEEN STUDIES AND WORK. IT WAS YOUR DECISION FOR THAT JOB/DUTY. JUST LIKE IT WAS MINE DECISION TO DARE BEING GROUPED UP W YALL AND ACTUALLY HAVING THE HEART TO CARE TK EVEN TRY LIFTING OR WANTING A HIGH GPA WITH THESE SORT OF TEAMMATES.

GUES HOW MANY VIDEO EDITS, ANIMATIONS AND ESSAYS I NEED TO WRITE. BE HAPPY YOU GUYS HAVE THREE ESSAYS TO WRITE ONE ANIMATION TASK, ANOTHER 3 ESSAY TASK, MAX OFF THE COURSES YA TAKE BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE THE SAME MODULES. IM EDITING ATLEAST 1 15 MIN VID, ONE 30 MIN VID WHICH IS GOING TO INCLUDE MORE FOOTAGE SPERATELY SHOOTED LATER, AN ANIMATION, 3 ARTICLES, 3 ESSAYS. DEAL. WITH. IT. AND NOT TO MENTION THE AMOUNT OF DUMN QUESITON I GET ASKED. DO YOU THINK I DON'T HAVE A LIFE OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL? I LIVE WITH MY PARENTS WHO MAKES SURE I EAT EVEN WHEN I NEED TO RUSH WORK, DO MY CHORES, FIND AN INTERNSHIP, FIND A JOB, BE BETTER CONTINUOUSLY EVEN WHEN I BREAK DOWN THE BEST MY PARENTS CAN TO US SCOLD AND WHIP ME BACK UNTIL I UP ON MY FEET AGAIN. I GOING TO KMS AT THIS RATE BEFORE I STRANGLE ANYONE ELSE

If anyone at any point feel offended by these. Reflect. Think about how you make your teammates feel. Also to that one nice boy, sorry for not having group discussion in English I try to. But the girl won't stop speaking Chinese. So I speak in eng and she'll tell me to speak Chinese. Also to that really really really nice girl in one of my group and the duo group. You're low-key the best, your smile is pretty your eyelashes and long your facial features are beautiful and I honestly wish you a long life because you're so wholesome and nice as a group mate even when majority of the group doesn't speak a language you KNOW you learn their language a bit to try and communicate with them even tho it wasn't compulsory. You're literally what I aspire to be and you keep me going ILY I know you aren't going to see this. I fact none of you are.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Overcoming the guilt of leaving ur family behind…,2591399,itsalittlecold,"Jul 10, 2024 at 4:35 AM","I messed up the other week, I've spent a long time 'prepping' my brother and sister, trying to desensitise them to my death.
I got hold of SN, I decided to be noble & speak with my sister. As understanding as she is, I guess it's natural for her to do anything possible to 'save' me. We lost our parents at a very young age and I know them losing me too is going to break them anyway, so I decided to let my sister ring people and it resulted in me going to a mental health ward. Nothing has helped, they started me on new medication & now I feel in limbo again.. I suppose deep down, I've allowed it to go this way, so I can prove to them I really did try everything and hopefully now, they won't blame themselves.

How do people get over that guilt?

I got told I have adhd & bpd, adhd I knew I had. Bpd has opened my eyes a little and it's made me more certain than ever that I ain't fixable. I'm always going to ruin friendships and relationships, I'm always going to shut down and make myself believe I'm worthless.

All I wanted was a life with an understanding partner & family, I'm 29yr now and I've lost absolutely everything more than once, due to my brain. I don't even know what I do wrong half the time, I just know I'll always push away

I told my sister this time, they will be no warning as it puts to much responsibility on them. My plan now is to do it on the day of my birthday, in a month. That way, they only get reminded of me once a year.

Not even sure why I posted this, I guess I just needed to vent to someone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overcoming the guilt of leaving ur family behind…,2591419,mythofsisyphus,"Jul 10, 2024 at 5:03 AM","I'm not sure you ever do get over the guilt. For me, my pain doesn't remove my love and care for my family - it will always be there. This is what makes feeling the way we do so suffocating, because no matter what we do, there's intense emotions and pain attached to either option. It sucks, but I'm not sure there's any way of avoiding it.

I wonder if when we're in a place where we're wanting to get over the guilt, to make it go away, it's a sign our pain hasn't quite tipped the balance yet, that maybe our love for our family and care for them is slightly stronger than the suffering we're enduring, because we can't quite bring ourselves to face the pain we might cause them. Maybe it reaches a point where despite the guilt, the pain and suffering overpowers it. Where we can face the guilt head on and accept it for what it is, knowing that despite it, we need to do what we need to do. For me, this would be a sign I've reached the point where my decision is more certain.

Maybe right now, our fear of the guilt is something we should be listening to, maybe it's a sign we're not making the right choice? I don't know, maybe I'm chatting a load of shit, but just my thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Overcoming the guilt of leaving ur family behind…,2591452,itsalittlecold,"Jul 10, 2024 at 6:32 AM","I feel the same way. I guess maybe this is a form of SI… I honestly don't understand how our minds can convince us of one thing, then throw a spanner in the works, whilst simultaneously making itself feel nothing is worth it anyway.
Yeah I'm thinking it's another SI, maybe because we understand the pain and hurt so deeply, we don't want to be the contributing factor of our loved ones feeling as we did. We may accept our fate in ctb, but for some even in the worst circumstances will never understand the wanting to ctb… I think it should be pro-choice, no one should be made to suffer everyday without a miracle cure. However that been said, I don't think I'd ever come to terms with my bro or sis wanting to ctb. That'd break me in ways I'd never thought possible. Our mind is powerful, but yet weird.

I don't think it's a sign of not making the right choice, because no matter the love or support I receive from my siblings, it doesn't change how I feel on a day to day basis, my mind literally fantasises over ctb, I fluctuate from intense feelings of worthlessness to been a failure. I've never wronged anyone in life, I pushed them away before I could. But my conscious will always call for me to ctb… it's got to a point I won't even try anything anymore, cause no matter how good it turns out for me, I will mess up and I will be left in the same situation feeling the same all over again.",2591413,2591419,,,,,,,,,,,

There was a video posted here recently about a russian teenager who streamed his suicide on discord.

His dad came in and discovered his lifeless body and was screaming. Watching that killed me inside because I just know my parents would react in a similar way.

It's never going to be easy. I think even when we have nobody it's still difficult to overcome the SI.

God I fucking hate being stuck like this, absolutely ridiculous.

When I start planning my suicide I feel so sure about it, I tell myself that my family will be in pain and suffer but eventually they'll let me go and understand.

But then as the day nears closer to actual action, I panic, I start feeling emotional and I feel a lot of guilt. I don't know if I'll ever be able to do it. I have my method, but actually going through with it seems almost impossible.

It had to be partial hanging because there was no where tall enough to do it to the point of no return. I was in and out of consciousness but ended up standing up. I hate myself. I want to die so badly I don't understand why I stopped. I could've finally been dead. I probably would've. I felt very close to dying I'm so angry at myself. I would be dead by now. I wouldn't feel this way. It needs to end this is ridiculous. I've been suicidal since I was 11 I've done all the things to help. Medications,Therapists all that bullshit. None of it works. I've tried probably everything people say works and you're supposed to do. For years from 11 I tried to get better but there's a point where it's too bad. My reputation is ruined from all the attempts I've done. I need to be dead. I don't have another option that isn't just ""live in pain for the rest of your life.""

what I think i'm experiencing right now many of you would refer to as ""SI"" but it is not quite the same because I am not scared of death. the feeling doesn't have object or reason, it just is. I have even felt it come and go with the pain from being sick before I obtained my method. in any case im still confident its from illness and no rational place.

Overcoming Unnecessary SI,2591801,hematomatema,"Jul 10, 2024 at 1:26 PM","SI depends on the method. For things like jumping, the way of overcoming it changes compared to ingesting medication or whatever. Like, it's much more difficult to do a ""1, 2..."" then ingest compared to the same for jumping off a cliff or something.

The way I've done it before is to literally just blank out my mind. Stop thinking about anything (so long as you're absolutely, totally, 100% certain on CTB.) I just treated what I was doing as a typical activity, no different than brushing your teeth or grabbing something to eat. Just do it on autopilot. It's probably best to do this when you've actually prepared the method and can quickly do it because, since it's probably a new experience, your brain's going to notice that it's something you've never done before and bring you back to reality which might make the SI return. In the example of ingesting medication, I would prepare it in the solution I intend to drink as you would normally, but when it comes time to drink it, I would scroll through TikTok, watch funny videos on YouTube, etc., just grab a drink, keep watching and, oh, what I just drank was my CTB solution, cue preparation for death.

I can drive wherever want, and I've been driving on more rural roads recently. Roads where cars don't pass. Roads that are in the middle of nowhere. I know that I asbolutely won't crash into another car. And those isolated roads have big trees that I could crash into. Big enough to completely destroy the car. On top of that, I would take a big amount of opioids, alcohol, maybe even cut myself

You cannot be an organ donor if you CTB,2589415,ferrie,"Jul 8, 2024 at 9:41 AM","I keep seeing people talk about organ donation lately, and it's surprising how many people don't know how it works. The reason organ donation is so rare is because the body has to be kept on a ventilator until the organs are harvested. If you die before you are put on a ventilator, oxygen stops moving through your body & cell death begins. Organs that have begun to die cannot be transplanted. You cannot CTB & then be placed on the ventilator after. Really the only thing that may be donated if your body isn't already on support when you die is your corneas and some tissues. However, in the majority of jurisdictions, an autopsy is required when suicide is suspected as the cause of death, even if it seems obvious what happened. This further bars you from donating even your corneas & tissues because of the length of time it takes for an autopsy to be done.

There's clearly cases where organ donation is possible in the event of a suicide, so I'll admit that the premise of my original post is wrong. In my jurisdiction it's unheard of so I assumed that would hold true, but that's obviously not always the case! Glad people fact checked me. Definitely worth looking into the rules around organ donation in your area. I will stand by saying that I don't think you can reliably expect to donate organs if you plan to CTB. Even in the case reports shared here, a different transplant surgeon might not have accepted the organs, and in some jurisdictions autopsies are required for suicides. Mileage will definitely vary on if your organs can be accepted. I also think the goal for many people is not to be found to reliably ensure death which also lowers the probability of organ donation.

I kept going about my life like that for 4 years, getting more and more exhausted and in pain until I couldn't take it anymore. That+s when I went to the doctors who very promptly dismissed the severity of my problem and kept parroting ""physiotherapy"". Without having a clue about the severity of the issue, the therapists kept pulling the tendons and ligaments out of place, literally tearing the flesh from my bones. If the spine is like a pole, the tendons and ligaments, instead of following that straight line are now twisted around it, left and right and any attempt by the therapists to put one in place is only twisting and tearing the others. The amazing thing in all this? I've had CAT scans and MRIs and no one sees a damn thing, they look at them for 5 seconds, nothing that jumps at that so why bother looking further, so let's just dismiss me as being over dramatic. I'm not, I'm an extremely rational and stoic person who hanged on until the very last. Even if I can pay, my life simply isn't worth their time and effort. Most are just to dumb to even be able to understand the problem. I've read too many scientific articles that make it clear that the tendons, ligaments and muscles that hold the spine together are an extremely complex system and only doctors of true excellence can sort them out. But now it's such a mess I can no longer stand straight, can barely walk, I'm in extreme pain all the time that pills can do nothing about and my heart is in over exertion just from taking half a dozen steps to the bathroom.

JK. Sorry, I know this is a serious thread.

I think you tell him that you don't think he'll understand. Let honesty flow from you. Your mind doesn't work the same as people who are against CTB, so you hope he will try to understand that he can't understand. Let him know that you thought a lot about how to write this note because you want to minimize his pain, but ultimately you know there aren't perfect words because of the mental disconnect.

Another good thing, I think, is to make sure he knows that this was coming no matter what he did. Don't let him think it was his fault (assuming it's not) or that he could've done something to prevent it. The letter is for him, not for you, so I see no moral problem with fudging the truth. You've been struggling for 20 years. That's a fine line on its own. Maybe say that you would not have made it this long were it not for his positive impact on your life.

Maybe tell him how important it is to you that he move on after this. I don't know if either of you are spiritual or religious, but if he thinks you're watching him rooting for him to get past it that could help.

Also, it could help to make it clear that you've exhausted your options for recovery, or at least say that you've done your research and that this is not a snap descision. I'd even say ""To make sure it wasn't a snap choice, I waited until a day when nothing in particular was wrong, when I could be calm and accept the choice with a clear head"" or something like that.

Just a few ideas. I do think honesty from the heart is needed. It's your thoughts, they're your feelings, and it's your life. He's been a part of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Self Harm,2589630,EvisceratedJester,"Jul 8, 2024 at 1:54 PM","There is no such thing as a safe self-harm method. Self-harm involves harming yourself, it's in the name. At best, there are methods of reducing the harm you may cause yourself, such as, for example, cutting more lightly and practicing good aftercare. There are probably much healthier and safer ways to get that endorphin release, such as exercising. I'd recommend trying to find healthy ways to deal with your emotions instead of opting for SH. SH can lead to permanent physical and psychological issues and just isn't worth it.

Also, you should care about scarring. SH scars, depending on their severity, suck. I'm pretty sure I have nerve damage or something around my scars as they get itchy and hurt sometimes (especially when pressure is applied to them). I have to wear a sleeve on one of my arms and I constantly find myself readjusting it because it seems to irritate my scar tissue. It's also really uncomfortable when people take note of them (including those close to you).

Nicotine/vape juice as a method of suicide (potentially quite reliable given cheapness?),2586237,hematomatema,"Jul 5, 2024 at 1:01 PM","Was opting to jump but couldn't find a good spot, so I've been looking at alternative measures and found some studies on nicotine poisoning, particularly from vape juices and whatever other shit contains nicotine.

FWIW it seems really cheap and easy to access for basically anyone. The LD50 is probably at least >500mg (many sources list it as being lower - whether or not this is just some common misconception or if it's intentionally misleading to deter successful suicides, who knows) and I think it lies within or around the range of 1g, IIRC(?) but from what I've read, a far more reliable amount would be 2-4g. Nicotine doesn't have to be ingested either - can be absorbed through skin although I imagine this is far more costly and less efficient, but it doesn't require as much active effort or willpower as the ingestion, let alone more physical methods like hanging or jumping.

It's not particularly hard to find 20mg/ml 10ml solutions, at least from what I can tell, unless I'm misunderstanding it. Found this which I assume contains 200mg nicotine total (unless it means 2mg/ml, it's a little nebulous) and it's only like £2. Even if I am misinterpreting it and it really means 2mg/ml, that's £100 for 1g of nicotine to ingest for CTB - that's actually not too bad for a medication-style method, even if the actual process isn't exactly pretty.

As for the studies, I found this which mentioned a case of a girl who consumed ~2.1g of nicotine, went into arrest, had to have CPR done on her, and was otherwise in a very poor condition. Doesn't look like she would have survived had paramedics not made it to her. Same study also shows a guy who drank what I would have to assume was around 1-2g (but it doesn't really give many details and I can't find the original products mentioned) who also survived but had lost his pulse. Given the lack of definitive volume of solution ingested (just the mention of what products were used), I have to assume it wasn't the entire batch for whatever reason, which makes this method seem even more promising - the guy went through only most of the nic and not all and he still went into cardiac arrest.

This study, which I can't read (fuck paywalls), goes over the death of a woman who ingested 3g (making the 2-4g point seem far more accurate), was pulseless, had brain damage, the usual.

The 2-4g range might also be literal overkill as well depending on the age range (true for seemingly for very young and very old people) - this study mentions a man going into asystole with 600mg of nicotine ingested, far below the range mentioned (potentially lending credence to the lower ranges provided by most sources, although I don't entirely trust them as it is.)

And those were just the mentions of methods revolving around vape juices and whatever. There are other methods that can be employed as well that might end up being slightly cheaper and yet more effective/without the nasty fucking taste of vape juice in your mouth. Here is a study mentioning someone who attempted suicide after extracting nicotine from tobacco in water (seemingly incredibly easy, to be honest.)

There are a slew of other reports that mention these methods (particularly liquid nicotine ingestion, but there are still quite a few on the whole extraction-from-tobacco strat) but they all seem to be locked behind paywalls. Definitely not difficult to find them.

Thought I would post a thread on this since there really doesn't seem to be many mentions of it online, and I can't lie, it's looking like a solid method given the current lack of any good methods that don't require overcoming SI. Anyone who's tried this method or knows any more about it, it would be really interesting to hear what it's like, does it work, pain experienced during it, how long it takes to kick in, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

And just to add some value to my comment, some more shtuff:

Study 1: Brain death following e-liquid refill solution consumption, both orally and intravenously. No mention of which type or the total mass of nicotine consumed but it says only two refill solutions, so...?
Study 2: Near death after intravenous 1g. Table below in study gives a few more examples - seems co-intoxication with things like amphetamines or even alcohol could assist? Not exactly hard to find the latter.

Nicotine/vape juice as a method of suicide (potentially quite reliable given cheapness?),2587624,hematomatema,"Jul 6, 2024 at 6:54 PM","Will ask a couple questions if that's all good.

1. Any other co-ingested substances? Literally anything - alcohol, benzos, anything?
2. Do you reckon it was more the lack of antiemetics or the dose that screwed it up overall?
3. Any symptoms? Worst symptoms you experienced?
4. Did you go to hospital? If so, what did they say/do?
5. Do you reckon your low weight exacerbated the effects?

My gut's telling me it was probably both of those factors that screwed it up since the modern literature seems to place the lethal dose at the very lowest as being 500-1000mg, but I'm honestly not sure you're going to get anywhere near a lethal dose with that because you'll throw it up - this exact thing was documented with someone consuming 4 grams who then survived because they threw up (although symptoms were severe.) I think you need to ingest as much as humanly possible, on an empty stomach, and with as much concentration as possible, so as to minimise the amount you could possibly throw up and the rate at which it's absorbed. Injection would probably fare better too, but that's eww.

Honestly, from reading through a fuck ton of studies, if you take enough of the stuff (2g+ generally) it seems quite easy. The hardest barrier is avoiding the activation of your vomiting reflex which would just make you spew it back out so antiemetics are a fairly hard requirement here, but other than that, it does not seem difficult to pull it off, and if anything it's quite reliable. Without getting medical attention in time, it generally seems to follow ""Fast heart rate -> Arrest -> Brain doesn't get enough oxygen -> Brain damage -> Death"" and this is in all of the instances of deaths I've found.

There seems to be a skew towards people being alive after their attempts but this looks to be a combination of the actual lethal dose being grossly underestimated as well as being found in time - lots of instances record people going into arrest but living which seems unlikely if you're isolated.

Additionally, although this might increase the barrier of success when it comes to overcoming vomiting, it looks like adding co-ingestants of any kind vastly increases the efficacy. I've read through a case where someone took 3g (which, granted, is a lot, but there are people who have lived with that easily) but then had a couple shots of whiskey and died. Other cases where they've lived but had alcohol are also significantly worse in their outcome, so...

TL;DR - Antiemetics seem to be needed but if you take other random medications with the nicotine, and a lot of that nicotine in general, then it's actually really likely",2587453,2587486,,,,,,,,,,,

Really nothing at all. I'm sure meto or other dopamine antagonists would be necessary for this method. I actually called a relative two hours after out of desperation and they helped me find meto in the house... it worked real well so can confirm
It has to be both, I think having antiemetics at hand played a huge role, from my perspective I was feeling quite strong symptoms at the 15-min mark but vomited a couple of minutes afterwards. I think that's when I realized the plans were over for me
At the start it felt like a really horrible anxiety attack, heart racing, sweaty, shaky kind of thing, I think I fell a couple of times. The hardest to ignore/worst parts were dizziness, which was the strongest I ever experienced which lasted for a few hours, plus nausea/vomiting that was also very violent.
Also diarrhea for the rest of the day lol.
I did not, I concluded that I had thrown up so much that it wouldn't be worth it bringing attention to the situation. And actually nothing particularly worse happened after about 3 hours, especially after taking the antiemetic, lying down and trying to sleep
This is mostly an opinion but I do, generally larger doses of certain substances are needed to be effective on larger individuals, and children are at risk for poisoning with smaller quantities of something due to their size. I would assume the same 250mg would be less dangerous for a different person. Either way it's better to overestimate, and I didn't because I was acting impusively and couldn't get more at the time.

Many people die of CO poisoning in their sleep each year caused by faulty furnaces and plugged-up chimneys, and I can all but guarantee that the levels that kill them, are nowhere close to what can be achieved by burning charcoal, intentionally, in an enclosed space.

CO has been the ""go-to"" method of suicide for decades. It was the prevailing method when cars had no catalytic converters. Using charcoal is just another iteration of that method, and an improved one, I would argue. If someone does their homework on it, and takes the necessary steps to ensure success - correct charcoal, enough charcoal, burning charcoal correctly, right enclosure sealed properly - the CO method has an extremely high reliability of success.

2:40h - (Crushed) 4 mg Lorazepam + 20 mg zolpidem
3:00h - 25 g SN drink

Any advice on this?

Being in my room, where I spend most of the day, I don't feel any fear, outside my mind begins to ruminate, but I won't back down. When the time comes I will mix it like someone stirring a medicine that dissolves in water and I will drink it. I will play the mp3 and lie down to wait for the symptoms, nausea, irrational panic... I will hug the pillow and scream to release tension, I will refuse to call an ambulance, because the pain will be temporary, the fear will be temporary, enduring what enough I will achieve my purpose, which has more value than anything else.

There's still until that day, so I guess I'll take advantage of the thread to tell a little about my life later. I would like to be able to use my phone and narrate what I am doing and feeling, but it is very likely that once I ingest benzo and hypnotics my mind will become lazy, but I will try. And since there will be traces of it, I will say it now:

No one has forced me to take this path, no one has coerced or incited me to do so. Those who know me well know my history, this is my wish, mine and onloy mine. I want to end my life, it is mine and I have that right to choose whether to abandon it. I can't stand this world anymore, living with pain and feelings that cause me great regret, and that is why I am leaving. That's all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,2550954,Onelegman,"Jun 6, 2024 at 12:36 PM","All the hotels I found were very expensive and depressing, they were not welcoming but cold, some hotels even did not have a bathroom in the room, but a common one in the hallway. more than €100 to piss in the hallway!!! We are crazy? hahaha I wanted a quiet place, with a bathroom that would allow you to vomit if necessary, Wi-Fi and air conditioning. Many hotels have an air conditioning duct in the ceiling and blow air into all the rooms, there is no way to regulate it, it is as if you connect a tube to a fan and give air to 20 rooms on the same floor, it really is of no use. . And the Wi-Fi is terrible in hotels, I suppose you have experienced it on some occasion.

On Airbnb I have a whole house, not very big, but cozy, proper air conditioning and high-speed Wi-Fi, ideal in case I want to masturbate or write here.

The owner will not have to take care of my corpse, I will leave the note warning that they will find my body inside the room, that they will not be there and call the emergency room, police or whatever comes to mind. I guess it's a risk to take when you rent... zero empathy with these people, who buy houses like crazy to renovate them a little and see the money fall into their pockets.

,2565641,Onelegman,"Jun 18, 2024 at 5:03 PM","I guess it's time to tell my story, although I doubt many people would be interested, it's always good to let off steam...

I was born healthy, I crawled in my crib and I almost went bald from rubbing myself against the sheet and the bars hahaha

My first memory is a green inflatable pool on the beach, my first birthday present at 4 years old were 4 white label transformer robots that I loved.

In preschool I learned everything I could, letters and numbers, I even read and wrote. Something that doesn't seem normal today. I felt intelligent and capable of taking on the world. I only had one friend (that makes me realize some things now)
I started primary school and I was surprised that they weren't at the same level as me. I was a good student, I got very good grades and I loved going to school.

I don't remember when the bullying started, the school was in another town and I had to stay there to eat. I had a group of about 6 friends, and for some reason, they started insulting me, harassing me and hitting me. During a medical check-up, the doctor almost called social services because I had bruises all over my body (more than a naughty child should have) I couldn't take it anymore and had to confess what was happening... but I lied about the most important thing. I didn't want them to know they were my ""friends"", so I said I was an older child.

I started going to a psychologist, with such bad luck that one of them also went... at that time bullying didn't exist, it was ""kid stuff"" but my persistent mother managed to get measures taken. The measure in question was quite hard for me. Whenever I explain it, no one understands it at first, but I'll try to explain it:

I had to stay after lunch, almost 3 hours next to the teacher. When someone asked, he told them that I had been punished for doing something very very bad, and that I would be punished for the whole year. I was like that for 2 years, quiet next to the teacher, without being able to talk to him because I was so small that adult matters didn't interest me. Luckily sometimes I had the gameboy or I colored photocopies of the manga dragon ball Z (saga of bu)

After those years I finally finished high school and changed to a high school 15 minutes walk from my house. I never heard from those bastards again. Except that the leader's mother died of cancer. Call me a psychopath, but I was happy about it. He deserved something of that caliber. When I was 12 years old I went half my body over the railing of the terrace, I don't know what stopped me. My sister, 6 years older, didn't, she was next to me, I suppose from fear. Same sister who 2 years earlier sexually abused me. I remember that she undressed and then me. And that while we were doing it she didn't pee on me... it took me a long time to realize what she had forced me to do. She was 16 and I was 10, I guess she was studying human reproduction and wanted to learn something first hand... damn sick girl.

High school was harder, but I managed to get by until 2nd ESO (I don't know what year it is in the US educational system) where I started hanging out with a somewhat rebellious kid. Silly me. Here, like everywhere I imagine, depending on your performance you go to class A, B, C or D. I was in B, and I don't understand how this being ended up there, I guess before there were fewer students per class and they were filled until they all had the same number. People studied a lot, including me, but after spending the summer with that guy, in 3rd ESO my grades went down and down. I repeated the year and was forced to pass by law, I failed 7 subjects but the law said I passed the year anyway. In 4th ESO I turned 16 and left high school to work and help my family financially.

There is something I haven't said, and that is that at that time, I met a pretty girl, kind of nice and with a very good body, as well as a nymphomaniac... I, with my hormones raging and depressed for being a burden that couldn't get my head up even when I was studying, found paradise. Brunette with green eyes... anyway... We spent a year together, she was very toxic, another term that wasn't used or known before. Very jealous, pathologically jealous. I ended up cutting ties with my friends, getting along badly with my family... all I wanted was sex with her. When I realized it was too late and after several breakups, my mind was broken. I had been single for a few months and mulling over the idea of suicide, I worked hard and was poorly paid, I was a minor and my first job, but I held on as best I could. I started studying a course to be an electrician and the holidays arrived. I had already planned everything, I couldn't go with my family to the beach because I had the course and work... The day before my first attempt I went to the town festival and drank cheap alcohol (something like normal alcohol mixed with another of lower quality or adulterated). It tasted awful and I left early because I couldn't stand the reproaches of my ""friends""
The idea was that, once they entered the autonomous community (what we could call a State in the USA) they would warn me. I would jump and die, they would take me away and they would know my fate thanks to the letter I left them, just 2 pages. BUT, they didn't warn me. I still remember hearing the elevator door and their voices. I panicked, threw the letter on the floor so they could see it and went to the terrace. One foot on a chair, another on the railing and then I stepped into the void. 7 floors of fall, I counted about 3 seconds, I noticed that my body was twisting even though I fell straight as an arrow (the neighbor next door saw everything and warned them) and it hurt, as if I was being stretched on a medieval torture rack. I hit the ground and broke all the bones in my legs, my hip, my coccyx, and I crushed two lumbar vertebrae. A kidney also ""drooped."" I didn't lose consciousness, I didn't feel any pain, only the ego of having failed at something as ""basic"" as killing myself by jumping into the void. People were crowding around, shouting, talking and whispering. The neighbor had notified my family, they came down immediately. My father put a jacket under my head and my mother asked me what had happened. I thought, wow, I'll bleed to death before the ambulance comes, and I told them that I had fallen when I looked to see if I saw their car coming.

There is a health center at most 200 meters away, someone ran there to notify them and several professionals came, I didn't feel anything, a comforting warmth, nothing more, I suppose it was my blood soaking the clothes. I don't know what they did, tourniquets or something like that I imagine. The questions didn't stop, how old are you? What happened? Don't fall asleep! The ambulance finally arrived, more questions and more lies. I don't know how much time passed from the moment I was thrown out until they put me in the ambulance, the last thing I remember is that I was getting in, I saw the roof of the ambulance when they induced a coma. I spent 15 days in an induced coma, 3 operations and many nightmares. I woke up during an operation, they were scraping the pus out of my muscle with a scalpel and so that they wouldn't go overboard I just said ""hello"" and everyone present turned their heads in fear. They ran and sedated me again with a mask. It was funny in a way. I lost almost all of my right leg, it reaches the height of my balls. I was hospitalized for 3 months until I could sit up, and a year to be able to leave rehabilitation. I had 2 prostheses but they made very deep wounds because I didn't support myself on the end of the stump, but on the groin and under the buttock, and I risked contracting sepsis, so after 2 years of trying, I decided not to take the risk. At first I wasn't affected (because of the sedatives) by losing my leg, but every year my mental health got worse because of it.

For several years I graduated from high school, took courses and vocational training in computer science, graphic design, web design and even accounting, in which I was always at the top of the class. After one of the design courses the professor hired me in his advertising company. After making their website, the woman in human resources asked me to stay with them, paying me with sex. I didn't know that I now had integrity. I didn't report it but the company went bankrupt soon, and I was glad. I got jobs but my pessimistic mood, social phobia, BPD and everything that it entailed made me leave some while in others I was fired before completing 1 year. Here they give financial aid to companies that hire disabled people, but they only give the aid once a year and per person. They fired me and hired another disabled person to ask for the aid again... scoundrels.

The second and pathetic attempt came with a cable and a radiator at 26 years. A noose from the movies and at a low height, I spent 20 minutes suffering and got nothing except a red mark and a sore throat. I called my partner at the time and checked myself into the psychiatric wing of my hospital. 13 days of suffering later they discharged me because they needed a free bed. They took me off the medication and gave me another very powerful one, so much so that I only had to take 1/4 of a pill. I lost all emotion, desire to do anything, eat, and I was not aware of time, when I finished eating I would watch a series for a while and when I looked out the window it was nighttime. Like a zombie. Weak and very sleepy all the time.

Then the worst thing in a long time happened. I don't want to leave a very long post so I will summarize it as much as possible.
That woman, who I wanted to marry the following year, hurt herself with a hammer on the head when I fell asleep after lunch and called the police. She woke me up bleeding on top of me while the police went up to the house. Long story short, 5 months in jail waiting for trial and 3 and a half years locked up in a mental asylum. One of so many hells on earth. All that time without knowing if I had really done something like that. When I finally managed to get out, not without mental after-effects, I discovered that she had hurt herself thanks to a computer recording that was activated when it detected movement... I was preparing the complaint against her and the justice system for my unjust confinement when she called me through a second-hand app to confirm what I already knew... she said that she wanted me to be cured, to be taken care of and to be able to be together again... that everything was done to get me help... idiot, now I had a confession, so to speak, of what had happened. And while I was waiting for the trial, an old friend of both of us met me at the doctor's office, and told me that she had confessed the same thing to him a few days after it had happened. Conclusion: a lot of money from the State, a public apology from the judge who sentenced me and her declaring herself insolvent to pay the compensation. With feminism on the rise, she didn't have to serve a prison sentence, just a fucking fine! Despite the final sentence, the videos and everything else, most of my family still think I'm a woman abuser. The world is crazy!!!

Since then I've been cloistered at home with my parents, they're older and we help each other. I only have 1 friend that I see every so often, sometimes for months. The only contact I have had with women after that betrayal has been with prostitutes and I have zero interest in having a relationship with any woman (dating apps and the impossible standards of girls infuriate me) and I am somewhat afraid of being falsely reported again, this is very fashionable now in Spain, where men have been stripped of the presumption of innocence in cases of gender violence. And right now I will have gone 2 years without touching a prostitute, I am not even interested in sex anymore, I have reached that point... I do not recognize myself.

In prison I tried to cut myself with a knife but I was unable to. I do not even consider it an attempt, they looked like cat scratches. Finally, at the end of April I tried with nitrogen gas, but something (I suppose a spasm) knocked the bottle over and disconnected from the tube that connected it to me for breathing. I will never know if it was the nitrogen or the enormous disappointment and depression that came over me after failing that caused the paralysis of half my face... I suppose a bit of both.

And here I am, shattered, waiting for the 29th to come around so I can take the SN. I have everything I need, benzos, EO, SN for a dozen glasses... I could only fail in one way and I would drink another dose if it happened...

And that's my life...

Let's assume you actually know what you're doing (rare), and the mess cleanup under control. I think it might actually be possibly less traumatic.
1. Doesn't include chemicals or potential body damage, that's one plus
2. No bulging eyes, chemical odour, and other similar stuff
3. Very swift death in full awareness

Counter points would be
1. Decapitation in and of itself can be traumatic to people. If your family members would be the ones to find you - maybe reconsider, at least location

Otherwise doesn't matter too much because your death will be defeating to them regardless and they'll suture your head before viewing in most places.

,2591537,sunflower_sunset,"Jul 10, 2024 at 8:34 AM","first things,, hey i'm new here and pretty ready to ctb. the only thing causing delays is method.

i'm annoyingly smart and rational so i know that unless i have something that can pretty much guarantee death, i won't do try it. i have tried to od 3 times but it clearly didn't work and i think i chose that method because i wanted this 'peaceful & painless death' that i'm pretty sure just doesn't exist.

so i'm branching out on ideas. so far, three have caught my interest, but the practicality is not quite there. good thing is, i'm happy to take my time getting the plan together.

option 1: partial hanging. now bare with me, i haven't researched that hard so i'm still lacking some understanding on it but it also seems like a pretty seamless method, easy process, not a huge clean up (i live with two autistic people so the less they have to see the better). my big thing is i'm 70% sure SI would kick in for me before i reached a point where it was effective. is it advisable to try using any opioids or meds to lessen my comprehension of what i'm actually doing to myself? also, i weigh a lot. i'm a morbidly obese 22 year old, so how would this change things for a partial hanging, if it does change anything at all? i have a good idea where i can do it and being the outdoorsy type, i have access to the rope i need so its really just about actually putting the idea in motion.

option 2: SN. i've been reading up a lot on it, purely out of curiosity whilst i waited for my membership to be approved. i understand the idea of it, and i kind of get what you need to do but i definitely need to keep reading up on it. realism on it though: i'm broke, i live in the UK (from what i've read i gathered the uk thing just makes it less achievable) and i don't know what state it will leave my body in to be found. as i mentioned above, i will be doing this in my flat because i can't afford to go anywhere else and i know i won't be interrupted before i'm beyond help. i have a dealer so getting H or F is not a huge problem if i need it alongside the SN (just assuming i need it based off the info i already gathered about SN). like i said, still need to research this one a little more to decide if it is even a possible option for me.

option 3: gunshot to head/ roof of mouth. again, i live in the UK, so i can't just nip to the shop for this. but, i've lived a pretty respectable lifestyle so far so the chances of being approved for a gun license aren't far from the realm of possibility. i would probably need to join a shooting group for a few months before applying for a license and in that time i can save money for an actual gun. out of all three, this is the most likely for me to follow through on. i say this because even though i intend to plan this properly, when it comes down to that final moment, it needs to feel somewhat do or die (ironic i know). if it's a split second choice that's pretty much irreversible, that's going to give me the opportunity i need to do it. to clarify i'm sure of it what i want to do, but im also human and you know, SI.

i also have ADHD so everything i do lives in the world of compulsion, which means as much as i have an idea of when i want to do it, i dont have an exact ctb deadline and i think once i have solidified a method and have what i need for it, i will just then have to wait until the moment it right. i want to get this right because to be honest, i have a great support system and i know that if it doesn't work, i'll never get the chance again which sounds idylic except the idea of living knowing everyone knows what i did will kill me before anything else does.

but yeah, any advice on which idea sounds like it would suit me best would be appreciated. i know people cant openly say which one but if anyone has some facts or experience with any of the options, i would really appreciate it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2571974,Artemisia,"Jun 23, 2024 at 4:08 PM","Yesterday I was, once again, told there's no hope of anything resembling a normal, pain free life for me. So, I got home and started working on my process to end this misery. My chosen method is chemically produced CO and I intend to share how it goes. It may take weeks until I finally go through with it but I'd like to share what I learn along the way.

So, to make CO it takes formic and sulphuric acids. I ordered formic acid online without any incident. Formic acid at 85% is enough and sold freely to treat beehives against mites. Although at that concentration it's said not to degrade, it's better to keep it in the fridge.

I couldn't get pure or at least 90+% sulphuric acid. However, could get, without much trouble, battery acid, which is 37% acid and the rest is water. However, refining it isn't all that difficult. You see, SA has a very high ebulition point. So what do you do? You just have to boil it! I did it in a Pyrex bowl, because concentrated SA eats away almost everything, including inox. I actually left it unattended for too long and got a cloud of SA in the kitchen, but doesn't really matter at this point (I live alone and who gets the house gets to fix the kitchen how they want). The final result is concentrated SA at about 90%. You know it's there when it eats away a paper towel leaving only a tiny bit of black residue. From what I read, 90+ should be enough, but since I know a bit of chemistry and it's not that difficult, it's better to be safe than sorry. I ordered a simple distillation kit and it should arrive soon. I'll share how the next step goes then.

This is my 90% SA, looking nice and yelowy!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2572419,frost_,"Jun 24, 2024 at 1:55 AM","Thank you for making this thread, I also feel like high concentration Co is the most peaceful, at least according to what I've read.

First, I was thinking about a generator, but not only are the exhaust fumes hard to breathe in, it's loud and will continuously run electricity and generate more CO after death which is a fire danger to surrounding property.

Charcoal thing seems a bit too manual and imprecise, it's possible but can vary based on what you buy, how you stack it and light it.

Chemical seems the most direct.

Are you using the gulps method? I didn't read far enough, not sure how to get rid of the water portion that gets generated in the reaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2572629,pthnrdnojvsc,"Jun 24, 2024 at 6:32 AM","I think even lower concentration of sulfuric acid should work.

Any setup needs to be tested to see what actual concentration of co is achieved

Needs to be tested with very small a few ml amounts outside. like in a small reaction chamber and with the tpi 707 meter or another one if that is too expensive. Then do the math to extrapolate to the larger suicide chamber.

For example if can get co if 2% In. A 1 cubic meter container. Then you would need 100x for a 100 cubic meter chamber",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2573345,Artemisia,"Jun 24, 2024 at 6:02 PM","All those years studying chemistry turned out to be useful after all! I feel the same way, generators are too messy and properly lightig all that charcoal just seems like too much trouble and not enough guarantee that it'll work. Getting a CO analyzer that can read 10000 ppm turned out an extremely difficult quest for me, so at least this way I can estimate how much CO is produced.

Yes, I intend to use the gulps method, although I'm a bit worried that oxygen masks have holes to let the CO2, we produce when breathing, out. Won't it dilute the CO somewhat? Probably not significatively, but I'm the kind who always would rather be safe than sorry. I like being prepared.

You don't have to get rid of the generated water, it's part of the process. But it's also why you have to start with the highest possible concentration of SA.
It could work at a lower concentration, but not as well. This is the reaction:

HCOOH + H2SO4 -> CO + H2SO4.H2O

It works because the SA (H2SO4) dehydrates de formic acid, stealing 2 hydrogens and 1 oxygen to make water for itself! If there's already a lot of water in the solution, the SA will bind to those free molecules of water instead of breaking down the FA.

The gulps system uses a closed system and an oxygen mask to deliver directly to the nose and mouth. I haven't fully decided yet if I'll use that or try to fill a small bathroom. Need to do some math for that.",2572419,2572629,,,,,,,,,,,

,2573408,Artemisia,"Jun 24, 2024 at 7:12 PM","Lucky you! I'm actually envious, as I have to refine my SA and there's not much I can do about my 85% FA.

I don't think there's a smallest amount possible, the reaction works in the same proportions no matter the amounts used. Just keep in mind that you need at least twice as much in volume of SA than FA. I've shared the stoichiometry of the reaction in another post. Let me try to find it.

This is the equation, already balanced:
CH2O2 + H2SO4 = CO + H2SO4.H2O
1 mole of formic acid + 1 mole of sulfuric acid = 1 mole of carbon monoxide + 1 mole hydrated sulfuric acid

CH2O2
molecular weight =46,03 grs/mol
density = 1,22 grs/cm3

H2SO4
molecular weight = 98,079 grs/mol
density = 1,8356 grs/cm3

CO
molecular weight = 28,01 grs/mol
density = 0,00125 grs/cm3

We don't care about the H2SO4.H2O!

The GULPS method consists of using 50 ml (50 cm3) of formic acid and 250 ml (250 cm3) of sulfuric acid. I was curious, how much CO does it really produce? (Keep in mind that without heat or agitation the reaction my not be complete)

50 ml/cm3 of CH2O2 weight 61 grs (1,22 grs x 50), which is 1,325 mole (61 grs / 46,03)
250 ml/cm3 of H2SO4 weight 458,9 grs (1,8356 grs x 250), which is 4,679 mole

This means we have an excess of sulfuric acid. About 1/3 would be enough to react with all the formic acid, but I guess this is to make sure there's enough and then some more.

How much CO does it produce then? The formic acid is therefore the limitation, from 1 mole of CH2O2 we get 1 mole of CO. From 50 ml, which are 1,325 moles, we'll get the same 1,325 moles of CO (if all the formic acid reacts, which may not happen due to the conditions in which the reaction happens). And how much is that? 1,325 moles of CO are 37,113 grs (1,325 x 28,01 grs) or 29690,4 cm3 (37,113 grs / 0,00125). That's 29,69 liters!!!

From 250 ml + 50 ml you can get 29,69 liters of CO! Now I understand why it's so effective!! I'm sincerely impressed!

Just to take it one step further, considering we want at least 10000 ppm, meaning 1% of CO in the air, the amount of CO produced is enough for 2969 liters of air or 2,969 m3! So, theoretically, you don't even need a mask, you could let the reaction happen inside a small car and quickly get in and it'd most likely still work.",2573397,,,,,,,,,,,,

If enough reagents are used it definitely should work in filling a small closet, bathroom or even a car. CO is slightly lighter than air, so it'll always rise.
Stirring is always a good idea! I had considered putting the glass jar with the reagents in a hot water bath, but I'm not sure I'll have the energy to try that out. See if it'd make a difference, for better or worse (it may actually generate too much heat). The reaction is exothermal, so it kind of perpetuates itself.

Theoretically yes, but it's probably even more unreliable than what I'll be testing. Both butane and propane will burn with a nice blue flame if they have enough oxygen, if the flame is yellow it means there isn't enough O2 and CO is most likely being produced. I've achieved some success by simply slightly unaligning the burners, but have no idea how much CO it was actually producing, I very much doubt it was even remotely near enough to what we want, but it definitely can be done.

But that didn't really make sense no matter how long I thought about it. I believe the brain is an information processor, similar to (but not exactly the same as) a computer. If the brain is an information processor, then it would be possible to describe the state of that information processor as a set of data, maybe a long string of binary data for example. This long string of binary would change all the time as the brain processes information and its state changes. But I can't imagine how a long string of binary would be conscious. It makes no sense.

So now I feel like there has to be some magical thing separate from the brain that ""experiences"" life and is conscious, although I'm not really sure. You could say that this is the soul. If we go with this assumption, then everything starts to make more sense. The brain is an information processor which processes information from the outside world and its internal state, and communicates that information to the soul. Things like visual processing, memory, language, and emotions may be part of the brain, while the soul only does the actual experiencing of all those things. Maybe the soul also contains a person's ""will"" and is able to communicate its desires to the brain.

But you could also say the universe can be described as a big set of data as well, since the state of all atoms and particles could be described as data somewhere. If that were true, then the existence of consciousness itself would make no sense, because that goes back to the problem of a piece of data being conscious.

It can feel like it sometimes. When you meet someone that you click with so well. It feels so special. Then, you start to think about how lucky you were to even meet. What the odds were against it and you wonder if it was supposed to happen. I'm not sure I really believe in that now. It's just a nice idea in a way.

It's a difficult thing to define though. Is a soul our personality? I'm not sure we think about a soul without assuming it to be an individual personality but without a body. Do newborn babies have a personality? Not really. Yet, we'd probably still like the idea that their soul went somewhere nice. But, that kind of assumes their personality/ character is pre-determined when, who we are surely depends on our life experiences, as well as our genes.

I'm not sure I believe in any of it now either. I think it's just a romantic idea that we cling to because we don't like the thought of losing our loved ones forever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I abuse diet pills as well and restrict my eating, I can not even finish a meal.

In August 2022 I collapsed on my living room floor with no energy and the way my heart was beating it was not normal beating. Prior to the incident I took a much higher dosage of laxatives and appetite suppressants combined throughout the week.

I thought I just needed more water because there was a heatwave but the next couple of hours later I couldn't stop throwing up and the vomit was a clear liquid. I could feel my body just shutting down even walking up the stairs I found extremely difficult as I had no energy. I went to bed to sleep it off and I felt fine the next day but I was so scared I was not going to wake up. My body was so weak and i thought my heart was going to stop beating.

That was my most scariest encounter with laxatives. I admit that day I was actually terrified of death and was relieved when I was OK. My life did get better after that encounter and months later were the best months of my life. 2023 was the year everything went wrong and I finally just gave up on life.

it's a painful way to die for certain, but I'm not in the place of judging people for their chosen methods often. if you think there's even a chance you'll change your mind, maybe stash a bottle of potassium supplements in your house somewhere.

In the Autumn of 2022 my life was finally coming together. I began to feel real happiness when I went travelling then weeks later coming back from my travels I managed to successfully find a higher paying job in a large corporation. Winter was soo magical. It was snowing in the UK and during my lunch break I was in the park. For the first time in my life I was looking forward to the future and finally began to see life as a beautiful thing. I had the most amazing Christmas ever I brought loads gifts for my family with my salary. I was falling in love with an older man in his 50s because he made me feel so special in a way no man has ever done.

2023 everything it all went wrong since first of January I had things constantly going wrong so many things. In January I was forced to see my toxic relatives overseas I was so miserable at the airport on New Year's Day because I loved the freedom of never seeing my relatives again during the covid19 pandemic. It was so hard seeing my relatives because none of them care about me and the only relative who did care about me died. Being in that country everything reminded me of the relative I loved so much. I have the worst relatives in the world.

I struggled at work so much in my role. My boss even cruelly mocked my immaturity and blamed me for bringing problems to the department. The older man I fell in love with cruelly played with my feelings with his mind games and lying, He messed me up so badly. He humiliated at work along with the assistance of an older woman colleague who I thought was a friend. Our boss was his friend and believed all the lies he told about me. The management saw me as an immature young woman besotted with an older man it was so humiliating.

I got fired in for underperforming. My eating disorder came back and got discovered by family. I was so determined for things

The only good thing I had that year was getting into a masters programme at one of the top 20 universities in the UK. 1 week when I was ready to collect my student ID last minute tuition fees I was forced to defer a year.

After that I finally gave up on life. Nobody understands how much getting into that university meant to me. It was the only good thing I had in my life.

● I can't got over the man I love, no matter what I do I can't get over him and he caused me so much pain. I admit the heartbreak feels like a lifetime. It's the worst pain this man has put me through and he has messed me up.

● I am so upset everyday because this year is when I should have been preparing for final exams and graduating. Being forced to defer is one of the worst things to happen to me because it put me on the path of self destruction. Now I am going to lose my university place.

● I hate my relatives now more than ever. My grandmother paid for her brother to go university in the UK and this brother is now wealthy. He is a wealthy arsehole who looks down upon family members and NEVER helps a family member who is in need of financial help.

My grandmother and mother always help these relatives in every fianacial emergency they have or crisis in their families and now when I need help NONE of these relatives show up. I needed help paying a £5,000 enrolment fee the university required to start the course. There were relatives who were able to help but NEVER help. £5,000 is nothing to wealthy arsehole uncle but uncle just loves showing off money while preaching about being a good Christian yep.

Trying to be normal ruined me,2591060,-nobodyknows-,"Jul 9, 2024 at 7:50 PM","I was okay for a good while. Got off medication, got a job, and started hanging out with people again.

That last thing was probably a mistake. I'm not great with people, I get way too attached and I'm incredibly awkward. I'm usually quiet and reserved, but when I purposefully make an effort to interact with people I tend to come off as way too forward and direct. Naturally, other people aren't too fond of these things.

I'm in quite a conundrum. Staying away from social interactions makes me feel like my life is pointless. But the lack of connections after putting in effort just makes things so much worse.

I wish I had someone. In the past, whenever I did, things were a lot better. It's ridiculous how much of a difference it makes. But, it doesn't ever last. I get way too clingy and just want to be around them too much. It's not just romantic interests either, I get like this with friends too.

I hate that I'm like this. I can't stand the thought of always being on my own.

here's the plan -

i will be seperating 25g sn into two clean plastic wrappers(candy/similar wrapper, i couldn't find a good wrapper ) and seal it with tape for extra protection from moisture. and keeping them in another small plastic container in my pocket.

will do about 8 - 12 hr fast and no water for last 3 hrs. then i'll take 1000mg paracitamol and 30mg domperidone at e.g. 12 am and 12:10 am and will go to washroom with a water bottle and my weight scale, mix both sn into 2x 50ml water. first cup will also include 8x to 10x 40mg propranolol.

I'll drink the first cup at about 12:55 am and put the second cup under my bed in case i throw up within first 15 mins.

if i throw up, my parents might wake up, i will send them asap and take the second cup and sleep under blanket and with a pillow to cover my stomach (breathing). I'll have atleast 6 hrs before anyone tries to wake me up.

so my questions -
1. is it okay to keep small amounts of sn seperately since they are already kind of exposed to air, and i need them after like 6-8hrs.

2. can i also crush propranolol and keep it for later?

3. if i don't throw up, then the second cup will be left under my bed, will it convert to nitrate in about 5 or so hours? i don't want anybody else accidentally touching sn.

anything else am i missing? any other suggestions? thanks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

How I almost CTB with water - on accident -,2590989,anonymousfoxxo,"Jul 9, 2024 at 6:18 PM","I'll open up with, I like to take warm baths. But this time was different.

My story to be told in less words than my original thought line goes like this:

I took my heart and blood pressure medications at a much different time than usual, hours later, and I felt overall pretty bad and careless the night. Things clouded my head, still do, about what tomorrow may hold, about stuff I don't have, stuff I have but may lose. Doesn't matter much though, what matters is that I was rather careless and went ahead to bath.

I usually make the water very hot, so hot that I look like a lobster, truth to be told, when I'm inside it. Now this time I had some stuff to do so I left the water to flow, the hot water only, it's only after that I start to add Cold. But I wasn't in there, and the bath filled a lot. Adding cold water to it and it almost overflow, and I have a phobia of drains from childhood, so I didn't let some water down the drain to have space for cold water. I didn't care. I just went in. It burnt but I didn't care much about it. Eventually it started to feel nice and I laid down. Music on, and laid in there for a while. Fast forward to some minutes later I take a cigarette and start smoking as per usual.

This time around however I was pretty dizzy before I smoked too, and I didn't pay attention to the warning sign. I smoked, and got even more dizzy. So I put down the cigarette and laid back in the water once again, whole body submerged, and the boiler is right above my head, which started dripping cold water on my face. To counter that I put the sponge on my forehead so the water falls on that instead. But the sponge was hot too.

So with that, fullybody under hot water, dizzy, and wrong time meds, and all I noticed was a sudden rush of tingliness in my entire body, random shivers, and the music fading away.

Now whatever may have happened there, somehow my head stay on the edge of the bath, so I didn't drown. I woke up like a hour later , when the bath was colder , had no idea what just happened, for a little bit, until I remembered. Head hurt, body ache, and my skin started to come off on my hands and face, which was uncomfortable, not much painful though until out of the water. Now i'd describe it as itchy pain rather than pain. Anyways decided that was enough for a bath so I tried to get up and out. That's when it hit me, I had no strength to. So this is that embarrassing part of the story. I lived, only to then try to get out of bath. Really embarrassing. My nail broke as I tried to get out by pulling at the edge, but slipped. I looked at the watch, it took half an hour to figure out how to get out.

In the end the method was to roll on my stomach, curl up, sit, turn around, slide my legs under , sit again, and then grabbed one of those handles made for handicapped people (an old lady lived in this house before us). I could pull myself up just enough to have a crouch position, and my legs were strong enough to get me up and out. Then came the second hit when I had a rush of hot all along my body, and my vision get those stars again. I ran over to the chair and ended up fainting onto the table next to it. That probably broke my fall because my head doesn't hurt right now, apart from a migraine.

And then I woke again, had a rather fast heartbeat but I was fine. I don't know why I lived. But it was quite the experience. Maybe you'll giggle up on this one, or maybe you'll feel my pain and embarrassment. Whatever it is you are having, thanks for reading through my whining again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

OP, that sounds horrendous. How are you feeling now? Make sure you stay hydrated and if you've got any concerns, get yourself checked over by your doctor.

I was with you completely trying to get out of the bath. A few years ago my shoulders locked up while I was asleep in bed (bad posture, innit). I had been asleep on my side, flopped into front because my muscles screamed and then couldn't move my upper body. I tried the whole ""Lassie, get help"" on my dogs but they were utterly useless. I ended up using my knees to crawl like a slug in reverse down my bed until I eventually got my feet on the floor and was then able to do some shuffling and heave myself upright.

I mentioned being stuck in my front to my doctor and the panic of not knowing how to get out of bed and to cheer me up she told me about the time she bought a very expensive pair of wellington boots on a whim one summer as she'd had an argument with her husband and wore them when she got home to walk the dog as it was raining. She said it was also really warm and her legs swelled up and of course she couldn't get the boots off and so she was cross with them, cross with herself and still cross with her husband and sat on the floor trying to pull them off, when something went in her back. She lay on the floor trying to stretch it but it didn't work and she couldn't get up again, and had to wait, still stuck in her boots, now in pain and furious at the world, for her husband to get back while the still wet dog had the run of the house and the comfy furniture.

It will suck ass but I think opioid tolerance goes down pretty quickly like matter of days, but that may increase the effectiveness.

I'm also hoping to use fent but will be relatively opioid naïve. From what I hear combining with benzos + alcohol + antiemetic will dramatically help for success.

I'm thinking of combining methods like using the fent to take away fear and pain of jumping, taking just a bit extra right before the jump in case I survive the fall etc. Or fent+drowning, fent+asphyx/inert gas maybe buying a big deep freezer and passing out inside or some other hermetically sealed area that would otherwise be intolerable.

These are just thoughts though so may I ask your help?
Because you now have a lot of experience with 'what it is like' to be on fent. Do you think it is powerful enough to mask the pain of say smashed legs and guts while slowing bleeding out if I botched a jump attempt? Or enough to slip into the unknown and not even be aware I am drowning etc?
And based on your experience, would it take a high dose (relative to tolerance only, not specific dose which will vary by person) to mask such dramatic physical and emotional pain?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

A. Okay, I've taken it, and I'm in a state. Then a kind of revelation I guess they talk about right after ""the jump"" -- about certain people in my life and what's going on with them, sudden clarity. That happens.

B. Sudden removal of emotional pain and psychological shift to acceptance of death. There's an ease and mindset shift.

C. Waiting. From there it was a choice -- accept the bliss of acceptance, or fight against what's happening to you.


So the fentanyl can and will take you from A to B most probably. You'll be aware of your smashed legs, you'll be aware of your guts, you're not going to be oblivious all of a sudden -- but you're not *primarily* aware of those things, because you're too preoccupied with OD'ing. How much depends on how much you'll take I'd guess, take enough you'll just black out and at that point it doesn't matter. You could absolutely get high enough to where you're not even noticing or just, frankly, don't care.

Yes it would take a high dose to mask those forms of pain, I sat through every second staring it right in the eye, waiting -- you'd theoretically need a lot. The bliss people talk about? I didn't really get any of that, it really depends on your focus. If you give into it totally? sure probably, but the way I did it just left me feeling pretty awful. My advice would be follow protocols described and actually ""get high"" -- do what people who take the stuff do, properly, or you're just going to feel like you're drinking battery acid mostly.

i don't want to play this game of life,2584606,Darkover,"Jul 4, 2024 at 3:42 AM","I'm not exactly a ""n00b"", as I have been playing this game for the last 30+ years, so I think I have a pretty good feel for the overall story, game play, etc by now. I've got a pretty decent character, graduated the tutorial, completed enough of the campaign (solo and co-op), learned many of the basic skills and even some more advanced techniques, collected a few achievements/trophies along the way, and yet, everyday is a burdensome chore. The only reason I am still playing is because pretty much everyone else is enjoying some part of the game (or at least appearing to?), they are relying on me (guilting me?) to keep playing for some reason, and/or they feel stuck/trapped since this is all they know and maybe there isn't anything else to play anyway.

I've never enjoyed playing but people kept telling me it would get better later so I continued. I've tried various jobs/classes, locations, equipment and medications, and... yeah, I'm pretty sure this is it. This is the core game play and I find no joy in the playing/doing.

So, at what point am I allowed to just set it all down and just walk away? When I inquire about deleting my account, I am met with anger, confusion, and threats of punishment like being hurt, banned, fined, etc, (which is like, yeah okay whatever, take my red party hat too because I'm deleting my account) I am somehow still surprised by it all.

NOT Reliable Methods To CTB (MEGATHREAD),2539695,Forveleth,"May 28, 2024 at 6:26 PM","Unfortunately, the human body is made to keep the blood on the inside and getting a significant amount of it outside of where it's supposed to be is difficult for a number of reasons.

Problem 1: Platelets. As soon as damage occurs, hormones are sent out to recruit platelets to the damage site. They immediately react by becoming ""sticky"" to plug the hole (form a ""clot"") and slow the loss of blood. Platelets do a really, REALLY good job of clotting so long as you have enough of them in your blood and, unless you have some sort of disorder that affects your platelet count, you do! And no, things like aspirin, NSAIDs, or alcohol do NOT thin your blood enough to override clotting. So, as soon as you cut yourself your body is immediately fighting to keep the blood in and your body usually wins.
Problem 2: Veins. Most people go for veins because veins are near the surface and easily visible (they're blue). But veins are tiny. Trying to get a significant amount of blood out through a vein takes forever. Imagine trying to drain a bathtub through a drinking straw. Also, the fluid pressure in veins isn't very high so your blood just kind of lazily drips out. Now, throw in platelets doing their job and you are way more likely to clot off and stop bleeding before you could ever get enough blood out of you to die.
Problem 3: Arteries. Alright. Let's go for the big tubes! These are the ones bringing the red, oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of your body. The tubes are bigger and they're under high pressure! Except they are also buried deep in your body, usually under layers of nerves, tendons, muscle, and even bone. Arteries are a vulnerable part of us so they are well protected. While they may be larger than veins, they still aren't huge. Blindly cutting or stabbing means you are unlikely to hit one of these. Ok, look at some anatomy pictures online. If it were that easy, there would be a lot more surgeons in the world! Unless you have practiced cutting open other humans, you aren't going to know where to cut to find an artery. Even if you could, there is still one giant obstacle in the way...
Problem 4: Pain. One of the major issues with ctb. Your body will fight you tooth and nail to avoid pain because pain means damage and damage could mean death. It is fundamental and will override pretty much every single conscious thought you will have. Most people can barely break the surface of their skin willingly because of our hard-wired fear of pain. If you want to get to an artery, you're going to have to cut deep. Not just into your skin, but all the way through your skin and through whatever else is under it while making precise cuts. This is surgery. You have to perform surgery on yourself while wide awake. It takes surgeons years to learn this and you think you're going to get it right first try with your shaky hand while fighting your own SI? What if you miss with the first cut, do you really think you're going to have the fortitude to take another try?

Some other things to consider:
Time. Even if you hit an artery, it can take time to bleed out. This gives SI plenty of opportunity to kick in and get you to call for help. Why not take a sedative/drink to help relax? How are you going to make those precise, surgical cuts if you're half asleep/tipsy?
Having the right tool. A lot of people just use a knife they happen to have laying around. There is a reason surgeons don't just use any old knife. Human tissue is tough stuff and it takes an INCREDIBLY sharp blade to get through all of it. Dull blades actually do more damage because they ""tear"" tissue instead of neatly ""cutting"" it. So many people who try to cut themselves end up with...
Lasting damage. Whether by using a dull blade or hitting nerves and tendons, a failed cutting/stabbing can have debilitating effects. You can lose the use of fingers, hands, even whole arms/legs or damage nerves to where you are in constant nerve pain the rest of your life.

TL;DR: For successful cutting/stabbing you need precise anatomy knowledge, steady hands, the ability to withstand a large amount of self-inflicted pain, the fortitude to override SI for however long it takes to bleed out, and enough time alone to bleed out before you are found. All of that combined gives a success rate of just 1-2%. Failure often comes with scars that people are not proud of and potential permanent damage. It's heavily discouraged for these reasons.",2539562,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jumping can work if you can jump from a high enough place and land on a hard surface like water or concrete. The largest problem with jumping is finding somewhere that 1 does not have a barrier to jumping and 2 does not have constant surveillance for jumping. Unfortunately, it's very obvious when a place is good for jumping, so it's usually heavily monitored to prevent such things. Also, SI is very difficult to overcome with jumping.

I’m finally done,2591335,suicidal flapper,"Jul 10, 2024 at 3:03 AM","My dysphoria won. I spent 32k to look different only to look the same. Money I had to scramble for and lucky I even had because the circumstances of getting it were not pleasant. Hormones didn't work as I appear to be estrogen resistant. Facial feminization didn't work. It's over. I have nothing to continue for. Being trans has finally taken its toll on me. I wanted to live but I'm in too much pain to continue life.

I truly hope for a cure in the future. No one deserves this disorder. It's not a good thing like the media paints it as. It's horrific and unbearable. I spent 10 years in total home school isolation in a lonely dark room while being verbally abused every day. I used to think that sense of isolation was the worst pain I had ever felt, but I was wrong. It's this. A constant agonizing feeling

I had things I wanted to do. I had hobbies I wanted to pursue. Maybe if I transitioned when I was a teenager I could've avoided male puberty but I couldn't come out. I had no options.

I'm scared but the pain is just too much. At some point I'll probably write my story of how I got here but I don't suppose it matters too much",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Warning signs are a must and don't do it if you have neighbors in other floors of the building. People will smell the ""rotten eggs"" over miles. You cannot do it in a big room - failure risks are too high and you may not pass out and die quickly enough. You can use a tent inside of your room or the mask.

It's a failure risk. After you pass out you may still breathe but you can't control it anymore, there might not be enough H2S near the floor where you probably lie after passing out. Too risky to fail imo. Use a tent or mask.

It is important to be able to exhale CO2 bc if you inhale CO2 in too high concentration SI will kick in. CO2 won't react with H2S both are very stable molecules, afaik.

H2S isn't very common as it seems to be more unpleasant and very dangerous to others. Others can smell H2S over miles (rotten eggs). Don't forget about that fact.

"I hate when people misconstrue my problems or make comments like, ""you're just a little depressed""",2581926,KuriGohan&Kamehameha,"Jul 1, 2024 at 10:46 PM","I feel like it makes a mockery of everything I've had to endure for years to chalk it up to, ""oh you're just a little depressed."" What even??

The main reason why I became long-term suicidal is due to chronic physical health problems that have been ongoing for years and baffle everyone around me, including those who are meant to be experts. Anyone who knows me very well knows that this is the main source of my day to day misery, ever since I was a teenager I had chronic fatigue syndrome and the symptoms have really spiraled out of control the past few years.

That's not to say that I don't have other issues contributing to this deep seated pain, I certainly do, but I would say my poor health is the biggest driver of it. To understand how much it hurts, I think one has to truly comprehend the sort of person I was before I became so ill. Due to my abusive upbringing and growing up in a shithole location where there were absolutely scant opportunities, I was incredibly determined to flip my lot in life and escape the desolate environment that I grew up in.

I was doing pretty well at it too, for a short while. When I was about to turn 16 I went to live with a foster family and was able to start going to school again, I put my best efforts into studying and took the most difficult courses possible to try and make up for lost time. Even then, I had no energy and was over medicated, didn't get enough to eat at home or at school, and couldn't do any after school activities because I was just so, so tired, but I was very determined to change the outcome of my life at that point.

I faced a lot of bullying and even harassment from teachers for being autistic and unable to make eye contact with them. Any time I made a mistake they thought it was purposeful and I would sometimes be taken into a spare room with teachers and yelled at, insulted, and told that I should give up studying and learn the trades despite me being a small, physically weak girl with no coordination. Some of my teachers were friends with the student who molested me several years before that and I think they held a grudge towards me because I reported him.

Yet, I still didn't give up. It all came crashing down a year and a half or so later though, when I got back to back viral infections and ended up with chronic fatigue so bad all I could do was lay under a blanket of permanent exhaustion. I lost my job (which I needed because I was still a minor at this point and no one was supporting me) and people began to regard me as a lazy, unmotivated faker. This also made me very sensitive and anxious to the point where I could no longer tolerate how I was treated at school and requested to do my work at home on a medical leave for the last month, but none of the staff at my school cared and I was made out to be lazy and mentally ill as a pejorative.

Despite this, I managed to cope enough to get back on track a couple years later and go back to studying after escaping an abusive relationship. My body could not handle physically intensive jobs even as a teenager and the cracks were beginning to show, so it felt like if I didn't get back into education I was going to buckle and end up homeless if I couldn't do these jobs. I was treated for severe vitamin deficiencies that had gone undiagnosed for years, but nothing really improved. At age 19 or so it was apparent that I was developing some sort of peripheral neuropathy, and the chronic fatigue really dug it's claws into me.

I was on vitamin regimines, prescribed stimulants and everything else under the sun, but nothing improved. My blood tests would ping pong back and forth between showing some autoimmune issue, and showing nothing, so I could never get any sort of treatment and my PTSD prevented me from being able to keep engaging with the healthcare system to the extent that a ""normal person"" would because doctors had absolutely no tact about the fact that I suffered SA from a doctor at a young age and didn't respect me at all. I'm autistic and go mute or freeze in states of high overwhelm, so advocating for myself is difficult if not impossible sometimes.

I spent years in different therapies for my PTSD that did nothing at best, and psychologically harmed me at worst. I have been on pretty much every psychiatric drug you can think of too, save for lithium and antipsychotics. I also tried pretty much every single psychedelic drug, despite this people would continually tell me that I just didn't want to get better, didn't want to recover and somehow my physical health problems were manifestations of trauma that I somehow wasn't addressing. Not having this support from others has really taken a toll on me in the long run, and I can't come back from it, I feel like.

Eventually it was revealed that I had a 13 cm tumor in my reproductive organs alongside several smaller tumors and cysts after I spent months with agonizing constipation and GI issues. It was so difficult to get a scan and I had to pay out of pocket for it because the most commonly used (because it is cheaper) scan involves vaginal penetration which I obviously cannot do, I can't even insert a tampon, and the healthcare staff just acted as if I am a petulant child over this. There was also scar tissue and blood everywhere in the abdomen, so basically a ticking time bomb. Yet after surgery, I felt no better overall, except my constipation is now more mild compared to the hell I went through then. Still there, but at least not horror movie levels of it.

On top of all this, I started developing back pain a few years ago. Doctors wouldn't help me with that and kept sending me to physiotherapy, who would email me sheets of exercises to do and then get mad when they didn't help me. When I didn't do the exercises a couple weeks after I had surgery, they told me off over it and kept insinuating that my issue is that I'm not active enough despite the fact that I dont have a car and walk everywhere. Once again, had to pay again to get another scan because they insisted my back pain was due to me being LAZY.

Well it turns out I have multiple degenerative discs, scoliosis, and it looks like some kind of inflammation. Maybe even ankloyding spondylolysis, but my bloods have come back negative for the high risk antibody so I'm just screwed on ever getting a useful diagnosis, I think. Even then, the only pain relief offered is just a stronger dose of an ibuprofen analogue that doesn't do shit. When I am in the throes of pain, those things do absolutely nothing. The only thing that's ever helped my pain is small doses of cocadamol but these gatekeepers won't give it to me, so I'm just expected to suffer my entire life if I do too much activity, stand too long, or am forced to sit in a chair all day.

My fatigue has gotten worse and worse over time to the point where some days I can drink a cup of coffee and still fall asleep immediately afterwards. I've been dealing with peripheral neuropathy type stuff for years but I would say over the past couple years it's cranked up significantly, not only do I have the 24/7 numbness and tingling in my limbs but I developed Raynaud's and my circulation is so poor my limbs feel heavy and low-key burning all the time, and I'm very sensitive to temperature. While over time I adjusted to this somewhat, I am not exaggerating when I say I'm uncomfortable 24/7.

Recently I also found out i have a structural abnormality of my brain where my cerebellum descends into the spine slightly known as Chiari malformation. Of course this is yet another problem I have that is not taken seriously whatsoever or I'm told that no doctors know about it and it's impossible to have it fixed surgically unless you have the most severe forms. So I have to live with constant pressure in my head, which sometimes is merely uncomfortable but on other occasions can result in a lot of pain. My vision is fucked up and I've been told it's neurological as opposed to an actual problem with my eye, but they don't really know. I also have permanent tinnitus for over 10 years now.

Hands down the biggest hits that I've taken though are deterioration in my attention span, learning, and memory. I finished my neuroscience degree and did quite well, but I barely managed to complete final year. I was signed up to do a masters course and the entire year I have had to defer every single assignment and have much worse grades. I even failed a module for the first time in my life, and my university has strict policies so they refuse to offer me a resit. I am always the stupid and slow person, who people cannot believe used to be extremely intelligent in childhood.

Here's the thing, throughout all of this nightmare, I have tried to fight it, and have a positive attitude, but there is always another horrible thing that inevitably pops up as a fixture in my life. I don't have any family members left to support me, compounding the struggle. I have PTSD not only from sexual abuse but the sheer amount of death, decay and watching people I care about getting seriously injured that I've had to experience throughout my life. I have nightmares almost every other day, especially involving worse forms of my grandmother falling in front of me, hitting her head, shattering her hip and arm, and hearing her scream for half an hour not knowing if she is going to survive.

I exist in a perpetual state of waiting for the phone call from a hospital to tell me that my grandmother has died, as that will truly mark me being alone in this world with no unconditional love left. My grandmother is the only relative I have left and she is very far away from me and also close to the end of her life. I am stuck in a mutually toxic marriage because as my partner succinctly stated, ""few people would want to put up with me."" And it is obvious I cannot work to the extent which is necessary to support myself independently.

Every day, I feel like a complete shell of a person and robbed of all the things that make someone feel human like having energy, skills, intelligence, fitness, love from others, creativity, etc. Other people genuinely do not seem to understand the extent to how bad my situation is and won't believe it, with my closest and only friends constantly stating bullshit like, ""You just need to appreciate the small things like birds chirping outside and not focus on the negatives."" I don't see how I cannot focus on my poor physical condition when it is effecting every single aspect of my life on a daily basis. My dreams are constantly crushed by my limitations and I'm told I should be happy with a mediocre life where all I would do is lay in bed and listen to the birds.

They also say things like, you are ""just depressed"" and it isn't the actual issues I'm having that are the problem, but my mindset and reaction to them. This is so deeply offensive to me, because not only is it insulting and downplaying the struggles of people who are clinically depressed, but it assumes that I should just be happy and content with all of these struggles and I am personally failing by not having the ""correct mindset"" which in their opinion is believing that things will get better no matter what. The latter might have been a fair point in the early stages of my decline, but after 8 years?

One of my friends says suicide is never a logical or rational decision and it is always 100% because you have clinical depression. He keeps pushing this view on me and saying I am only suicidal because I am in denial of being depressed and stubbornly reject the label. This fundamentally makes no sense to me because I have things that I enjoy and want to do but it became harder and harder the enjoy anything the more my health declined, I had a real passion for my subject and really wanted to get involved in medical research, I felt genuine joy when I could accomplish and achieve something, and yet this person (albeit in good faith I suppose) continues to misinterpret my situation and say that I'm just in denial of having depression??

It's like when I say I have brain fog people will say I'm in denial of having anxiety, when I don't really panic about anything, I don't have social anxiety, and I don't experience fear unless I'm having a PTSD episode, but surely I am completely unaware of how my own body and mind feels and some stranger knows better.

I'm so sick of people fundamentally misunderstanding what the actual problems are here. There's also the added context that for many years I would complain about physical health concerns only to be fobbed off and told that I'm mentally ill instead. Whenever I couldn't go to the bathroom for months and had to take horrible medication and enemas that made me wake up several times a night and left me in awful pain, I was told that my constipation must have been me making bad lifestyle choices or I'm having a mental illness. Then it was actually caused by a tumor. So I'm incredibly sick of this logic where anything that someone doesn't understand automatically gets called a mental illness with no justification.

I wish suicide was easier for me. While I do fear death somewhat and all of the inherent unknowns, what I hate the most about the entire process is knowing that where I am now, every time there is a suicide it gets investigated and the person's entire life gets put on public display for others to read, tarnishing whatever privacy they had beforehand. Inevitably, my problems would get chalked up to some abstract concept of mental illness as well and not the horrific life I have lived for the past 25 years. I just want to be left alone and die in peace.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's definitely frustrating to have your suffering as ""just depression"". Well, depression certainly is a real and serious thing but when they say that they definitely aren't giving the full due weight to your suffering.

My friend with clinical experience said depression was my first and foremost issue. I thought that it was hide telling that he would say that. Because autism is. Why exactly am I depressed? Come on. That just tells me he doesn't have really understand the impact autism has. Which is par for the course for pretty much every NT out there, even those working in mental health or have personal relationsiops with autistic people. I suppose there must be exceptions but I haven't encountered any.

Then he says mine is "" mild"""". Lol. I'll be 32 soon and I have no degree,no job much less a career, no home of my own, no romantic experience and certainly no prospects for that or a family, no life worthy of the name. Immense alienation and disconnection. It eludes me why I had to be brought here just to have a gimped life.


So my situation is similarly dire but like you I have found it hard to get it going even as it grows direr and direr with each passing day. I wish I had a mediocre life that sort of, kind of confirmed to the conventional vision of what a 32-year-old's life should be, but I can't even have that.

Of course good things don't tend to fall into our laps and I tried. I put myself through fucking calculus when I'm not really a math person in NY renewed quest for a degree and worse than that I put myself in an environment that made me feel like my mind was ablaze with a wearing fire and that made me want to die every millisecond. But it worked for a while such that people in my life thought I turned a permanent corner then it came crashing down in a fireball. I guess miracles can't sustain themselves forever.

You can spend hours building an intricate sand castle and all it takes is one strong wave to wash it all away.



The lack of equity in life truly is astounding. You'd think there might be some sort of cosmic law of averages where blessings and curses balance themselves out but nope. Some people really are storm drains for all the bullshit life can toss people's ways.

Stupid absolutist position is stupid. My friend's comment is also relevant here. He also has an absolutist attitude to the topic. You could say most (100%) non-impulsive suicides that occur after long deliberation (so basically like on here) are due to *unhappiness* with life but conflating that with or dismissing that as depression isn't sound. But that's another matter.

For me autism means existing in a fundamentally and irresolvably state of dysphoria and a state of perpetual grief and frustration at having been forced to exist and live my own life with this condition.

""Would you talk to a therapist about that?""

Please.



I wish it was easier for me too. It feels like it should but it isn't. I just know things are growing more dire and dire. I hate it.

Yes, I agree, the death investigation is the worst part. Even it won't be relevant to us and even if we can rationally see why it is necessary, contemplating it just sucks. It sucks to think about the idea of being dissected, both physically and psychologically, and subject to the same old judgment as we were in life, on the part of the same institutions. It's just absurdly funny to me that even in death there is no escape from that. Any death investigation ruling a death a suicide will try to explain the decedent's motivations as evidence for that decision and I'm sure they get misinterpreted all the time or like you said chalked up with pity and scorn to mental illness. I know inquests in the UK have more of the nature of a public spectacle than in the US, which is even more unpleasant to consider.

Things like my health problem won't be given due weight either which is really horrible to consider. But to find freedom and shelter from life all these qualms are just something we have to find a way to get past.

I hope it is at least some consolation that if you kill yourself, some people have real understanding of what had driven you.",2581926,2581926,2581926,,,,,,,,,,

"I hate when people misconstrue my problems or make comments like, ""you're just a little depressed""",2583776,KuriGohan&Kamehameha,"Jul 3, 2024 at 10:34 AM","Thank you, I needed to hear this. It's true that I don't need validation, despite that pesky urge for it, because the only ones who ever really knows you is yourself. Others may try to glean some sense of understanding, but they can never fully grasp all the complex intricacies of what makes you yourself, why we think and feel the way we do, and so on. It helps if your experience is more in line with the norm, but like you've said, my situation is exceptional.

I think that contributes to this very deep sense of isolation. Every time I dealt with the mental health industry throughout my life, the staff would always say things like, ""never dealt with a case like yours before"" or ""the medical services aren't meant to deal with complicated issues like this, things work best when there is one solid, well-defined problem, not multiple"", so where does that leave me then.

Years of being invalidated and treated like a crazy person have made me desperate for acknowledgement, I think. I am grateful to have this site and people like you who are keeping it real. I don't have a soul in real life who actually understands. There was one point in time where my partner would say that when I experience pain is ""convenient"" and insinuating that I exaggerate or make it up to get pity. I have a headache right now that feels like someone is stabbing an ice pick through my brain, I really wish I was just faking it like others think. Having to deal with this sort of rhetoric for ages probably did actually, ironically make me crazy and broke me down.

I feel like people deal with issues better when they are short term and there's a clear path to recovery. In situations like mine, there's inevitable castigation because no one wants to deal with a person whose going to be negative forever. Which I've really tried not to be, but even compared to a year or two years ago I feel like a husk of a human, withdrawn and bitter. I can only really put a mask on for work.

At least kind words like yours make me feel vindicated. Because I know deep down, that what I'm experiencing is real, and even if other people cast doubt, they're not the ones who have to be disabled and worn out every single day with no hope of a treatment or cure. I already have another tumor it seems like from an incidental scan and I don't want to deal with it right now because if I lose my ovary I'll probably start early menopause and the host of problems accompanying that shit. Thank you for your wisdom.

At the end of the day no one can stop me, if I plan meticulously enough.


The ignorance surrounding autism is astounding, the new wave of autistic pride (as opposed to accepting autistic people and actually trying to HELP them instead of pretending we are all misunderstood geniuses) is really hurting the cause, I think. Your friend jumping the gun to depression rather than attempting to understand fundamentally what autism is and what sort of effects it has on adults. How is struggling to such an extent considered mild by someone who touts themselves as an expert?

Here it mentions that 40.2% of autistic adults in a population were depressed and also that experiencing depression is a consequence of feeling as if you lack agency over your life, which as autistic people we often do because there's no treatments or interventions for adults. All support is geared towards children only. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168804/ If that doesn't address the elephant in the room that ones circumstances can make them miserable, I don't know what would convince someone who is blind to the impacts of autism.

You have every right to be angry that you couldn't finish your degree, or work, or find a partner. Those are things many NT and able bodied people take for granted every single day, especially when autistic people tend to be viewed as either perpetual children, being severely intellectually disabled to the point of requiring nursing and home care, or highly functional, self sustaining introverted quirky savants. We see autistic children in the media all the time, but rarely does anyone talk about what happens when inevitably those autistic children grow up and enter adulthood. We don't just stop being autistic, but the responsibilities of the life script certainly don't take this into account.

It's admirable that you gave the calculus course a go, even if it did end up not working out in the end and being something completely overwhelming, over your head, and painful. At the end of the day, you have the satisfaction of knowing that you tried, and others can't take that away from you or dismiss your efforts. I can relate a lot to the brain on fire feeling, I absolutely hate the working and university environment which is why I've always been on the cusp of losing it all and can't work full time like I am expected to.

Years and years of alienation do take a toll. Recently I do thing the zeitgeist on neurodiversity and the like has made things worse for people like you and I. Whenever I opened up to neurodiversity activist type people about how I felt frustrated about dyspraxia, sensory difficulties, and going mute or unable to communicate, they would just insist society is the problem and not my very, right in your face level of obvious neurodevelopmental disorder that is by definition an abnormality that has hindered my life. People could be nicer, but how is that going to stop me from wanting to tear my skin off if a pair of jeans is uncomfortable or feeling like my brain is exploding if the neighbour is singing loudly and badly. Come on guys.

One day this will all be just a distant thought, a blip in the grand scheme of things, you're right about that for sure. At least I can find solace in that fundamental truth that one day whatever pain and worry I've experienced is going to fade away into oblivion. It's taking awhile to get there, but I know I'll find that peace eventually. Even if I have to save money and fly to South America hunting the holy grail, this nightmare is going to end some day.",2581968,2583002,,,,,,,,,,,

Even though he says he has many autistic patients clearly there are still a lot of gaps to fill. But how much is reasonable to expect a NT to get, even those who work in mental health? It's like learning a second language. Even if you get a very proficient grasp (which is of course quite the challenge) there is always going to be that last 10% (let's say, could be more or less) that is inaccessible to you, whether it be pronunciation, syntax, shared cultural knowledge, or whatever. But I am certainly depressed but it's not ex nihilo.

I certainly have never felt my life belonged to me.

The worst part is that I have a non-autistic identical twin. Enough said.



To be clear I passed that class and got an A in that class. That was the my final semester before I dropped out (for the 3rd time) and did get straight A's. So it wasn't the academic side that drove me out, more so the psychosocial. it's hard to explain. I have intense social anxiety (to use the common term as I don't think that captures all of it) and intense social sensitivitt and over stimulation problems that go way beyond the autistic norm. Which has been the main theme of my life so it was disappointing to be bested by my eternal problem when so much was at stake. So the social anxiety is what caused me to feel on fire.

The calculus program was part of a biology problem so although I said it wasn't the academic side it was also true that it was only going to get more intense and focused. As o know you know in STEM fields there surely is no shortage of students vying and jockeying for opportunities; in fact, it could be said there is a glut. So if you have certain impairments and problems you're going to have a very tough time standing out and competing unless you are outstandingly exceptional à la The Good Doctor (piece of shit show by the way). Needless to say, that does not describe me.

Still, I wish I has been able to see it through and keep engaged in something instead of settling into NEETdom like I have been in the past several years. I thought I had left that for good even if I ended up killing myself, but I guess not. But I do think that even if I had manages to sustain that change, eventually the weight of everything would prove to be too much and I would CTB before I got too old. But I wanted to at least give myself the option (and part of pursuing, maybe the main reason, was to do something in light of the fact that suicide was so hard).

And nothing is definitely stopping people from dismissing my efforts. Even though I out myself through a grueling hell inearch of that mythical ""getting better"" and lasted as much as I could to a humiliating conclusion, it's still not enough. But remember like you I have had to suffer my health ailment all alone so people necessarily underestimate what I have gone through.

I just got audibly upset typing that out. I'm over it all.


Yes eventually but I'm out of time. I have several years on you. If I could palliate and earn a meager livelihood that would be better but I can't. I certainly wish I has pentobarbital. I chided myself for not procuring it through here when it was available but I see fork recent news that I may not have had much luck unless I had ordered back in like 2019 possibly.

"Overcoming Anxiety, SI When Suicide is Logical",2591257,dazed.daydreamer,"Jul 10, 2024 at 12:40 AM","I'll keep this brief for now, but can elaborate if anyone wants more details. After many years of trying to fix myself and my life, with seasons of suicidal ideation and parasuicidal actions, I've come to the conclusion that committing suicide is the best course of action, for both myself and others. I've thought it through many times over the months and years, and any other reasonable option has fallen through.
Now would be a good time for me to CTB, circumstantially. However, I haven't been able to bring myself to fully complete my preparations or go through with it. I keep procrastinating, distracting myself from directly thinking about it; when I do manage to sit with my reality and this decision for a moment, I'm filled with nondescript dread and anxiety.
I'm logically at peace with the decision and *want* to die, and am frustrated that I haven't done so yet, but the feelings of anxiety and dissociation are getting in the way.
I know I want to die: any advice on overcoming these feelings, the SI?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overcoming Anxiety, SI When Suicide is Logical",2591272,lacrimosa,"Jul 10, 2024 at 1:07 AM","I can definitely empathize with you on this and there's no right answer that I could possibly give that would convince you one way or another... and... it's being stuck in the middle that is a major pain in the ass.

This has been a dilemma for millions of people over the years and some whom are stuck in the middle turn to harmful or risky activities (addictive and dangerous drugs, extreme sports, gambling, etcetera) while they distract themselves in limbo, hoping the risky behaviour will eventually lead to their demise or diminishing their quality of life to the point where they have no choice but to CTB or be homeless and destitute. Very masochistic behaviour, as is suicide, but suicide, in its purest form is the ultimate escape from this pain and the human condition.. It is more merciful, especially if you have a chronic condition or diagnosis. But... in the meanwhile, this masochistic behaviour acts as a salve in lieu of CTB because the anxiety and dread the idea of suicide invokes is so powerful, along with SI.

So, you have three choices... Live as a shell of a human and distract yourself and suffer until you're pushed to CTB. Get treatment/recovery and find meaning in life which will eventually lead to you finding joy (hopefully). Or CTB, which is a very tough decision to make and it's so final and if you're suffering from existential dread, probably not a good choice as your gut is telling you not to.

***NOTE - Those are my 3 choices at the moment and there are probably more options that I am just not seeing, because I am in the thick of it...

I hate dealing with such intense emotions of anxiety and stress. I was doing fine for a while, I'm certainly not in as deep of a depression as I was like a month ago but I feel like I'm dipping back into it again slowly. I hate how it eats away at you until there's nothing. I just want to be normal. Feel normal. I don't want to feel so worthless all the time. I'm creative, but I feel like all my friends create far better things than I ever could at any given time. I have this problem (probably some people would not see this as a bad thing) where I shift my hyperfixations so starkly and so quickly that I feel like I can't master anything. One week I want to read, then I want to draw, then I want to learn some obscure skill and now I want to get into coding and get better at making pixel art, but I know I'll never get impressively good at anything because I can't discipline myself enough.

The 9th was my birthday (technically it could also be the 10th, my birth certificate says it's the 10th but I was always raised celebrating it on the 9th and my parents insist it was the 9th, but who knows...) and I should really have nothing at all to complain about. I received gifts, birthday wishes and money. I will say that I was raised by my mother to believe that spend money = brain happy so I have a horrible habit of spending my money. I have horrible spending guilt and I feel like I deserve nothing. Like even though it's my birthday I really don't think I should be spoiling myself or buying myself anything but I do because it gives me that dopamine hit.

I'm worried I'm going to get kicked out and be homeless at the end of my semester next year, because I have such a hard time finding a job no matter how hard I try and it's so demoralizing.

I had the worst day in a while,2591287,UnnervedCompany,"Jul 10, 2024 at 1:30 AM","I had a complete mental breakdown cause everything came crashing down. It started with parental screaming due to a small spill started by a sibling. Then more parental screaming due to me saying I would like to a go to a Genshin store to buy merch. They screaming includes cussing, attack on my self, resentment for my being all because I mentioned something at passing. Then my sister threatened to not go outside with me even though we had plans and I wanted an excuse to leave the house for most of the day.

Then my sibling called, it started with light talk then he attacked my self as well calling me a cunt a failure just because he agreed with my parent even though I got accepted to a university better than him and I can go as low to as he failed to even talk his own life. He failed at suicide, maintain a relationship for a year, have a healthy partnership yet he still had the nerve to slander me due to me being passionate about a game even though I am more successful than him in everything including physical activity. I lashed back but I did not mention any of the above topics and defeats he had just said he should not call me a failure when I'm more successful than him academically. That caused my sister to swear to not go outside with me cause I was mean to my brother even though he started with calling me a failure and a cunt.

I went outside by my self participated in a protest for a cause I did not care about just to waste time. Then every trauma every wrong I experienced in my life by my sister and parents came crashing into my head. I remembered how I lost my only group of friends cause my parent would guilt me whenever I talked to her about any troubles I had with them and would tell me to just leave even though I needed guidance not to tell me to leave a friendship. Eventually I did leave that friend group and was too scared to start a single relationship for the rest of high school.

I remember how my mom prayed when I was still at 5 years old how she wants the entire family to go to hell so she never has to see us in the afterlife. I remembered how my dad would hit me even after I was 17 and strong enough to fight back yet I didn't. I remembered how one time my sister told my mom how my sister told my mom I had an online friend and then my mom belittled me for 2 hours with my sister checking my phone and belittling me as well just so my mom can like her more. I remembered how one time my mom was crying at a story that happened on the internet and I tried to cheer her up by mentioning how I was successful in school then I mentioned a Arlecchino and she started laughing but then called me a failure a worthless creature just because I mentioned Genshin even though it made her laugh like crazy and I was trying my best to cheer her mood. I remember how I fought a person bigger than me to protect my sister yet and got my eye beaten up like hell yet my entire family went against me due to me using a bottle to protect myself in the fight even though I was losing like hell and I just wanted to help my sister and did not even get into trouble much. More of these memories kept crashing on me until I went almost crazy and was desiring to steal a gun from a cops holster.

I vented this shit to my eldest and felt lost disgusted for venting to a person who can turn on me and ruin things more in a heartbeat. The funniest shit was when I got home my mom and sister gaslight me into hating myself because I was not in the mood to eat with them showing a constant repetition in their actions.

Best part is my other online friend did not check up on me even though I have him on delivered since yesterday yet I check up on him every day even when I have nothing useful or important to say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Given the community's sentiments, I get that this will be unpopular, but... well... Since I grew up, I always wanted to be a kid again. Growing up was always scary to me, and unsurprisingly, has caused a lot of anguish :( To do so, I figured I could have my own kids and re-experience childhood through them~ and well, since I'm Christian, I'd have to suffer through all the pain of wanting to be a girl instead of a guy, pretending and accepting the roles of something I'm not, and marry a woman to have kids with her and hopefully, get to have fun to play with them and her.
Yeah... It failed lots and sucked. Turns out that constantly pretending and being rejected despite it doesn't do much for your mental health :/
Now, I see all these people getting what I wanted soooo badly and can't help but feel extremely jealous. :/
And ofc, yes, I wouldn't be happy like that, but... Gender norms are still very much a real thing and sacrificing myself to it would just put me through the same amount of pain in a different way.
Now, since I'm a girl now, I just can't help but feel that I've dishonored my younger self by changing my gender and God (even tho I know He never condemned transgenderism anywhere in the Bible). Ofc, there's also the feelings of being an incel when people slam those people which just makes me feel worse. Like I had a gf but being a failed male who didn't even want to be one in the first place just makes me feel awful... :(
It just hurts and makes me so jealous. Why did Satan have to corrupt my gender? :(",,,,,,,,,,,,,

They said since I have mental illness they cannot help me. They referred me to a suicide hotline. Why oh why is physical pain and suffering considered more legitimate than emotional? Why is one considered not of sound judgment just because they suffer emotionally but not considered so if they suffer physically? Why is the desire to CTB considered a ""symptom"" of ""mental illness"", rather than a legitimate response to the suffering mental illness brings. Why is it not considered a symptom of physical illness? It is absurd that it is considered a symptom just like high blood pressure is a symptom. Not reflective of a perfectly sound and logical response to pain, but merely a ""symptom"". As if the mind just conjures up the desire to die out of nowhere. Due to a ""mental illness"" that cannot actually be tested for or proven. It is laughable. It is beyond me.

Why is emotional pain seen as lesser?,2590591,derpyderpins,"Jul 9, 2024 at 11:35 AM","Well, I wouldn't be mad at PPH about that necessarily. Their hands are likely tied.

But it is very frustrating how emotional pain is . . . let's say ""given less sympathy."" I've talked about it on here before, but there are a few things at play. First, people have heard a lot of wrong phrases/rules. (eg as @divinemistress36 said that all mental illness can be treated.)

A lot of it, though, comes down to both the ugly side of human nature and the cruel position this life puts us in. It is one of competition. We want to see ourselves as better, and when we're not better, we want our excuse for failure to be better. Society encourages this because capability and productivity are so highly valued.

If person A and B both get cut: person A gets a small cut that heals quickly and person B gets a huge gash requiring a dozen stitches, person A must yield that person B suffered a worse injury which could account for worse performance. But, if it's mental pain, person A gets a benefit from saying ""he's just weak,"" ""it's not that bad,"" ""he's exaggerating,"" ""it's all in his head rather than being a real problem,"" etc., because then it appears person A is simply better. This will help person A's self-esteem as well as other's opinions of him. It's cruel, but person A is incentivized to take this stance. Yet, the pain is real, and it does hold person B back some amount. Multiply this by a billion and you have a world where the person A's have collectively - unintentionally - made social norms that disadvantage the person B's.

I hope that makes some sense. It sucks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why is emotional pain seen as lesser?,2590607,Ihoujin,"Jul 9, 2024 at 11:56 AM","It depends how empathetic an other human being is and even this may not be sufficient.

Be it physical or emotional pain you can't measure it. You could have a scale to measure it and it wouldn't matter. You could have some kind of simulator which would instill in you a certain feeling but it's impossible, isn't it?

Even if someone has high blood pressure you can't know how the other human being is experiencing it and how he or she reacts to it. How he or she 'is experiencing life' (feelings, sensations, vision, patterns of thinking, the inner voice, habits, desires, fears, preferences, physiology, etc. you get it) other than projecting your 'experience of life' onto them.

Either the feeling of pain is very similar in your experience and mine or the same feeling is experienced like a palette and has different 'tastes' to it.

It is like tasting sugar. Can you explain me what is it like? How does sugar taste? Sweet... What does it mean? You have to try.

So majority of people won't emphasize with you on emotional pain - a suffering or being suicidal or mentally ill. They've never experienced it like in the case with sugar - they've never tasted it... It's understandable and I wouldn't be mad at them. We all know the physical pain unless you have some kind of condition you can't.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Why is emotional pain seen as lesser?,2590741,KuriGohan&Kamehameha,"Jul 9, 2024 at 2:11 PM","The average person is just very far removed from the extreme/severe cases, especially in modern media as mental illness has become a hot-button topic, the portrayals are very stereotypical and digestible. People fear what they don't understand and anyone with an ailment related to the mind are an easy target because the average person may know some pop psychology tidbits but they aren't really interested in keeping up with cutting edge developments in neuroscience, so a lot of common beliefs about mental illness are rooted in outdated or deliberate misconceptions.

Many people have no idea what it's like to be institutionalised, to be told you're untreatable or viewed as a guinea pig, or feel like a leper of society. It's very common for depressive disorders for example to be portrayed as something people can fix after trialing out one or two different SSRIs, because that's a very hopeful narrative, and is true for a certain number of people. Yet, it is projected onto everyone. No one wants to believe that the treatment resistant case could happen to anyone through no fault of their own.

I was taught in my degree that SSRIs are not very effective but have a strong placebo effect due to the power of belief. And yet they are seen as the gold standard treatment for pretty much anything relating to mood disorders. Progress is very slow.

While there I was the victim of multiple crimes by the ""university"" including being illegally forced out. While in college I was part of the oncology research group, president the last year, co-authored and presented at conference original work... I wanted and was working to become an oncologist. To take away people's pain. I Basically worked my ass off in life. I had a job in college while studying. Worked after college before medical school (medical scribe predominately in oncology). I also worked my ass off in medical school (no job but we had summer courses as part of the curriculum and it wasn't legal for me to have a job in Poland).... My job in the states I worked 20-25 hours per week but was essentially on call or working every day except for 3 days per month. Meaning I constantly worked and it was room/board. I say all of this to say this... My parents are fairly well off. They could help if they wanted. Instead them and my entire family (I really don't have friends as I was always studying) didn't help or really even care what happened.

As in- everything would be ok if I won the lottery, if I didn't have debilitating health issues, if I had been born into this or that body, this or that life, if the world was a nicer place.

It's like- sure- if we lived in sandbox mode. If everything was possible- then maybe people would feel less inclined to want out. (They may still eventually though.) It's the simple fact that change can be difficult- sometimes near impossible to effect in life- that I imagine most of us are here. Change requires effort most of the time and we can still fail in obtaining our goals. I just think this kind of thinking ignores all that. It's like- just 'get' a better life for yourself. Really? It's that easy? There's a shop I can exchange this life for a better one is there?!!

The other one is- 'Suicidal people don't really want to die. They simply want the pain to stop.' Well- duh! Of course people want the pain to stop but again- it's not as simple as an off switch! I reckon people turn to suicide when most other things have already failed. I doubt suicide is the first thing everyone leaps to when things start to unravel in life.

I just think it's about realism. Can I realistically get the kind of life I want given current world circumstances? If the answer is 'maybe' but it will require vast amounts of effort. (Seems likely.) Then, it's a matter of- do I have the strength and staying power for all that?

Again though- it's a matter of perspective. What one person might feel content with 'settling' for may not be enough for someone else. That again will vary from person to person but really- why should anyone be forced to accept a life they personally find intolerable?

It's like I feel there are these unwritten laws in society: You have to at least try to create a life you find tolerable- you musn't give up. If that doesn't work, then you'll have to learn to settle because- that's what so many other people are doing. People worse off than you- be grateful you're not them at least. You can't kill yourself. I feel like the majority of the population just accepts that as their default mode.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

LF a compassionate friend til my end </3 (I have OCD but you don't have to),2591131,idontgiveadvicehere,"Jul 9, 2024 at 9:29 PM","Hey guys. 23F, Eastern Time. I'm strongly considering CTB (because moderate/severe lifelong OCD). I've been extremely suicidal off and on since 2021. I can't talk to people irl about this for fear of them stopping me. I want to be neither stopped nor encouraged. I just want a shoulder to cry on about this, and talk about the morality/philosophy of my suicide. Someone who is kind and compassionate. :( (whether Discord or on here) ... I feel so sad that this is how it's going to end. Especially for my dog, she won't understand. I'm usually an open person, I'm dying to come clean with the bf and I know he'd move heaven and earth for me, but I can't tell him. I'm still going to work and honestly I'm scared driving because I've stopped cold turkey probably 6or7+ meds. I'm barely taking my meds or eating anymore, I'm considering cancelling my therapy, and I'm going to be making arrangements for CTB soon. I really feel bad about life ending this way. I believe life is sacred and I feel like I'm throwing in the towel. I feel bad for a lot of religious reasons, and I have a lot of mixed feelings. But I know sooner or later I'm going to have another severe panic attack and be deeply traumatized again. I'd rather die first. I absolutely 100% cannot go through that pain again. Even though sometimes I feel good about life, I feel with every step back I get closer and closer to doing it. I've already had two attempts and I know what I'm doing (mostly). It's just a matter of time at this point... I just want an existence of peace and serenity, not this life that's been full of anxiety and panic since the beginning.

Unfortunately, I am NOT looking for someone who is planning on or strongly considering committing suicide in the near future. Ironically, as much as I want to do it, when someone I know wants to do it, all I want to do is help them get better so they don't do it. I can't share what I know, either. I'm sorry... you've been warned. (Plus I just don't have the bandwidth to be there for someone in the same boat as me, mine is already sinking...)

psych ward,2589991,lacrimosa,"Jul 8, 2024 at 7:48 PM","I've had 4 different stays and I spent most of them sleeping as other people fuel my psychosis, unfortunately. If there was a quiet, semi lit room with no people except maybe for psychiatrists and nurses that come and go, I would choose to stay there on some days (when my psychosis gets real bad) but that's like asking to find a needle in a haystack. Especially because of the current mental health crisis and the lack of psyche ward beds in my country's hospitals.

I can't get better with all the people around and they stick you in a room with roommates whom are also out to lunch so you have the added pleasure of worrying what they're going to do when you sleep. I slept mostly during the day, when there were a lot of staff around.

Private hospitals with psychiatrists are about $18,000 dollars a month where I live...

But we know the mental health care systems (in most countries) are broken yet we refuse to do anything about it even though 1 in 6 people are statistically diagnosed as mentally ill or will be in their life time. It's a sick joke how we just let the shit slide and make fun of those whom are homeless due to mental illness but we're a hair trigger away from being in the same situation. Nobody wants to help them and nobody wants to fix the mental health crisis and it will continue to get worse.

What I believe, is that society's attitude towards mental health is equal to this quote by Dostoyevsky:

""I am a sick man... I am a spiteful man. I am an unpleasant man. I think my liver is diseased. However, I don't know beans about my disease, and I am not sure what is bothering me. I don't treat it and never have, though I respect medicine and doctors. Besides, I am extremely superstitious, let's say sufficiently so to respect medicine. (I am educated enough not to be superstitious, but I am.) No, I refuse to treat it out of spite. You probably will not understand that. Well, but I understand it. Of course I can't explain to you just whom I am annoying in this case by my spite. I am perfectly well aware that I cannot ""get even"" with the doctors by not consulting them. I know better than anyone that I thereby injure only myself and no one else. But still, if I don't treat it, its is out of spite. My liver is bad, well then-- let it get even worse!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,
psych ward,2589992,AmericanMary,"Jul 8, 2024 at 7:50 PM","I stayed in a psych ward for a while several years ago. My only take away: I got really good at uno.

They really prescribed nothing but trazodone and Benadryl. I was on the floor for low risk adults, so it was pretty chill. We just didn't really ask each other what put us in this situation and it fine. The girl I roomed with was there for some bad stuff.

The group therapy attempts were so dumb.

The place was sketchy af. Not gonna doxx myself, so I'll leave it at this: multiple not CTB bodies have been found there. Honestly it was similar to a prison. Locked in our rooms at night. Supervised showers. Everything was padded and nailed to the floor. I didn't go outside once for weeks. No phones or nicotine. They stopped everyone's meds, everyone was going through withdrawal. Rooms locked during the day. Like 30 of us just coloring, playing uno, and watching children's shows.

It was however, a break from real life. They told you how and when to do everything. They cooked and cleaned. It was relaxing. But it didn't help.

I live in America. I had health insurance. And this shit still cost thousands and thousands of dollars.

My takeaway: I was not there for CTB attempt. I was there for other reasons. I did not feel different or feel like it helped in the long run. But it did give me a break. It helped me calm down.

In the psych ward I was tormented by both malicious patients, some of whom would use their neurodivergent diagnoses to evade punishment by pretending to be unaware of their actions, as well as by members of staff who would abuse their position of authority over me. Ironically enough, I ended up leaving the psych ward more broken and traumatised than I was when I had initially arrived 15 months prior. I still get flashbacks to incidents on the psych ward despite it being nearly seven years since I was discharged.

I just need to know; I just need to be told that I am the mistake, the regret of the architect of this silent world. Just tell me I'm destined for despair. JUST TELL ME.

If there is a god, they never said they loved me, but that's not so much the problem. Could they not say they hate me? From the empty life I've lived so long that even I have become an empty shell of meaningless actions and isolation, how can I not say this means I'm hated. The world I've encountered, full of love and opportunity that I squandered because my eyes were blinded by the trauma of the life I've had, this world now only has pain for me. Was there a divinity in that small window when the world opened up for me? That tiny moment in time when I could have shed my despair, maybe become someone worthy of love, was there a divinity then? Some voice calling out, now silent.

How can I live like this :( ? How can I die like this?! How can I die in the gutter drowning in my tears and misery and not say this world set me up to fail? So many questions and yet no one can answer. No one can see beyond the letters, the sentence, the grammar, the speech... the blank stare; no one can speak to my soul.

The billions of lives that have lived and loved and suffered until now, each one no different from me. Many with a fate so much worse than mine. Why can't I look at that and find peace in my end. But even now, on the edge of death life calls to me. WHAT'S WORSE? Will they not say I could have chosen to see the good? Will they not tell me I forged my own despair, that it was my fault? Will they not say ""I don't know why he did it""? They, who are loved by this life I suppose, or perhaps who understand it enough to be loved by it.

I just want to know what I am.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,2575268,dumed1,"Jun 26, 2024 at 7:58 AM","I've been suicidal before, but never registered an account here until now. About a year ago, I came out of a major depression and decided to get lasik. Maybe because I was a bit manic after having overcome depression, I didn't do as much research as I'd normally do about such a serious procedure, and I think I would have never gotten it if I had fully read and understood the risks. But I did get it, and it was great for awhile, but then my eyes suddenly became so dry that I have to constantly put in eye drops (many times per hour) and can't go outside almost at all, or my eyes will dry out. If do go outside or neglect the eyedrops, my eyes will be in pain for days and my vision will permanently deteriorate in weird ways. Worst of all, it doesn't seem like this condition is treatable, or that any doctor even knows what's wrong exactly - all they know is that lasik severed my corneal nerves, and thus my tear glands don't produce tears anymore, or at least tears that are good quality.

I can't do most of the things that make life worth living, except hang out with my girlfriend, who is a saint and hasn't left me (yet). But she wants to go out, and I can't do that. I see myself becoming a bitter, complaining person who is always in pain and can't do basic things. I see myself losing all my friends and my girlfriend. I can see myself losing my job and then my healthcare.

I fear becoming blind and not being able to commit suicide beforehand. I really don't want to be alive if I'm blind. I am 37, I don't know how to be a blind person, and I will not be able to learn how to navigate the world or find community. Who would take care of me? I have no real family. I also really like visual information, and my brain would be moving way too fast for auditory information to keep me engaged. I'd probably end up wishing for death constantly, even more than I already do due to my eye problems. And I've had suicidal thoughts even when my body was healthy!

So, I've decided to start planning to CTB in parallel to getting treatment that will hopefully help me (but is a long shot, as there is no real treatment for this, only management). That way, if my vision deteriorates, I will be able to end my life before I become a blind man with no one around to help him.

In the past, I wanted to use the nitrogen exit bag method, since it seemed to be the most peaceful. But I'm not sure that this is good for my current situation, as a nitrogen tank is too big to hide from others and might be hard to acquire and set up if I'm near-blind (the other stuff, like the exit bag and the regulator/tube is small enough to be kept hidden). Another method I looked at is SN, which can be kept hidden, but it's much less appealing to me, especially since I have to take an anti-emetic and might still puke. Seems not very peaceful, AND the ingredients seem hard to source. I just wish I could buy a firearm, but I live in one of the few jurisdictions in the US where purchasing any gun is illegal without special permission.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,2575336,dumed1,"Jun 26, 2024 at 9:18 AM","It really sucks because I was actually doing much better with regards to my depression. I had gotten a girlfriend for the first time in 5 years, things were going great with her, and I had a large group of friends that I was hanging out with and becoming closer to. I was even considering becoming a parent. For the first time in my life, life was really great. And then this health issue completely destroyed everything. I just wish I could go back in time and never get lasik. It's such a bad idea, even if this hadn't happened to me. It's a really destructive surgical procedure that's completely unnecessary. I was just so insecure about my glasses... and I really wanted to have perfect vision again. Such a waste of a wonderful life.

For those of you who primarily have mental issues, please know that these things can be fixed with medication, lifestyle changes, etc. I too once thought that I would be lonely forever and wouldn't be able to survive without company. And yet, after I got over my last depressive episode, I was able to build a very good life up until 1 month ago. But this is just too much. I can't just sit around in pain watching my vision deteriorate.

My only concern is for my girlfriend. She would be really sad if I killed myself. But, she's already really sad about what's happening to me, can't sleep, is constantly worried, etc. I feel like such a burden to her, and she would be long-term happier if I was gone, I think.
I too thought I would never get a girlfriend, because I am pale and bald and ugly. That's one of the reasons I was so set on getting lasik. But actually my girlfriend had met me before I got lasik and thought I was cute with glasses - I just didn't have the courage to approach her, because my self-esteem was too low.

Don't make the same mistake I made! Appreciate what you have (your health, even if it's not perfect, if you don't have to constantly worry about it that's better off than me), put yourself out there, make friends, make relationships. I know it's not that easy, and it wasn't easy for me. But it's possible. And I believe you can do it.",2575330,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2576042,sanctions,"Jun 26, 2024 at 10:31 PM","Hey, fellow dry-eye sufferer here. I had PRK surgery 16 years ago and things were good for about a year. Then my vision started getting worse and I got chronic dry eye disorder. First my eye dr put me on refresh eye drops, which definitely help and I use it daily as needed. I also started eating tuna/salmon daily which helped. The first prescription he put me on was restasis, which did not help. Then he put me on Lotemax, which did help. It was some 4x a day regimen for a week, then 3x a day for a week, 2x for a week, 1x for a week. This helped tremendously. However, Lotemax is supposed to be used in short-term bursts like he prescribed, not on an ongoing basis. However, it is safe for ongoing use and my eye doctor made an exception for me. I've had to experiment with different schedules for taking the drug, and I've incorporated another prescription drug into the mix, xiidra, but my eyes are A LOT better and don't affect me much anymore. Maybe you'll have to experiment around, but my own routine is this:

day 1: lotemax (one drop in each eye) and refresh drops as needed
day 2: refresh drops as needed
day 3: xiidra (one drop in each eye) and refresh drops as needed
day 4: refresh drops as needed
day 5: xiidra (one drop in each eye) and refresh drops as needed
day 6: refresh drops as needed

then back to day 1.

btw I have to throw each lotemax bottle away after 7 uses because after that the effectiveness drastically deteriorates. My doctor has no idea why that happens, but it does.

What eyedrops and/or medications have you tried?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2576546,dumed1,"Jun 27, 2024 at 9:58 AM","I can't use refresh drops, they don't stay for long enough. I think my dry eye is very severe - my tears evaporate instantly, and I don't have much of them to begin with.

I use optase dry eye intense eye drops, which I have to use several times an hour, every hour. I've tried a bunch of other drops (refresh, systane complete, refresh relieva, retaine mgd, hylo gel, meibo). Meibo works decently well but it makes my vision really blurry, and I need another drop to go underneath meibo. Meibo replaces the oily layer of the tear film that I don't have anymore, and the other drop replaces the aqueous layer which I also don't really have anymore.

I'm on eysuvis, which is like a much more expensive lotemax. It helps with the symptoms, but my eyes are still really dry. And I can't use it for much longer. At that point, I'm pretty sure pain will return.

I'm using cequa eye drops, which make my eye burn, but it doesn't look like they actually DO anything to increase my tear production or the quality of my tears. I'm taking omega3 supplements, but that's not doing anything. I'm trying manuka honey, which stings so much it makes my eyes water, but it's low quality tears that evaporate fast. So, I don't know if it's worth it. But it seems to have anti-inflammatory properties, so maybe it will help?

It seems like whenever I find something that works, even if it's ridiculous like wearing goggles to go outside, my condition gets worse and that no longer works well enough. Now I need fully-sealed goggles in order to go outside, which means they fog up almost instantly and are really unpleasant to wear. Since the outdoors is my happy place, the place that I used to go to escape feelings of depression and suicide, I don't know how much longer I can tolerate my condition. Maybe if I was mentally healthy before this happened, I'd be able to live on with a severely reduced quality of life, and stay positive. But this is just too much, I think.

Still, even with all these symptoms, RIGHT NOW I don't want to die. Maybe it's my girlfriend's support. Maybe it's my friends' support. Maybe it's that I'm curious about what the future will bring (societally and for my friends and family, even if I'm just an observer). Maybe it's because I finally figured out a way to sleep through the night. But I suspect this will wear on me, especially since it's hard for me to go outside and get exercise. I guess if I died right now I wouldn't be too disappointed, but I'm not at a point where I definitely want to die.

I'll be making exit bags later today because it makes me feel better knowing there's a way out from dealing with this pain.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dry eye sounds so innocuous until you have a severe case of it. Have you tried punctal plugs or autologous serum eyedrops? These things didn't help me much but they help some. There's a doctor in Boston named Dr. Hamrah who deals with people who have been damaged by lasik. He can look at your corneal nerves with a special microscope to see whats going on, and prescribe a protocol of eyedrops to encourage the nerves to grow back. I don't know if you're anywhere close to there.

If you just got lasik, the dry eye situation may get better over time. Sometimes it takes the nerves a long ass time to heal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,2580044,dumed1,"Jun 30, 2024 at 8:07 AM","I currently take it twice a day. Even with the eysuvis, I have to put in drops every 30 minutes or so to avoid pain. My eyes don't seem to produce much of their own tears, but I am going to a doctor soon who will confirm or deny this. I got some moisture chamber glasses that I can use to go outside, but they fog up (that's the point of them), and I still have to put in drops all the time, maybe even more frequently than every 30 minutes. My vision keeps getting worse, I'll need glasses again, but I'd need a new prescription every week. This doesn't feel like a life worth living, to me.

Looking at a computer is tough, looking at my phone is tough. Without anything to distract me, I am alone with my thoughts, and my thoughts have always been terrible. I've been suicidal before even when my life was objectively great, and now it's objectively horrible.

I want to commit suicide. But then when I envision putting the exit bag or gas mask over my head, turning on the nitrogen tank, and falling asleep forever... I feel disgusted, and I want to live. But my life is also excruciating and boring and hard and painful and full of guilt, so I want to die. And on and on it goes...

I talked with my girlfriend about thoughts of suicide and now SHE can't sleep and is very worried. She told me she would kill herself if I killed myself, or that she would be traumatized for years. This is horrible, she might be right. I feel like a huge burden to her and that she would be much better off if I died, but maybe my suicide would make her life even worse than it is now. I feel stuck between a rock and a hard place.

Even with all of this, there are some brief moments in life that are still enjoyable, like cuddling with the girlfriend, cooking a meal together, watching a movie (although this is becoming harder as my vision is getting worse). But I can feel the depression moving in, taking away joy from everything. And when it's fully taken over my mind, I don't know if I can continue living. I just don't think I'm resilient enough to handle something like this. I always thought that I would die from suicide once I developed a serious medical condition that made life much harder, I just didn't think it would happen in my late 30s.",2578506,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2581787,YourEarthRoommate,"Jul 1, 2024 at 6:54 PM","I can't even imagine how devastating this has been for you. Honestly, my heart hurts reading everything that you've written here. I have struggled both with suicidal ideation and debilitating dry eyes, though not related to one another. I've also witnessed what suicide does to those you leave behind, and been incapacitated from an injury that eliminated my ability to walk. I would love to give you some sincere, yet candid perspective / advice with that in mind. I know this is long, but I have a lot to say.

First, and I know this is the last thing you want to hear right now, but it's 100% true and critical to recognize; you are lucky and fortunate more than you realize. I can tell from that last post alone. The human brain can be cruel by pointing your attention to everything that's gone wrong and how unfair it is. This issue significantly affects every aspect of your life, so how could you not think about it 24/7? I understand what it feels like to have everything impacted by a disability you didn't deserve, and it's grueling. I have serious compassion for you. That said, I would give my left fucking arm for a partner who was so compassionate, supportive, loving, and committed to stick by my side like that. Holy shit dude. She cares so so so much for you. There are people who live their whole lives without having anyone feel that way for them, and I'm jealous of you for finding her. Even though it's sour to hear someone tell you to be grateful... dude. Be grateful for her and tell her you love her. Even though it's difficult, intentionally focusing on the parts of life that are good takes power away from things that are bad. The inverse of that is also true.

Another traumatic thing we do to ourselves when facing disability is to compare our loftiest expectations and dreams of what life could have looked like, with the most pessimistic and hopeless guess at what life will look like ""now."" For example, when I lost the ability to walk, I could NOT STOP THINKING about how I wasn't going to be able to workout anymore, play racquetball, go on walks, be an attractive partner, walk my daughter down the aisle, etc etc etc. I had so many plans that were ""taken"" from me, and it was crushing. As months went by though, I started to realize that my life wasn't necessarily ruined, it was just altered. While those consequences were real, I had different opportunities present themselves that were beneficial. For example, I joined a wheelchair basketball league and made the best friends of my life there. I would have never have met those people had this not happened, and although I'm not grateful to be in a wheelchair, I'm grateful to have them. In your situation, this may look something like artistic expression. I know you're not blind, but when you lose your vision, your brain adapts and senses other than sight are enhanced. You could leverage that and dive into writing music, mastering an instrument, writing a book or poetry, making pottery by feel, designing custom and designer perfumes, etc. You're truly only as limited as you perceive yourself to be. I really want you to believe that.

Also realize that making an effort like that would encourage and impress your girlfriend more than you know. She sees how difficult this is for you, and would be inspired and proud beyond words to see you make that effort. Rather than being a burden on her, you're in a position to show her what a man does in the face of undeserved adversity: persist, endure, achieve, and eventually, thrive. Should you leave us, her life would be irreparably scarred. She would be plagued with doubts of ""Was I not supportive enough?"" ""Why didn't I get him help?"" ""Did I say something that pushed him over the edge?"" ""Was I not enough for him to live for?"" and on and on and on. I've seen it, and it's many years of self-blame and guilt at a minimum. If it were up to me, you would make the effort to ""grow through the concrete,"" be an inspiration for her, and find pride in the person looking back from the mirror.

Finally, I want to address your eyes. I had a few years where my eyes were so dry that my eyelids would stick to my eyeballs when looking around. Thankfully it resolved with time, which should be a hopeful anecdote. I learned a lot about treatment options in that time.

1. Those glasses are life savers, but you need to use an anti-fog coating on them. Get some FogAway. I'm not sure which glasses you have now, but Ziena makes the best ones. They cost a bit, but they're worth their weight in gold. Super comfortable, inconspicuous, and they seal really well.

2. You should also be using cyclosporine eye drops morning and night. You're using cequa which is cyclosporine, but its more expensive and causes the burning you mentioned due to the carrier fluid. It claims to be faster acting than generic cyclosporine, though that's debatable and inconsequential for long term treatment. You can order generic cyclosporine drops (aka Restasis) online from sources overseas for pennies on the dollar (alldaychemist). Note that it can take up to 3 months for cyclosporine to be fully effective, but it's absolutely worth the commitment.

3. It's my uneducated opinion that you should keep using the eyesuvis or even up it to lotemax (higher concentration), at least until other treatments start working maximally. It reduces inflammation, but through a different mechanism of action than cyclosporine, so their effects are additive. I would recommend letting your doctor know where you're at mentally and getting another prescription. You could also check the source I mentioned. The consequences of continued use should be monitored by a doctor, but generally aren't acute. You're mainly looking at increased intraocular pressures and potential cataract formation, but those take time to occur (if they do), and can be prevented if your doc is monitoring you.

4. Get punctal plugs, top and bottom. The puncti drain your tears down though your nasal passages. You can have a doctor put a tiny plastic plug in them so your tears last longer on your eyeball; this made a huge difference for me. You can feel them on the surface of your eye for a couple days, but your brain soon ignores the sensation.

5. You should also try scleral lenses. They are contacts that sit on the sclera (white part) of your eye rather than the cornea. They have a small liquid reservoir between the lens and cornea which keeps the eye hydrated. They don't work for everyone and I haven't tried them myself, but many swear by them.

6. Use a humidifier or two at home and monitor the indoor humidity. This will let you to function more normally which is huge for morale. Even if you still have to use drops, it will be less often. I've even used one in my car before and it helps tremendously. Whole-home steam humidifiers are best, but you can go with an ultrasonic one with distilled water (important) to start. Also consider a high quality HEPA air purifier. They suck an astonishing amount of crud out of even the cleanest homes.

7. Take a high quality omega-3 supplement and eat salmon often. Tere's research that proves it's efficacy at thickening the lipid layer of your tears.

8. Drink plenty of water. I've noticed that my eyes get much more dry when I'm not hydrating intentionally.

9. Get a microwavable heating pad like this https://a.co/d/0faAL0sZ. It's not a cure, but the heat encourages tear production and reduces soreness. It's a luxurious experience and something to look forward to as a break from the discomfort.

10. Be certain you are using preservative free eye drops rather than a bottle (the ones in little vials of 5 stick together). Optase dry eyes intense might be ok, but I would recommend you try Refresh Optive Advanced (https://a.co/d/03u4K9r9). They have 5 times the glycerine, 0.5% CMC, and polysorbate. Those last 2 ingredients aren't in yours and they are beneficial. CMC makes the drops last much longer due to it's viscosity. Polysorbate is a surfactant and emulsifier that helps the liquid spread evenly and stabilizes the lipid layer to reduce evaporation. The viscosity might not be as immediately refreshing as what you're using now, but they are significantly longer lasting. You could even use both.

11. Ask your doctor about autologous eye drops. They are eye drops made from your own blood, which sounds weird, but they work. The growth factors, proteins, vitamins, and lipids in them improve your eyes ability to heal, reduce inflammation and irritation, and provide superior lubrication to anything else you could buy.

I believe in the right to chose. If CTB is a conclusion someone comes to after careful consideration, they should feel empowered to make that choice. From my perspective though, that'd be a flat out mistake for you. You have hope for a beautiful future life with your girl, you've got dozens of avenues of personal expression and entertainment to explore, and there's many efficous treatment options you haven't tried that have worked for me personally, not to mention the possibility your body heals on its own. The difficulty you're going through now will sharpen your character, force you to grow, and give you something to be proud of yourself for! Don't stick around for your girlfriend, do it for yourself and the opportunities you still have.

I really wish you the best man. I took the time to write all this out because I deeply empathize with you. I know what disability feels like, and I know it's absolute hell, but I ALSO know there's countless beautiful, joyful, and rewarding days in your future that you would be foolish to miss out on. It's just difficult to see them right now.

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help. I'm here for you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But it's very hard for her to take care of me, and I don't want her life to end just because she's dating me. It's not a very long relationship, it just moved very fast.
Yes, it's true. I am grieving what my life could have been without getting lasik, compared to what it is now, and also the worst case scenario of losing my vision completely (it's declining rapidly). The problem with all the things you mentioned is that I don't enjoy any of them. Playing music is especially traumatic for me due to childhood abuse around music. I think the core problem is that I was already close to suicide even when everything was fine, and this disability is pushing me over the edge.

Making art is good and all, but I am not a very creative person. I did consider learning to draw, and that is still something that I could do.
Yea this would be the ideal. Unfortunately, as someone who had a lot of difficulty doing normal things in life before this, I am not sure that I would be able to step up. Even simply surviving is using up all my energy. Also, it's not clear that this adversity is undeserved - I shouldn't have gotten lasik, even if this dry eye situation hadn't happened, I would have still regretted my decision as my vision was not actually as stable as I hoped, I kinda tricked myself into believing that it was.
Yes I have the Ziena Kai. They are fine and they allow me to go outside and do things, as long as I put in eyedrops every 30 minutes or so. I have anti-fog wipes, which don't really seem to be doing much. I'll try fogaway.
I am using cequa because it's faster-acting. It's fine that it's expensive, I can easily afford it (another reason why my life was so awesome before all this started).
Yes I am continuing to use eyesuvis. I guess it's better to use that than to continue having everything be inflamed.
Bad idea when there's inflammation in my tears (which there is right now). It will trap the inflammatory cytokines on my eye and worsen everything.
Yes, it's on the list of things to try. But maybe a last resort. My eyesight is fluctuating / declining so quickly right now that I'm not sure what kind of scleral lense I should even get. It's also tricky to get scleral lenses if TBUT=0 and there's few natural tears in the eye. The scleral lens doesn't cover the entire eye, so the corners of my eye would still get very dry.
Yes this is all good advice, thank you. I do have a humidifier for the winter, but I am running the air conditioner right now so it doesn't really make sense.... Humidity is at 50% though, not too low.
Doing all of these, thank you. Will try the refresh optive advanced drops.
I'm getting these next week sometime.
Right now, I think the main problem is my attitude / major depression/anxiety being triggered as a result of my eyes. When I get depression, I end up contemplating suicide a lot, even when things are totally fine in my life. And I tell myself it's going to be ok, you're fine, everything is fine. But I can't really tell myself that right now. And I can't use a lot of the coping strategies I used to use, because they either involved looking at screens, going outside, or socializing, all of which are difficult for me right now.

And a lot of it is me blaming myself for getting lasik. I clearly had dry eyes beforehand, because I couldn't wear contacts for the entire day. I didn't think I had dry eyes because I never had to put in eye drops. But I should have done more research, and realized that my eyes were dry, and that getting lasik was especially risky for me. I always do a lot of research before doing anything. Except for this. What was I even thinking?

And also my eyes are getting a lot worse rapidly. I used to be able to put in eyedrops every 30 minutes, which was terrible, but... now they dry out almost immediately. If I put in meibo too, it can last 15 minutes maybe. But that's putting in 2 drops in every eye, every 15 minutes, the entire time I'm awake. If I use moisture seal glasses, that can be extended a bit, but they fog up.",2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,2581787,

You probably already know all this, although perhaps it's hard to look stuff up.

You probably live in Washington DC since you can't easily buy a gun which means you probably already went to Wilmer which means probably the other places won't provide that much different care, although it could be worth it to check out Bascom Palmer. I would also be a bit more careful on here with posting information that makes it clear where you are because they could figure out who you are, the pro-lifers who want everyone alive even if they are in agonizing pain for religious reasons, and they do have some legal options to mess with people. If I could figure it out, they could too.

Your situation is terrible. I'm so sorry, and I'm so sorry they don't make it easier for people who want to end things.

I think you need to decide whether you are willing to live with the pain or without eyesight in order to be with your girlfriend. This sounds awful, but if they take your eyes out would the pain subside? Could you exist as a blind person and be happy or would that be too much to bare?

I would try to keep going to all the top Eye doctors and try a few things, although it may end up being pointless. If you live in Washington DC, wouldn't you be able to just move to a different location if you can lawfully do so and then keep whatever you get somewhere else (away from your girlfriend who could be impacted) and that way if things get worse you would have it? Or just pay the suicide clinic in advance? I understand your fears on losing eyesight completely and then being unable to find a good way to end things and being in pain and possibly being dependent on others and unable to die. Being trapped like that is a horrible situation. It sounds like you don't want to ctb right now, you want to live if there's any way to get better, but you want the option available.

You indicated your financial situation is alright. Can you go down the list of top eye hospitals and see at least a few?

Have you drawn up a will so that your girlfriend will have something if things get worse? Would that help her out? Have you talked to the clinics in Switzerland?

I'm so sorry. They need to warn people more about Lasik and the things that can happen with when it goes wrong.

You seem like a nice person and I hope there's some doctor out there who is willing to try something new that could work. If the problem is inflammation, I don't know why they can't inject or apply strong anti-inflammatories to the area.

I don't want to die, but I also don't want to live like this. If it gets significantly worse, I will probably want to die.

So my recommendation would be salmon, egg yolks, cod liver, and any other liver like chicken liver. Don't eat the liver daily as it can cause vitamin A toxicity. Beta-carotine is not a real substitute of actual vitamin A as some people are very bad converters (from betacarotine to vitamin A).
Also, I notice that heat for me helps with tear production and tear quality so I shower hot water on my closed eyes and entire face daily. If this dry you out even more, then find other heat source.
Avoid all seed oils and margarine. If in a restaurant, ask them to use olive oil, butter or lard, if they have them, not seed (vegetable) oil. Some restaurants only have seed oils as they are tbe cheapest but they cause inflammation and correlated with various eye iaaues.

I was not aware that you can go blind from dry eyes. I am going blind due to the death of the optic nerve (glaucoma), which is permanent, but I also went blind in my life due to cornea failure which was sold with a cornea transplant.
I had about 15 eye surgeries so far. I am permanently on steroid drops due to the transplant.
I have an artificial iris, various shunts, iris missing, pupils unresponsive, lots of stuff going on but no dry eyes. But I did notice that if I don't do the heat treatment each day, I start to get dryer eyes. I do a very hot bath each day and then hot water on my closed eyes for a few minutes.
As far as inflammation, the ketogenic diet does bring down inflammation systematically in the whole body, I think it works stronger than some anti-inflammatory drugs, it will even stop joint pain and other inflammatory processes.
I definitely don't think that taking omega supplements are as effective as actually eating that salmon, egg yolks, cod liver, etc.
And you have to try to completely eliminate seed oils even if this means not eating out in restaurants",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've gone through many depressions and suicidal ideations, and have come close to purchasing the gear before, just due to mental issues / loneliness.

I felt like a failure, I was living with my abusive parents, jobless, friendless, etc. But because I didn't commit suicide, I was able to get a high paying job, become rich even, travel the world, make a bunch of friends, get a girlfriend, get an amazing apartment, etc. So for mental issues alone, I don't recommend suicide, as these tend to resolve with time, therapy, treatment, and lifestyle changes. I even tried every anti depressant treatment and it didn't work, but my depression still got better anyway, with time and lifestyle changes. So it gets better, I know that.

But dry eye... Dry eye gets worse. It's unlikely with my condition that I'll be able to live a normal life again.
You usually can't, but with the severity of my dry eye, it's very easy for the eye to completely dry out and then tear the cornea while blinking or moving the eye.
I am so sorry to hear this. Going blind is terrifying and eye problems in general cause depression more than other health issues (I've had other weird health issues and my eye problems feel much worse).
It's tough for me to take care of myself right now, so I've been eating out more than usual. Probably not good for me. But I have been trying to eat more salmon. I'll try to do a ketogenic diet. I suspect it won't do much but who knows.",2586230,2586523,2586523,2586523,,,,,,,,,

,2586752,needthebus,"Jul 5, 2024 at 10:47 PM","My friend had complications from Lasik and has very dry eyes that are painful. Who is the best doctor on the planet for this problem?

Answer

For severe dry eye complications following LASIK surgery, it's crucial to consult a specialist with extensive experience in managing post-LASIK complications. While it's difficult to definitively name a single ""best doctor on the planet"" for this issue, there are several highly regarded experts in the field of corneal and external eye diseases who specialize in treating complex dry eye cases, including those resulting from LASIK complications. Some top specialists in this area include:

Dr. Stephen Pflugfelder at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas. He is renowned for his research and clinical work on dry eye disease and ocular surface disorders
Dr. Edward Holland at the Cincinnati Eye Institute. He is a corneal specialist with expertise in complex anterior segment surgery and ocular surface diseases
Dr. Christopher Rapuano at Wills Eye Hospital in Philadelphia. He is known for his work on corneal diseases and refractive surgery complications

These specialists have extensive experience treating severe dry eye cases and are often sought out for complex post-LASIK complications. However, it's important to note that there are many skilled ophthalmologists and optometrists who specialize in dry eye treatment and post-LASIK care. For your friend's specific case, consider the following steps:

Seek a comprehensive evaluation from a corneal specialist or dry eye expert. They can assess the severity of the condition and recommend appropriate treatments

Explore advanced treatment options. These may include autologous blood serum drops, special contact lenses, or procedures to unblock oil glands
Consider combination therapies. Severe cases often require a multi-faceted approach, potentially including prescription medications, in-office procedures, and lifestyle modifications. Be patient with the treatment process. Resolving severe dry eye can take time, and the treatment plan may need adjustments along the way

If local treatments are not providing relief, consider seeking a second opinion or referral to a major eye center specializing in complex cases.

Remember, the ""best"" doctor for your friend will be one who not only has expertise in treating post-LASIK dry eye but also takes a personalized approach to their specific case. It may be beneficial to start with a highly regarded specialist in your local area or region, as ongoing care and follow-up will be important in managing this condition.

Yeah those hobbies aren't for everyone. You would definitely benefit from channeling yourself into something though. I learned how to play the drums and it's one of the best decisions I've made. I could watch myself get better too, which really built my self esteem.

Life can be cruel and I'm sorry you're struggling like this. When ""doing normal things"" is difficult, you're in a really rough spot. I know next to nothing about your real-life self, but from the little I've read here, I can picture you stepping up. In your own words: ""Because I didn't commit suicide, I was able to get a high paying job, become rich even, travel the world, make a bunch of friends, get a girlfriend, get an amazing apartment, etc."" You can't get much better evidence of capability than that. You're situations changed, but you're still that dude.

On your undeserved adversity point, it's bullshit and I address it later.

Hell, if I were you I'd order the top 10 on Amazon and keep trying until one worked. Don't have much to loose there.

I see. Did your doctor tell you that or did you find a source making that connection? From what I was able to find, it looks like the claim ""punctal plugs trap cytokines, thereby worsening symptoms"" is a hypothesis but not proven.

The Singapore Eye Research Institute actually conducted a study on this and concluded:
""Punctal plug occlusion provided symptomatic relief and reduced fluorescein staining in all except the inferior zone. However, insertion of punctal plugs had minimal effect on tear cytokines and MMP-9 levels, suggesting a need for earlier treatment with anti-inflammatory agents for management of dry eye disease.""

Source: https://www.sciencedirect.com/scien...sing,ocular surface from ongoing inflammation

The study shows that punctal plugs don't help with inflammation of the eye (they don't decrease cytokine levels), but they do still decrease tear evaporation rate and relieve other symptoms of dry eyes. The conclusion from their perspective was ""punctal plugs are insufficient in treating ocular inflammation in patients with dry eyes,"" not that they were detrimental. I interpret this as: ""combination therapy would be needed to address information, but plugs are helpful for treating dryness.""

I'm not a doctor, but just intuitively, punctal plugs would need to have an effect on cytokine levels to cause any additional damage via that mechanism. If punctal plugs don't affect cytokine levels in typical eyeballs, they would presumably not affect cytokine levels in yours, despite them being high beforehand. I think you should research this more yourself, discuss this with your doc, or get a second opinion. I understand why you would be cautious, but remember, you can always just pull them out.

Interesting, I wasn't aware of that. I do still think they're worth trying, especially if money isn't a major factor. Though, you'd want a doctor who believes in their merits if you're skeptical. Like some others have said, finding a good specialty doctor would probably be worth it.

Do you think pushing it up to 70% is worth a shot? Your AC will pull the water out, but you could run a humidifier in your bedroom or living room to keep the RH elevated there.

Losing coping mechanisms is an extra insult to your literal injury. You really need an outlet of some kind. Something to be passionate about that's not affected by this. I hope you can find that.

That's just plain false and unfair. You did something to improve yourself (which is commendable) and got screwed. That's it. It's absolutely not your fault and it could have happened to anyone, mildly dry eyes or not. Dry eyes aren't even a disqualifying pre-condition. According to the Modern LASIK Outcomes study, only 1.2% of patients reported being ""dissatisfied"" with their surgery after 6 months (n=9726), and I'd wager a massive chunk of that was just inadequate correction.

Anyone deciding on a method, should make sure to consider all possible things that can go wrong, and be aware of them, even if the probability of failure is relatively low. I would hate to say ""oh yeah, you're good to go"" and then find out you're a fucking vegetable. No one wants to feel responsible for something like that.

The quality variance of fent is so far and wide that just calling it fent doesn't tell you much. If you're opioid naive then its about as reliable as any method you could hope for.

As long as you take the lethal dose it doesn't matter which way you ingest it. Your only problem is keeping it in for long enough and preparing beforehand.

For a substance OD to succeed, the mixture has to stay in your body enough for a large quantity of it to be absorbed in order for it to be fatal.

,2591009,nottinghams,"Jul 9, 2024 at 6:45 PM","out of curiosity, why does swallowing it with water make it worse? if someone did want to 'eat' the powder, its kind of difficult to swallow without a liquid anyway lol.
when did I say i tested purity with strips? the strips identified it as being fentanyl quite quickly. as for purity the only hurt to your ctb would be how much its cut, and whether it was cut professionally.
after all people who sell it want repeat customers usually...not dead ones.

and many people are 'successfully dead' who've never used fent in their life and find it accidentally (along with maybe some nitazenes) in their first snort of heroin. it is really fatal.
it is still one of the most fatal substances in the world. even with the hysterical press. It has a duality of both being used for pain relief in-hospital and being ferociously deadly.z

suicide..is almost never something, when 'winged' is successful, Unless you live nearby a 100 foot cliff drop. There is planning. But idk what kind of 'wing' you are talking about. Most ordinary people have to plan somewhat to buy fentanyl. you know how many pms ive gotten asking for the source??

Really some of the only things I'd tell to most ordinary people abt suicide by fentanyl overdose is watch for the vomiting. if you vomit it up, then obviously its not killing you. if you can bypass your digestive tract with something that also has high bioavailability, you are being better safe than sorry. these include IV and IM (or intramuscular). IM is just sticking a needle in a muscle. like if you ever played pretend as a kid, you might have played doctor like that.
but really I can't think of any other thing (that the vast majority of people would not run into) that would prevent fentanyl from killing you that way, with IM or IV.
SI, or survival instinct on the other hand..it might inadvertently make you take extra steps due to your fear. or maybe that's just what my own mind has experienced. im in so much pain from illness right now I think it's addling my mind. other people have not had the same 'fear' experiences.

also SI does not necessarily mean someone secretly does not want to die, that's bullcrap. there are human instincts. if somebody wants to die..that's their choice. They might need help getting over such a paralyzing fear.

so sorry i guess? for saying testing purity. I tested if it was fentanyl or not. it was. I have determined now my own personal sample has been cut, but professionally. Like said. repeat customers, not dead ones.

and..yes, ik you said you cannot wing it. but you are acting like death by fentanyl overdose is some difficult quest and what the other user was saying abt fentanyl was 'winging it'.
like you are very likely to die. its abt as likely for one with no tolerance as a gunshot to the head, or vaulting yourself off a cliff.

While I do have depression (persistent depressive disorder to be specific: not all depression is the same) I was suicidal and acted on that before I had met the criteria for depression.

This year it went from Major Depressive to what we are certain is Psychotic Depression. Nothing is enjoyable anymore, not even music. We are well past the point of just losing interest in everything, including the few things we used to have strong interest in. We completely lose all apatite and even gain a terrible revulsion to food. We often go days without eating anything. Sometimes weeks. We can never gain weight that we know would at least make us feel better about our body. And then when we lose weight, we see ourselves as masc again and we cannot stand that and it turns into an endless loop. We already hate our body so much as it is not our body and never has been. Nothing feels real. Everything feels like some awful semi-realistic dream, or some cruel simulation.
We lost access to a lot of our emotional range and lose our limited ability to express our emotions. We often hallucinate things that can't possibly be there according to logic whether it be seeing things out of our central vision move only to have no evidence they did or could have or sometimes we smell the most random things out of nowhere... Mostly scents from our past it seems (usually tied to strong 'memories', sometimes something new and unidentifiable. Just last night, we were hallucinating our ex's personal scent and immediately started to cry which was unusual. Most of the time we can't even cry anymore. Other times, we can't stop for hours at a time in episodes sometimes lasting days.
Sometimes we feel like there is something else in our apartment with us even though the door is always locked and it is impossible for anything to get in here. It always just feels like a presence, like we can feel another consciousness in the room just observing us quietly. Sometimes the presence feels different and feels like it is pushing certain thoughts onto us to trigger another episode.
We feel like we deserve everything bad that happens to us, although we don't know why we feel that way. We don't feel we deserve to get better, and are doubtful we even can. We feel the purpose of our existence is to test the limits of suffering on the mind. Sometimes it's like something else tries to take over us when things get really bad and it feels like we are just pushed out of our own mind and tend to remember absolutely nothing afterwards aside from feeling locked out. (Fairly certain it isn't another alter aside from the 3 we know of although it is a possibility.) When it gets really bad, we find we are unable to speak out loud at all. If we try to force past that, we have a very hard time forming even a single coherent sentence. We get unbearable urges to hurt ourselves, and usually give in to them. If we don't give in to them, they just build until they push everything else out. Negative things get amplified so easily. Partners not messaging us first or in response is one of the absolute worst triggers we have. We take it as outright rejection and abandonment and skip the spiral and switch straight from bad to dangerously bad. And honestly, we feel we aren't worthy of any interaction and deserve to be alone until we finally can't take it anymore and break again. We also push people away a lot, especially those we care about. They don't deserve to deal with our pain and can't help anyway.
The depression never eases up anymore, the psychotic symptoms come and go, usually getting much worse later in the evening until we are finally exhausted enough to risk sleep again. Feeling like we deserve this misery is constant. We don't know who we are anymore. All of our memories feel fake, like we made them up to fill in gaps in our memory of which there are many. Oh, and when it gets really bad, the internal conflicts between us get very bad. We just had an issue where the internal conflict got so bad we broke down confused and started crying with zero warning. Out of us, one of 3 somehow have hope. The other two that try to take on the pain from her can't remember the last time either of them had any hope. They feel we never should have opened ourselves up again after our ex and we wouldn't have if they were allowed to have any input on that decision at the time.
Sorry this is so long. There is a lot on our mind today and we are in the middle of a psychotic episode mixed with severe disassociation and this thread seems perfect to vent while avoiding heavier topics for now as those just make us hurt so much more.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I genuinely believe incurable depression (the one that goes beyond life stresses like discrimination and poverty; in that case it's a symptom of oppression, which isn't a disease but just as tragic) is a terminal illness for some people, like how cancer can be terminal. It's a shame ppl don't see it this way.


What I mean is I was worrying about this job not working out when the odds were high I got the job. Catastrophizing, you see. It's a cognitive distortion. Guess what, I was worrying over nothing. I do paperwork tomorrow at 2:30. And of course I am still worrying about what could possibly go wrong, despite this being ~good news~

My brain keeps telling me this is a mistake, they're gonna change their mind and I don't have this job. Or if I take it I will hate it, or fail, or get fired

One person recognized that there was a stage after depression that required its own category.

Saying I'm depressed is complete bullshit at this point. It's like not eating for a week, then declaring you want a ""snack.""

Not sleeping for a month and saying you could use a ""nap.""

It's dishonest and far too understated. I'm famished. I'm exhausted. Snacks and naps won't cut it.

For me, depression was manageable. This new stage of whatever I'm experiencing is anything but.

What do you call it when your primary source of peace is alternating fantasies of being shot through your eye socket and/or having your throat slit?

It calms me down. I started doing this 27 years ago: using specific images of my death as a means of regulating my emotions and it's the only technique that's consistently worked.

Of which I was a loyal member for quite some time. Though this was a bit of time ago - now. . . When they referred me to one or two of his other, ""colleagues.""

First and foremost. The obvious.

According to a 1997 study from the University of Harvard, Firearms wield a 82.5% success rate. Where as drugs have a 1.5% SUCCess rate (C what I did there)? Now of course, if you're not American, it's pretty much impossible to get a reliable gun. Although black powder is a thing, and I will get into that, because you know, I think renaissance festival enthusiasts are pretty cool (It's a joke laugh). Okay. Anywho. Let's talk guns.

I think that there has been some misconceptions with guns and reliability.

'But TAW122 I can get N.'

https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/us/06ttdrug.html

While a totally old article, it still makes valid points and has correctly predicted trends in the United States. N is being manufactured less and less, and the legal demand for it just is not there. So yes. I'm sure they still use it in Mexico and other third world countries. It is also expensive. Are you truly ready for the painstaking and irritating time of finding a dark market, finding a reliable seller, and risking criminal prosecution (such as being intercepted by customs and all that shit)?

'But TAW122, I cannot purchase guns, I R not American'

In the UK, France, Italy, Poland, Czech Republic, and Serbia, you can purchase black powder replicas without a license.

Germany and Spain won't let you. Sorry ya'll if you live there. (Try moving to another country in Europe or so if possible.)


Guns beat drugs every day of the week. Sorry guys. When it comes to reliability. This is how it works. Now. Before we get into the joys of muzzle loading and you renaissance festival lovers, we're going to discuss for everyone in North America.

If you live in the US and do not live in California, Illinois, Oregon, Washington, or New York, and you have not committed a felony, and have not broken ATF regulations. You can purchase a gun. Congratulations.

plz read the laws and make sure you follow them okay, thanks guise

If you're going to catch the bus with a firearm in the US or Canada, using anything short of a shotgun is not really reliable (unless you are experienced with firearms and know how to shoot it well, where to aim, steady hands, etc).

'But TAW122, I have a .44 revolver/only have access to a handgun.'

If you can afford a shotgun, you should REALLY consider buying one. Plus, I believe in many states long guns (aside from the anti-gun, 2A hating states) are generally easier to come by. I live in NC so I have the opposite problem (NC has a pistol purchase permit law which is a holdover from the Jim Crow era and only serves to inconvenience people to buy handguns).

This bad boy costs UNDER $200 (as of current price). This is a fully functional and god-tier shotgun. The coolest part about owning a shotgun is when you cock it. It's just a sexy sound.

'But TAW122, how do I buy a gun from le Internet?'



TL;DR - Your gun is shipped to a nearby guy who has a FFL. He holds the gun. You go to his place. He does the background check. You leave with your firearm.

'But ammo'

https://www.budsgunshop.com/catalog/product_info.php/cPath/656_2081/products_id/60359

This is the only round you need. This is overkill and generally good if you can get it. However, birdshot does work too, and I personally have #4 shot, which will still be sufficient especially at point blank range.

'But TAW122, I am a minor'

Well, you shouldn't own a firearm in the first place. Wait until you are an legal adult (18 in the US), and then move out and/or go and buy one.

'But TAW122, I have never shot one before'




Watch some youtube videos, go to a local range where you live or something.

'But TAW122, I live in a state with harsh gun laws'

Muzzle Loaders and Black Powder. READ EM.

'But TAW122, I am an adult, yet live with my parents'

If you buy the firearm online and have it shipped to your FFL, it should literally take 30 minutes for a background check to be completed. You can be in and out in 30 minutes. EZ PZ.

'But TAW122, I can't do that.'

Muzzle Loaders do not require an FFL. You can have shipped right to your front door.

'But TAW122, black powder/muzzle loading when?'



It is just a bit more complicated, but with enough guides and videos on the Internet, I believe you should be able to figure it out.

'TAW122, plz make a recommendation on a firearm for me'

These are just a few examples (see above).

'But TAW122, you said not to use a handgun nor a rifle'

The first example is not a handgun. It's a hand cannon. There is a difference.

'But TAW122, I live in Europe, I can't buy my guns online'

There are many gun stores in the UK that will allow you purchase REALLY overpriced renaissance festival cosplay equipment. Remember, when you go into the gun store, you're buying it because you're going to be Ollie Cromwell or Henry the 8th or something. Act enthused and passionate.

'But TAW122, I live in East Asia (China, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, etc.)'

Gun ownership in Asia, especially in East Asia is very restricted and civilian ownership is pretty much banned.

'But TAW122, I live in Oceania, (Australia, New Zealand, Polynesia, Micronesia, etc.)'

Afaik, @stargazer has mentioned that is it very difficult to legally obtain a firearm in those countries.

'But TAW122, in the UK, licenses, licenses, licenses'

https://www.shootinguk.co.uk/guns/ammunition/back-to-black-72074

You must demonstrate a good reason for having one. Possession of, and intent to use, a gun that is only proofed for black powder is a good reason.

'But TAW122, you did not list my country, or give me adequate information.'

Hollywood representations of gun suicides are a very, very bad template to follow. Shooting yourself in the temple, or holding the gun under your chin, is a BAD idea, for either pistol or long-gun attempts. The odds are good you won't hit the all-important brainstem, but will instead blow out your frontal lobe and end up a vegetable. Some people have even blown off the entire front of their face and lived --and been able to survive without a life support machine. If you think your life is bad now...

,155053,TiredHorse,"Dec 10, 2018 at 6:42 PM","Handguns are perfectly functional, with the caveat that you need to use a large enough caliber. Technically speaking, any gun can work, but below a certain size threshold your chances of success drop significantly.

Modern handguns:

@Threads's preference for a .357 is well founded. A .357 is the benchmark against which all other calibers are measured for ""stopping power.""

Gun calibers can be extremely confusing --the more you look, the more confused you'll get-- but a good rule of thumb could be:

Revolver: anything .38 Special (marginal! --see note under ammunition) or larger --.357, .44, .45 Colt, .45ACP, etc.
Semiautomatic: anything 9mm or larger --.40, 10mm, .357Sig, .45

Avoid in either type of pistols: .22, .25, .32, .380, .38ACP. Will some of these smaller calibers work? Yes --technically. I have a .32 Auto that is likely to be my choice since it'll leave less mess than my .45ACP. The .380, aka 9mm Largo, is a good round, especially with modern ammo. BUT, you had better be very confident of your aim (I have shot competitively). If you are reading this thread with even a shadow of a doubt about where you need to aim, you should not look at these smaller calibers.

Revolver or semiautomatic?:

Revolvers are mechanically simpler and often attract less attention during purchase. You can also find them with a 2"" ""snub nose"" barrel that makes them very easy to handle.

Semiautomatics have become far more common than revolvers, so might be easier to acquire, but they are more mechanically complex.

And once again, Hollywood is a shitty place to learn about how to use either.

Ammunition:

Always, always, always use hollowpoints, sometimes abbreviated in conversation and on the box itself ""JHP"" (Jacketted Hollow Point). JHPs deliver all the kinetic force of the bullet in as short a distance as possible. I.e., into your head, rather than into the wall on the other side of you. The brand doesn't matter; they all work.

If you are using a .38 Special revolver, which is marginal, look for ammunition labled ""+P"" or ""+P+"". These are designations meaning the ammunition has been loaded with more powder than the standard ammunition, and thus will deliver more power.",155031,,,,,,,,,,,,

As Threads says, .45ACP is a rare round for revolvers. You can find them, typically for use in competitive shooting, but they're enough of a specialty that you probably don't want to bother. If you want something bigger than .357 in a revolver, you could try .45 Colt, which is the more powerful, revolver-specific ancestor to .45ACP.

As I said, calibers can get confusing. With only a few exceptions, revolvers and semi-autos take completely different calibers, despite there being apparent similarities. .45ACP and .45 Colt are completely different calibers, and not even remotely interchangeable.

If you're set on using a semiautomatic, 10mm is a damned powerful round --but again, they aren't very common, despite how much hype the arms industry tried to give them a couple decades ago. A 9mm hollowpoint will do the trick, as will a .40 or a .45ACP.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,155146,TiredHorse,"Dec 10, 2018 at 8:14 PM","I'm going to risk @Threads's wrath here and --to annoy the rest of you all-- get a bit verbose.

.357Mag is the gold standard of what is popularly known as ""stopping power."" This is a hazy and arbitrary yardstick of what it takes for a cop to shoot a bad guy and have them go down and stay down. It is also a hotly contested yardstick, even if all of us gun-nuts agree that .357Mag is still the datum.

.357Mag won its place as the gold standard fair and square, but it won it at a time when most cops carried revolvers. Semi-autos --and therefore 9mm, .45ACP, and a host of other modern rounds-- weren't in the running. The primary contestant was the .38 Special, which is much less powerful, and thus didn't have a chance in the competition.

It should be pointed out that the military has never used the .357Mag. It has always (in the last 70 years) used the .45ACP and 9mm. And the military really, really likes stopping power.

.357Mag is still the gold standard for stopping power because it is, incontestably, a very, very powerful round. However, very few cops carry it any more except as a back-up revolver hidden somewhere under their body armor. There are two primary reasons for this: 1) Cops want more than six shots per gun, meaning they want to carry semi-autos, and there are very few (two?) semi-autos chambered in .357Mag; and 2) 9mm and .45ACP have resoundingly proven themselves to have perfectly adequate ""stopping power.""

Meaning 9mm and .45ACP, as well as a bunch of other calibers, all carried by LEOs and the military, have plenty of stopping power as well.

What I'm trying to explain is that while the .357Mag is an excellent choice for a caliber with which to be certain to ctb, it is not the minimum caliber capable of ensuring you ctb. There are certainly calibers that are much too small to be effective --only a complete idiot would attempt to ctb with .25ACP-- but there are many calibers less powerful than .357Mag with which you can be confident of success.

(ETA: @Threads, you're cheating: those tests are a JSP vs. FMJ. Of course the .45ACP looks pooky by comparison.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,

m on Zoloft right now. I have adhd and possible OCD (Psychiatrist implied as much, nothing official) and it's been different. Not to be one of those ""try everything before you ctb"" people but like, unless you have a good reason not to try it then I don't see why not.

Give it a few week, it took me 8 weeks before I noticed a difference. My internal monologue and daydreaming became lesser and I went from porn addicted to asexual which was odd. However, in hindsight I was my most suicidal in all my life during those first 6 weeks. I haven't noticed any weight gain in the 9 months I've been on it and times where I wished more than anything that I was dead (like during holidays or my birthday) I have found to be easier. However, with people who did gain weight, most found their weight reverted back to their original weight after quitting the medication. If it doesn't work for you and you gain weight, you can probably just taper off and at worst be where you are right now.

I think my current suicidal ideation is a product of the long lasting depression and suicidal thoughts I've had from a young age. Almost like an addiction that gets fed every time someone says something that reminds me of a bad memory. I don't know if I want to live or not, I go in and out of that decision often, but I would say that the medication 100% made my life less depressing. It's not a cure, but it helped me.

Hope this helps. Also, as a reminder, you are probably more likely to get answers from people who weren't all that impacted or affected by the medication because if it did do its job they probably wouldn't be here. These experiences are plenty real and don't dismiss them, but as with many medications you can't really know until you try it.
It is okay if your happiness/wellbeing is store bought, 100%

I'm unsure if my possible OCD has worsened over the years or if I've been like this since I was born, inclining to the second option the more I analyze myself.

subsequently, these are my symptoms:

compulsive lying.
I lie to people confidently about small things, I don't know why I do it but I hate it. For example saying ""Oh yeah I watched a movie about it, or I did my research"" though I didn't, I remember lying about things when I was a child too, for example ""I tried this chocolate called whatever""

repetitive mental speech.
sometimes I will repeat a word or phrase in my mind involuntarily, not like when you're reminding yourself of something you don't want to forget, sometimes I will randomly choose a word I just heard or thought and repeat it in my mind, for example. ""whale, whale, whale, whale, wha-le, whale""
it can go on up to an hour and its like a voice in my head, but my own, not a hallucination or anything like that.

anxiety and fixation
I am generally a mentally anxious person, but Im sure this is because of conditioning and trauma, I'm always tense and on edge, specially alert and always making plans and arranging stuff in my mind.

childhood impulsiveness.
im impulsive a lot of the time, I remember biting a kid one time because I couldn't measure my own body and the way it affects others, growing up I also injured myself a lot cause I didn't have enough bodily awareness to calculate not hitting my head on my bunk bed for example, idk.

Anyways, I'm going to talk about my OCD a little bit, since I never really get to talk about it without being judged.
One major obsession and often intrusive thought is the people I love dying. It tears me apart to think of it, as it probably would with anyone, but this is what's on my mind literally most of the time, and it kills me. This then results in a bunch of different compulsions that I do to try and stop myself from thinking about, and also as a way to ""ensure that it doesn't happen."" Like, for example, I have to check the doors are shut, I'll do it usually 4 x 2, or maybe 8 x 2. Then, before I walk away, I touch the wall 8 times and try to think of something super irrelevant. If I don't, my brain tells me that my family will die. I can't even type, hear, or think about the words ""death"" or anything even remotely violence related while thinking about a family member without also telling myself something will happen. I do a LOT of different rituals, checking, counting and other forms of compulsions to stop my other obsessions, and it sucks. The one I talked about is just an example of the many different things that occur for me. It takes up so much of my day and I hate it. It causes me so much anxiety and as I get older, it just gets worse. I always loved reading, but I can't even do that anymore due to OCD.

,2339768,Synfrome,"Feb 1, 2024 at 11:21 AM","Anyone else have such a crippling fear of rejection/failure/criticism that they can't form proper relationships? I've only met maybe two or three people who have the same thing as me but none of them have ever had it as bad as me and it makes me feel so isolated. Everytime I've tried to CTB that's been the main reason. I've had almost three years of counselling focused on this and it hasn't significantly improved in any way and I'd argue, in some respects, it's gotten worse.

For simplicity's sake, I'm going to refer to it as RSD (Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria) because I think that's what it is. I have autism and potentially comorbid ADHD so it'd make sense. I've shown symptoms of RSD since I was a young child; however, it really kicked in around the age of seven when my mum got with my now step dad. I would scream and cry everytime they held hands, hugged, kissed, etc because it'd evoke this fear in me that has followed me around ever since that I was being replaced. Every close relationship I've had since then I've felt that fear on some level fairly frequently if not as a constant. Every romantic relationship I've been in has been miserable because every waking moment I was conscious of the fact I was in a relationship I was wracked with anxiety over when they'd finally leave me. It usually makes me act in one of two ways:

1. I get anxious/scared they're going to leave and I start acting overly clingy and pathetic.

2. I become convinced they're intentionally trying to make me suffer so I become cold, dry and spiteful towards them.

Either way I sabotage the relationship because the people I am partners/friends with obviously don't want to be around someone like that but I can't help it. To make matters worse, if they're genuinely kind/caring towards me it scares me for some reason which causes me to retreat further. It feels like either way I can't win. I also have generalised anxiety and a very vivid imagination, meaning I have long daydreams about catastrophe scenarios (a common one is me being assaulted) which I find incredibly hard to block out my head. Not sure if those are intrusive thoughts or what but regardless it's not fun. Of course I suppress/mask most of this around others otherwise I'd be a vile person but it's exhausting and it feels like no one understands the extent of what I'm going through. I feel incredibly isolated.

On the other hand, school has not helped at all with this. I went to a grammar school with little to no pastoral care for five years with undiagnosed autism/anxiety which completely mentally destroyed me. The stress of insane amounts of work, the fear of failing and the, at times, dehabilitating pressure of exams has permanently changed how my brain is wired, especially because it occured at such a formative time in my life. Everytime I'm around the area that school is in it activates my fight or flight. Even now I'm at a comprehensive Sixth Form these anxieties haven't gone away and mentally plague me daily. I'm never happy with my results, never happy with my art, never happy with anything I produce because all I can think about is how I could've done a better job. I'm getting straight As and A*s and I still feel nothing and it's crushing.

RSD has been genuinely ruining my life for over a decade now and I don't see any hope of me getting better and finally being able to be sane enough to have a relationship/friendship where I'm not convinced the other person is either going to leave me or is trying to make me suffer. I don't see how I could be happy with my output in the future and university is looking more and more bleak as it draws closer. I just don't want to be like this anymore. It feels like I'm constantly in anguish.

Anyone else?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2340219,strawberryseed,"Feb 1, 2024 at 6:30 PM","yes ! i feel like you were able to put into words exactly how it feels and i struggle with the same issues. I won't talk to people unless they approach me first and I try to keep a straight face and create an unapproachable energy because i just already feel disliked i don't even want to try anymore. i don't feel close to anyone, it's really just feeling like a burden to the human existence and the isolation creates a dark space to sit in since you can't really tell anyone how you feel fully, you'll be a problem. I don't make eye contact or say hi to others and people get so offended by it, but the thought of just expressing so openly and saying hi just makes my skin burn and a million thoughts run through my head. I'm always daydreaming about fake scenarios which can cause a lot of distress to me and just makes everything worse and i can't make it stop for some reason.

I cant perform well on things i know or want other people to see as i'm an artist too ! but i never finish or do anything w my projects because I don't think they're good enough and I have a group of people i went to grade school with who i obsess over in thinking they have amazing talent and good taste, i want to stop thinking about them and putting them on a pedestal but my mind doesn't let me. it's exclusive to these people and what they might think of me even though i don't know what they think of me and are not even in my life and we never really spoke. I just obsess from afar and there's no good reason for it. but it leaves me feeling so subpar to everyone. And i did recently leave a relationship due to some hard rejection and hurtful actions, my ex fell so so deeply in love with another person and wanted them to move in with him immediately after a week of having met her in person. and that he didnt want to see me as much (we were in a polyamorous relationship) because i was too much for him and if we spent too much time together it would make him not like me. now all he does is post about her, talk about her, ruined all my friendships w people close to me and compared me to her extensively and told me i'll drive away everyone with my mental health issues and won't be able to be in a relationship and was telling this to others as well. it hurts bad to constantly be rejected and when it stems from childhood it just feels pointless to try when you know you cant depend on anyone. my mom would leave for long periods at a time just to be with my dad or another boyfriend, i would sometimes worry that she was dead after not hearing from her from more than a week. i just don't feel like anyone will be able to stand being in my life for a long time and it's making me bitter and more alone. i lie to my therapist about my plans to kill my self because this sort of loneliness just feels insurmountable and i need to find peace from this anxiety and heavy self loathing, id like to recover but life has just not been working for me and i can't be myself around anyone.",2339768,,,,,,,,,,,,

How to preserve N after opening,2551091,madasco,"Jun 6, 2024 at 2:53 PM","Hi! Imagine you have a few small bottles of N and do not want your family to find them.

So you open them and put all their content into a larger bottle with no label (you keep the bottle safely guarded ofc).

This is your insurance to CTB a few years later when your physical condition worsens.

How long would the N remain effective?

Would you need to pump out the air/oxygen from the large bottle so that you create a vacuum and N is not oxygen-degraded?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

There isn't a pathway for it to really oxidize quickly from nitrite to nitrate without higher temperature. If the lid is closed and perhaps covered with plastic wrap you won't have tremendous degradation as a solid at room temperature over time. When I say not much, the degradation takes 330 degrees C for 1 gram to fully degrade in one hour, and a typical rule of thumb is doubling a reaction rate for every 10 degrees (that's rough). So at room temperature you are 1/2 to the power of 30 or so less likely to degrade completely so basically a buttload longer than you need to worry about especially if you keep it dry and closed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I only knew about sodium nitrite turning into nitrate. Thanks for explaining the meaning of hygroscopic. It's convenient when people assume others just know terms like that and then I have to go on a bunch of google searches to try to understand the term.

I've managed to get myself into a relationship, my very first one. I've never had experience and I didn't think I would, I have a lot of issues with my own inability to ""want"" real sex and receiving affection is extremely difficult. But when he asked me out I got so happy and said yes and when we talk I just don't think realistically and go on about what I like and want and he agrees.

We've only been together for a few weeks but I've shared my first kiss, make-out session, and a little more but nothing much. He's so very kind, genuine, clingy, needs reassurance and verbal consent, he's so fun, and I really connect with him but sometimes I realize this might not be right? Or morally okay?

I mean he wants everything that I really ""want"" but in retrospect, I know that I'm talking about dreams and desires not actually smth I think I'm going to achieve one day, and he doesn't know that.

I've only ever warned him about SH-scars covering my legs but my ctb-date is set in time and this is really all a waste of HIS time. I feel fucking awful since I've been super up-front about really liking him and wanting are relationship to go far, I feel like it would tear him apart if I just break up with him out of the blue thinking he did smth wrong? What makes it even more complicated is that he's an associate for another dept. in the same company I work. It'd be IMPOSSIBLE not to see him the majority of the week if I did end things.

Can I really bring a topic like this up? Like extremely fluffed and gently, not so much ""I'm gonna ctb but I thought you'd make a great husband and dad""… If I can somehow explain things down-to-Earth he might just understand that I don't want to risk hurting him a LOT in the future if I just pretended and then decided to still ctb. He wants a partner, a companion, and a family, and I don't think I can give that to him even if we've been going great.

Honestly, I think it's only fair that someone knows if they want to get close. It's such a tricky situation really. Not really your fault though. We're only human. For whatever reason, we're stuck here living day to day. Of course we want to feel comforted where we can. I'd feel so confused if I met someone now. It's something I've always wanted.

I hope this won't turn into a debate. I fully accept that this subject matter is silly to those who don't relate.

Just wondering if anyone can relate to my frustrations. At some point I came to the conclusion that our five senses can't perceive all there is in reality (due to multiple drug experiences). This opened the door for me to explore more esoteric avenues.

I tried praying, meditation, reading scripture, water-fasting for three weeks, fasting and abstaining sexual activity at certain points of the lunar calendar (""sacred secretion""), Neville Goddard, yoga, kundalini-related breathing and exercise techniques, and much more. The full list is long and laughably dumb, but I was really reaching for a spiritual connection out of sheer desperation, a type of connection that MANY people testify having from doing a lot less.

It's frustrating because you hear a lot about ""unconditional love"" in these sort of circles, and how all you have to do is ""just ask for it and receive it bro."" Yet, here I am doing all this work over the course of years with nothing to show for it. I know nothing is owed and I sound like a spoiled brat, but it's discouraging. It's like opening the door for God or ""love"" to come in, meeting halfway and putting in the effort, yet no one shows up. The religious and spiritual will start moving goalposts, saying you didn't do this or that. If you name it, I very likely tried it. Only thing is I haven't tried lately is asking people to pray for me. Seems a bit too selfish to ask for someone flawed like me. I'll only disappoint those people. I had a previous experience with a church group in my youth that prayed for me and I am ashamed of how I turned out despite all their kindness and hope towards me.

After some years, at the end of of my patience, all I started asking for was simply communication from Jesus/God. That's it. I haven't received anything unfortunately.

Anyone else have related experiences?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

They often assume I only ever asked for things and never really tried to be a good member of my religion, and that's just not true. For years, I prayed, attended services, changed who I was, and spent money and effort making offerings and doing things to show my praise and loyalty. If all that's not enough for me to get any help from any god, then nothing will ever be enough, and it feels pointless.

If I'm delusional, as some people have suggested, I'v been under some strange kind of delusion for 50 years, including through three years of university. The whole premise of Christianity is what a lot of us say on here, that this world is screwed up. Rather than make everyone robots so they obey God without any free will, God sent His Son to die for us to make everything right. (Many will complain at me writing this but the poster did ask!)

Not that I haven't had my doubts .... I have big time but as I said, the point about Christianity is this life is screwed, we will have rubbish times here but we have been given a way to a much better life afterwards. If it's delusional, millions of people through the centuries have all somehow been delusional and been willing to go through torture rather than deny their ""delusion"" (you'd think delusions would vanish pretty quickly when faced with extreme torture.)

Again, not trying to preach to anyone as I'm messed up anyway. Not God's fault, my own choices and I'm here, trying to think of a way to get ""there"" (heaven.) I've had enough of all of this going on here/my life and can't take much more, even with believing in the Christian faith.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

what the fuck do i want from myself,2587169,BoneWeary57,"Jul 6, 2024 at 11:23 AM","First, take a deep breath..now..being in your teens or late teens is a time that most people that age care about what others think, worry about being accepted, etc. But here is what you learn as life goes on..being ""normal"" is all relative - the definition of normal varies from person to person..for example, normal for some is working Monday thru Friday 8-5, weekends and holidays off, for others it's working 12 hour night shifts, normal for some is same sex, consenting adult relationships, others heterosexual relationships while others have zero interest in any romatic/sexual relationships. There is nothing wrong with any of them. They are just..different based on the person.
You say you act weird..meaning..not like others? Ok..well, you are unique and that's a good thing. You are also still developing how to navigate life, meeting new people, new situtations. old enough yet still young. That's ok too.
It seems you are hyper focused on what others think about you and are assuming how they view you..but you don't really know what they think unless you have asked them. It sounds like you do have people who care about you and maybe, just maybe, you present a little needy because you are so worried about fitting in etc. That is a lot for someone else to take on and frankly, it's not anyone elses job to fix whatever you think is wrong with you - it's yours. Now, that being said, have you considered just being YOU? Weird, wonderful, socially awkard? Whatever you think your ""faults"" are - just - reframe how you view them - not as a hinderance but as your..superpower?
You alluded to being gay if I read part of your post correctly - so? If you are a decent human, who gives two shits what someone else thinks? Seriously..at the end of your life, whenever that may be, do you really think that will matter? What some stranger or aquantience thinks? I sure hope not.
As far as the guy you are wanting in your life..maybe, just maybe what you see in him is what you want for yourself in terms of being confident or whatever. And maybe, just maybe if you take a deep breath, get some professional help if you can, he may come back around. Like you want a companion, he does too. He wants an equal in a relationship I suspect, he doesn't want to be a therapist or life perserver for someone long term - nor should he be.
You have a chance, you sound like a truly caring, thoughful person. Cut yourself some slack, be your imperfect self, try not to worry or care about what 99% of the people in life think about you and if you can do that, just a small amount, I promise you, your life will expand in wonderful ways you have never thought of.

Nitrite turns into nitrate after some time of being exposed to oxygen which is why you need to use SN as soon as the seal is broken. Nitrate is safe and harmless, while nitrite is the one needed for CTB. The purity of that is really important so I would suggest testing it because otherwise if your dose isn't enough, you'll experience all the unpleasant symptoms of SN, but you won't die.
Failure to CTB with SN is really common here because it takes an extended period to die and sometimes people don't dose themselves enough, so I would take extra precaution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

The fact that death is permanent is exactly why I’d wish for it,2558073,FuneralCry,"Jun 12, 2024 at 8:25 AM","The fact that death is permanent is exactly why I'd wish for it, I'd never be able to understand those anti-suicide people who act like a permanent solution is something supposedly so bad. For me no matter what existence itself will always be the true problem with ceasing to exist being the solution to this, no longer existing would solve everything for me and bring peace from this existence so undesirable and futile.

I'd always prefer to not exist and I only find comfort in death, permanent non-existence is all that's ideal to me as it's the eternal absence of all suffering and harm, I will never see what's so bad about being unable to suffer in any way, existence is what's bad instead and under no circumstances would I ever wish to be trapped in this existence suffering for decades just to be tortured by old age and die anyway. It's terrifying how there's no limit as to how much one can be tormented as long as they exist, it's so disturbing to me how one can suffer so unbearably yet not die.

All I've ever wished for is eternal nothingness especially as there are no disadvantages to being unaware for all eternity, I envy those who no longer exist as they are no longer burdened with this existence and it isn't their problem anymore but of course only never existing is true perfection, I wish I never existed more than anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why do most people not consider suicide as a solution to all of their issues?,2576574,ijustwishtodie,"Jun 27, 2024 at 10:24 AM","It doesn't make sense to me. I see so many people complain about life and our current system. I'm now starting to think that most people don't actually enjoy life to the extent that they claim they do and that instead they're just trying to make the best out of the one existence that they have. People do enjoy parts of their lives but they suffer too. Their first thought isn't suicide but rather about being more resilient and adapting themselves to be a better cog in the system than everybody else.

I would understand it if they did think about suicide but didn't act on it due to being too scared of the consequences but the issue is that they don't consider suicide as a solution at all. Now of course this may sound incorrect as they do say the ""suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem"" quote. However, I think that, when they use that quote, they are just saying it in autopilot instead of actually thinking about what they're saying. I think that they don't see suicide as a solution at all.

Does anybody know why they don't see suicide as a solution to all of their issues? After all, with a successful suicide attempt, they no longer have to wage slave, they no longer have to suffer, they no longer have to complain or risk getting hurt in the future. This sentiment of mine is amplified when looking at people in third world countries. No matter which way you try and spin it, death does end all suffering and pain that your current self experiences forever",,,,,,,,,,,,,

People who are used to that rhythm are obliged to follow it to feel relief, or they can confront suicide ideation.

Suicide is a solution to suffering after all as it's only possible to suffer if you are alive. If they don't want to solve the issue of suffering, what exactly do they want to solve? They must want something to be solved otherwise they wouldn't complain about their lives, right?
But then why are they not suicidal? This feels like circular reasoning to me.
I see non existence as a relief though. Sure, the non existent person can't actually feel the relief due to the self explanatory reason of them being non existent but, comparing their lives to non existence, they are in relief. 0 is a higher number than any negative number on the number scale after all.
I don't see it as an answer to my question. I get that they enjoy life sometimes and adapt as much as possible but my question is.. why choose that over suicide? Even if they enjoy life sometimes, they do have moments of suffering. Nobody enjoys life 24/7. There are lots of hardships and suffering in life. I get that people are more resilient than I am but, even so, life is difficult for them too as they complain about it anonymously on the internet.

They have the same drives, motivations, wants and goals. There's a reason why propaganda works, because it appeals to the collective unconscious. Anyways, the vast majority of people submit to, follow and obey authority. I think it's been programmed and conditioned in them to do so. That's why they just follow the roadmap that society sets for them, never questioning why or what exactly it is that they want. Most people believe and think what society tells them to think, and do what society tells them to do. Suicide is a taboo topic in our society and is highly stigmatized, so I think that most people shy away from entertaining suicidal thoughts because society tells everyone that suicide is bad, shameful, disgraceful and dishonorable. Society says that suicide is the coward's way out to discourage and prevent people from committing suicide.

Normies are also living life on autopilot and instinct. I doubt that any normies have sentience. They seem low sentience and low IQ to me. They're just sheep who obey and follow their shepherds. They have no minds of their own and can't think for themselves. Normies just follow the crowd and herd. They're like a hive mind and they all buy into groupthink due to herd mentality. Normies are wageslaves who think that they're free, but freedom is slavery. They're prisoners who don't even know that they're in prison. Some of them don't even have the awareness to know that they're miserable. Wageslavery isn't even a life. It's just an existence.

Even if life's suffering outweighs relief, nonexistence will wipe away both suffering and relief. people are inherently designed to strive for relief. If we are sick, we will take medicine, if we are hungry, we will eat, if we are thirsty, we will drink. Our brains push us, even unconsciously.

From my personal experiences, I once slept during a tough, stormy night, and when I woke up, I was very delighted that I missed it. But at the same time, I found out that I also missed a delicious dinner, which made me very upset. Meaning it does not matter the degree of suffering or relief, even if I make a compromise and choose non-existence.

I first looked into extracting SN from curing salts. Curing salts seems to be a mixture of SN (NaNO2) and Sodium Chloride (NaCl) which is just table salt. There already seems to be discussions online about separating these two, and from what I've read it seems possible, but difficult. I don't think I'm qualified enough in chemistry to give an opinion though.

I also looked into getting SN (NaNO2) from Sodium Nitrate (NaNO3). Apparently, a few hobby chemists have been doing this to acquire SN after it became difficult to obtain them. There are a few videos on YouTube about it.

Once again, I don't have enough knowledge on chemistry to say anything for sure. I know nothing past basic high school chemistry. This is also another reason why I'm posting this, for someone hopefully more educated than me to provide their opinions.

I believe the main points of concern would be:

1. Purity of obtained SN
2. Checking if the substance obtained is even SN (although, I'm pretty sure this can be done with test strips?)
3. Cost
4. Safety of the process",,,,,,,,,,,,,

However calcium sulfide isn't actually easier to obtain than SN at my location, so I haven't really pursued this option further.

Doctors and support workers of all kinds have repeatedly spoke of how therapy is lifechanging and can be applied to pretty much anybody because there's supposedly so many kinds of therapy. Yet all they can offer me is shitty 6 sessions (30 min each btw) of talk therapy and cbt even though every time i try that it doesn't help. I can't afford to go private so its my only option. What is the point in telling me about all these different kinds of therapies if you can't offer me any of them anyway.

And there's a similar problem with medication, I've only tried 2-3 antidepressants but I give up atp because fluoxetine did nothing at all, i can't take my mirtazapine bc it knocks me out for almost 24hr every time and leaves me feeling like shit for the next 2 days. And the only one that did anything (sertraline) just replaced my problems with new ones. Made me indifferent to everything to the point my family had to ask me to stop taking it out of concern because I was acting like a different person.

I'm done with it, i dont want any more appointments because nothing they do can help me. Every time i attend one of them, all I can think about is how much of a waste of time it is and I feel like they're all aware of that too",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"My demented grandma is dying, I wish she could’ve found peace sooner",2563480,satanpixidreamgirl,"Jun 16, 2024 at 8:00 PM","My family just received news that grandmother is swollen up and on lasiks and is painfully dying her nursing home with two weeks to live. She had a stroke about 6-8 years ago, her second one, she always been a survivor and has had horrible health that she's came unscathed from (breast cancer twice, open heart surgery, the first stroke, stuff I was too young to even remember).

This was the first time she wasn't okay afterwards, immediately afterwards she mentally changed and started repeating questions over and over again. She eventually got diagnosed with dementia. At one point her heart started failing and she got put on a fuck ton of medications to manage that. Late last year my grandpa, who was here caretaker, passed away, his body just kinda gave out, and we where forced to send her to a nursing home a state over near where her sister lives and since then she's been rapidly deteriorating further, like the lack of my grandfather, the man she married when they where teens, is killing her further. Last time I visited her was a month a ago and as harsh as it sounds it was so nightmarish to see, she is wheelchair bound, can't speak coherently at all, has to use diapers, doesn't know where she is, can't eat hardly or hardly drinks. She's being kept alive purely on medication to suffer, and is not even herself anymore.
Right now she's on a her death bed, and she's receiving ativan and pain meds regularly. I mourned her long ago, I'm relived she's finally going to be at peace, I just wish she could find it sooner.
She's more like a mother figure to me than my own mother, I remember her teaching me how to wear makeup when I was a kid, I wanted to be just like her because she was so pretty and flashy (even though we where broke). It hurts so much to see her suffer through this much torture when she could've rested sooner.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was reading that everyone with severe physical illness or treatment resistant mental illness like depression, schizophrenia and BPD has the right to leave this planet and that is written in law.

If this is true it must be such an amazing feeling to live over there knowing that you can press the button anytime and nobody will force you to live or shove you in an institution.

Pro lifers ofc fight this and want to extend the suffering of these people, but they have no empathy and experience of what's it like when your brain totally breaks. I've seen a person in a mental health ward who was suffering from some sort of schizophrenia and he wanted to jump out of a window even though it was locked, he was that desperate...

Doctors and people working there who were suppose to understand him, thought he was a walking zombie, but there is still someone else in there experiencing all of that terror on daily basis. In Netherlands that guy along with many others would finally get some peace!",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Netherlands assisted suicide,2590649,PetrichorBirth,"Jul 9, 2024 at 12:47 PM","There exists an euthanasia-law in the Netherlands, and it specifies six conditions that physicians have to meet in order to apply euthanasia.

The law states as conditions that the physician:

1) has become convinced that the patient's request was voluntary and well-considered,
2) has become convinced that the patient's suffering was hopeless and unbearable,
3) has informed the patient about the situation they're in and about their prospects,
4) has come to the conviction with the patient that there was no reasonable alternative solution for the situation they were in,
5) has consulted at least one other, independent physician who has seen the patient and given his or her written opinion on the due care requirements referred to in sections 1 to 4
6) has carried out the termination of life or assisted suicide with due care and attention to medical procedures.


Every time an euthanasia request is carried out, the physician has to report to a regional commission. This commission will judge whether the physician followed the rules, and will publish their report, with the case of the patient on https://www.euthanasiecommissie.nl/uitspraken-en-uitleg/p-2024/documenten (these are the reports published in 2024, you can read reports from earlier years as well. Lots of very interesting reads, i recommend it, translate it into english if you want). In case that the physician hasn't followed one or more of these rules, the Dutch prosecution service will investigate against the physician.

With all of these things said, it's not mandatory for a physician to honor a patients request for euthanasia. If you ask your doc for euthanasia, and you're refused for any reason (personal beliefs, whatever), your situation gets slightly more complicated, because then you have to contact the Euthanasia Expertise Centre, and they will have to investigate your whole situation, which will prolong everything.",2227941,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mine specifically was for substances and attempted CTB by overdose. My journey away from getting fucked up has been decades in the making. Hospitals, lock-ups, shrinks, doctors and 12-Step meetings on & off since 1989.

It seems like I kept going back to my old ways despite wanting to recover.

""When at the end of the road we find that we can no longer function as a human being, either with or without drugs, we all faced the same dilemma. What is there left to do? There seems to be this alternative: either go on as best we can to the bitter ends--jails, institutions or death--or find a new way to live.""

That's from the 12-Step program I attend, but it applies. I have kept plugging away at that new way for a couple of years now. Long enough to know that there are no quick fixes, and while I'm not responsible for my mental illness, I am responsible for my recovery.

It's hard to believe that I might have been one of the very last people to receive from N and I cherish those bottles more dearly than any possession I have ever owned and will never forget the sacrifice he made for us. He might have to spend his years rotting away in a jail cell so that we wouldn't have to do the same in our daily lives.

There was no crowd of fellow dealers to blend into. So, I don't mind that he may have been profiting greatly from his endeavor and I hope he had time to live it up and enjoy the money he earned as the authorities might take it all from him. Anyway, it just so happens he did us all a service like a hero even if he's not fully aware of it. He would even provide provide people with free metoclopramide (the gold standard prescription antiemetic) and instructions on how to take it without them even asking as a gift or when he was asked politely as he never charged extra for this which shows me that I think he had some degree of knowledge the significance of what he was doing and had more empathy for people than I could ever imagine an illegal substance dealer to have. In fact, packing meto got him into even more trouble since the less suspicious and illegal things you ship out, the safer you are. Unfortunately, as one of the very last people to get N from him, he was already under a lot of heat I imagine so I didn't get any free meto even though I asked. But, he was very kind to me and walked me through the whole process and answered all my questions because I was dumb and didn't know how to do all the things like purchasing cryptocurrency. With all my extra yapping, I'm sure I looked suspicious to him like some kind of decoy agent out to gather information from him and I was very afraid he'd feel that way, but he luckily chose to do business with me.

Long story short I'm currently diagnosed with bipolar 2 and schizophrenia. These emerged on deployment as I had some hardships and quite a bit of bad decisions not only in my part but my leadership.

I was somewhat surprised to see my VA claims were accepted despite me not having a paper trail for some of the events that took place while deployed. So I guess while investigating they just have got some stuff from my unit.

I had planned to CTB in late august when I ran out of money but atm I'm looking at $2200-$3700 a month which means I can essentially live a quiet life in peace without any worries of homelessness etc.

Idk if other veteran here is having the problem of being a leech but I can't feel good about this as I feel like I serve no purpose in this world.

Nice to see you're still communicating with us.

Did anything bad happen to any of your relatives today? I appreciate it isn't over yet, but I was just wondering.

Rather than bringing others into this, what else might lower your SI (not that I'm advocating you hurting yourself or others). Would being arrested for stealing be enough ? Would telling your family you're going to kill yourself be enough? How about vandalising things - like a police station? What I'm suggesting is try to think of things that don't involve physically harming others, if you can.

When do you next see your community team?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please bear in mind though that, whoever you target could well be quite innocent. How would it feel if some random stranger just randomly attacked one of your family members because they felt compelled to do so? Voices told them to do so or whatever?

If I'm really honest, your posts do frighten me because I wonder just what you are considering. Plus, selfishly, I'm in the UK- as I believe you are. Honestly, it frightens me that some individuals out there are plotting to do harm to people I might know and care about. Unlikely of course but, you never know. Whoever you target and however badly you 'hurt' them, you could have a very profound affect on their lives and the lives of the people who care about them.

It never ends up going that way though. Every time I've seen someone act on this impulse, their actions impacted someone else & it just made their situation worse. They don't end up ctbing. If it's horrible enough they end up in jail or the hospital, and they always end up more miserable than before. The person who's hurt in the process doesn't deserve that either. Please don't bring others into your choice to ctb. Hurting others won't ensure your timeframe if you're already sure of your choice. Why do you feel making someone else suffer is necessary? I understand that shame can be a powerful motivator. With your belief that you have to die though, why do you need to manufacture a scenario where you can't back out? Why is hurting someone else the way to do that? I know that you do have empathy for other people, and I hope you take a step back and consider what following the intrusive thoughts or voices would really mean. A lot of your motivation seems to be to mitigate harm especially with your family and relatives who have been sick. So why does someone have to be harmed to force you to ctb? I hope you reconsider because you do know that harming others is wrong & it isn't something that has to happen. I deal with fairly destructive intrusive thoughts as well, so I know that it can be difficult to live in your own head hearing them. Mine get a lot worse when I haven't been sleeping. Have you been able to sleep when your parents are out of the house? Is there anywhere you could stay for a bit besides with your parents? I hope you're able to break the cycle you're in and think a little more clearly. Above all though, don't bring someone else into how much you're suffering. It's hard to feel trapped like this, but no one deserves to suffer more, especially when it's not their fault. The ends don't always justify the means.

How to induce damage to your amygdala?,2559473,justwannadip,"Jun 13, 2024 at 12:35 PM","Ya the brain is much more complex than certain regions having unilateral functions and consequences. While the amygdala places a big role in fear response, just damaging it or removing it would cause a host of issues that would likely leave you much worse than when you started.

There are more invasive procedures like deep brain stimulation, and ECT that have shown efficacy in treatment resistant cases of psychiatric disorders like depression, ocd, and ptsd, but are usually used as a last resort and are thus hard to qualify for and are quite expensive. In incredibly rare and extreme cases things like amygdalotomy have been performed but there isn't much evidence of it being helpful for psychiatric disorders. tFUS or transcranial focused ultrasound is a lesser known method that is being researched on that is similar to TMS in that it involves non-invasive stimulation that modulates brain region activity, but tFUS has the potential to reach deeper subcortical regions like the amygdala whereas other methods like TMS cannot.

Honestly, as much as I wish there was something that could just erase my intense pain and anxiety, our understanding of the brain is so minimal compared to the complexity of the organ, and many potential treatments for psychiatric disorders are underfunded. It seems like for many years to come, medication will still be pushed and treatments for complex psychiatric disorders will likely only target managing symptoms as opposed to any cure or finding the root cause.",2559419,,,,,,,,,,,,

How to induce damage to your amygdala?,2560612,willitpass,"Jun 14, 2024 at 9:52 AM","This here covers a lot of what I would already say. The amygdala does more than just control the fight or flight response. It impacts your memory, it has a role in the production of certain hormones, and controls certain autonomic responses (involuntary but important body functions such as heart rate). It even plays a role in your ability to interpret body language from others. All this to say, damaging it will lead to hormonal imbalance, memory impairment, and your fight or flight response will be so impaired that you won't be able to sense any danger at all and will end up in even more dangerous situations as a result. Yeah, maybe you'll impair your memory and fear response to traumatic events, but you also may not be able to remember your favorite song, what that super good ice cream you tried was, or what you planned on doing with your day tomorrow on vacation. You may forget any positive memories you have and may struggle to make any more.

This aside, if you somehow still wanted to do this, you couldn't. There is no way to intentionally self-induce brain damage to a specific part of your own brain. Unless surgical (and even still then), brain damage is wild and unpredictable. You don't know what part of the brain will get injured by what impact and to what degree that damage will be. Neuroplasticity is an incredible thing, people have endured EXTENSIVE brain damage and still manage to maintain and recover impossible levels of brain function. On the contrary, people endure relatively minor damage and are severely impaired for life. And this damage can mean anything from personality changes, motor dysfunction, inability to produce language and/or understand language properly, vision or hearing damage, etc, to full on brain death. The amygdala would be exceptionally impossible to induce damage to by yourself as it is located in the limbic system in the center of the brain. It is essentially nestled deep inside, cushioned by all of the outer brain matter. You couldn't reach it if you tried.

Overall a bad idea, and impossible to achieve even if you wanted to.",2559525,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anhedonia from Psychiatric Medications,2575024,N3UR0T1C,"Jun 26, 2024 at 1:37 AM","I'm reaching out for some validation and to see if anyone else shares a similar experience.

During my mid to late teen years, I had been very depressed and had attempted suicide a few times. Through this period, I was put on many different psychiatric medications (a few SSRI's, atypical antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants (off label for mood stabilization). I had been essentially medicated for the entire period between 13-17, and things came to a head with a SN suicide attempt when I was 18, which lead to my long-term hospitalization and treatment. When I got out, I truly tried to give life another chance. The medications I was on seemed to be helping, and I started making progress in my life (I found employment, started college, etc.). However, I had been experiencing anhedonia on these medications for essentially the entire time. I decided to get off my medications in order to try to relieve the anhedonia, but it never went away. I truly don't find enjoyment from anything, at least not for more than a fleeting moment. I just feel numb, all of the time. My life isn't even that bad, but these profound feelings of numbness are leading me to the point of seriously wanting to CTB again.

I feel so conflicted, because I hear stories here of people who have far worse lives than me. Life isn't even that bad for me when I look at things objectively, but I truly don't feel like life is worth living when I can't feel anything.

It's helped me so I can go outside and talk to people without feeling unbelievably shit. I used to be borderline agoraphobic; overthinking every small thing that happened to me and never leaving my house or passing windows. Therapy didn't help so I cycled through medication until finding one that was slightly more bearable.

But, in starting this medication, I relapsed into sh and can't do any of the things I enjoy anymore. I'm not completely apathetic or ""numb,"" I just can't get that sense of irreplaceable excitment that drove me to create things even when I was at my lowest. I can't draw anymore. I really, really can't.

Even when I was actively suicidal, I could at LEAST draw. I could at least get excited about the artists I looked up to, but I just can't anymore. I feel like I'm grieving a part of myself. I dont know if it sounds stupid or petty or childish.
I mean, I can function (for the most part) despite being overwhelmed with everything. I'm doing what everyone wants of me, but I just cant fucking draw.

Does anybody what happened to Funeral Cry ?,2590486,ijustwishtodie,"Jul 9, 2024 at 9:14 AM","This is my favourite comment here. Despite you disagreeing with her views, you still have understanding of her situation and also compassion for her overall. You're completely right about FC. She isn't an AI, she isn't somebody who merely wanted others to ctb without dying herself and she doesn't want attention.

People have called me FC's number 1 fan/supporter and I feel like this is because I understand FC more than other people do. Just like her, I have autism too and I think that I have autism to a similar level as hers. I don't have any chronic health conditions and I'm lucky to be okay physically health wise but I know that FC had to deal with a bunch of physical ailments as well as with autism. However, I am like her in the sense that I can't ctb become I'm homebound. I believe there's another factor that gives me and FC more obstacles to ctb and that is our executive dysfunction caused by our autism as well as getting easily overwhelmed at the slightest amount of suffering. I understand how trapped she is because I'm trapped too. I genuinely think that, with all of her conditions, she would be eligible for euthanasia but sadly euthanasia is a thing at all in the UK

It's relieving to find somebody else here who understands FC. I get that it's difficult for people to understand those who are autistic but I didn't think that it'd be so difficult to where an entire suicide forum would fail to understand her. Then again, I guess it takes one to know one hence why I can actually understand her",2586640,,,,,,,,,,,,

Many of us thought we were crazy for having these kinds of ""pessimistic"" thoughts. She put our thoughts into words making many poor suicidal people that were already suffering extremely . people that were previously made to feel alone , crazy... now could be validated in their thinking and at least felt not so alone not so crazy.

if users didn't like what she was posting they could put her on ignore instead of following her to her threads trying to get her banned. those of us that need more deprogramming from the matrix could then read her posts.

I need deprogramming from the matrix. I think many of us need the deprogramming from the matrix everywhere we constantly see many lies , "" life is good"" we constantly see that lie everywhere directly and indirectly stated.
etc. DNA based life has tortured trillions of sentient beings and billions of humans. but it's praised everywhere all the time.

how many adults even really really understand that they and everyone will die anyway? do they act that way? not imo. no most don't even fully understand they will die , how bad pain can be, how bad old age is 100's more things . And that one truth above all others that we all are going to die is the most fundamental truth ... if most don't even understand that then many are in need of truth. Because many people don't know a lot of truths is why ridiculous illogical things are allowed to happen for example that all adults are denied guaranteed methods of suicide like nembutal, suicide booths, cyanide capsules ( take in case of danger / emergency) , suicide kits , others assisting you in suicide.

of Course Steve Jobs understood That we are all going to die but he was steve jobs. that this has to be a quoted image further shows that imo most adults don't even really understand that:




We are in the matrix . I've only touched on some of the lies in this post or on this forum. in the matrix ""life is good / beautiful / sacred/ important"" .

in reality life has tortured trillions of sentient beings and billions of humans. but it's praised everywhere all the time. life is the only function that causes unbearable pain and suffering and torture in the universe . life is not good

Many people who have views and medical conditions similar to FC have demonstrated that they can put forward their opinions and beliefs without belittling others. So, it is possible. FC sadly became a parody of her own arguments - she lacked compassion (except when people agreed with her); she deliberately wrote provocative posts (based on reading what others on the forum were talking about); she treated others badly.

Everything she hated in humanity and others, she displayed herself. I do not believe she was unaware of any of this. Her interactions demonstrated she knew the impact she was having.

If I am not mistaken, there is technically the possibility to get assisted suicide for mental reasons in the Netherlands and Belgium.

In France, the government wants to make abortion a human right. Why can't suicide be one then? Obviously it would be hard for doctors but the longer the laws are in vigour, the more they will be accepted eventually and all that doctors have to do is to provide you with SN or N and give you some instructions so the patient can take their life on their own.

,2590061,Nikitatos,"Jul 8, 2024 at 8:49 PM","I'm not sure what you mean by ""drugs to ctb"". They don't sell SN on the dark web.

Drug laws vary widely country to country. If you live in a state in the US where marijuana is legal and you're buying small quantities of weed from someone living in that state, your risk is minimal.

If you live in China and you're buying 2 kilos of heroin from Columbia, your risk is bigger.

Each vendor has individual feedback (like Ebay). If some has high feedback rating, it's doubtful you'll get scammed.

It depends on what you're buying, but typically if law enforcement becomes aware of a package in the US mail containing illegal drugs, they simply confiscate the package. If you're buying something like cyanide or something that could be harmful to others, they might take more of interest in you.

If you're buying fentynal from California to get shipped to Montana, it's doubtful anyone would take much of an interest; but I'm sure the penalties could be steep.

Here are the federal penalties for trafficking:

1 year ago my life was going amazing. I had a house with a partner, a little dog, my dream job that I've worked my whole life for.

But slowly, everything has crumbled. My partner turned cold and we broke up, I found out he slept with a friend the day after which he outrightly denied until I found evidence. He then disappeared. I believed I loved him truly, but this shattered my perception of myself, him and the world. I realised he was likely a covert narcissist and could see the emotional abuse I'd experienced throughout the relationship but that I was blind to, because I felt loved and accepted.

But okay, I pulled myself up as best as I could. I got my own place, for the first time in my life I was realising I could be happy single. I could work on my career, earn a decent salary, build a good life for myself.

But then I stopped taking antidepressants. All was going okay until what I believed was protracted withdrawal hit in January. I can't quite put into the words the mental suffering this involved... akathisia, constant unrelenting dread and terror, extreme obsessive and borderline delusional thinking, feeling like my entire body was vibrating. I had to stop working.

But okay, I found advice online and decided to reinstate the antidepressant to manage the withdrawals. Maybe things would be okay, I could get back on track and go to work. But then all hell broke loose, my skin went numb, I experienced extreme brain fog and depersonalisation/derealisation, non-stop head pressure and widespread muscle pain and muscle wastage. My skin went dry and loose. I experienced complete sexual dysfunction - erectile dysfunction, numb and shrunken genitals.

I had no idea what was happening. Until I found out I was previously taking a supplement that can cause post finasteride syndrome, which my symptoms matched exactly. I then found out antidepressants can make this syndrome worse.

So I tried stopping the antidepressants, and the unimaginable terror, akathisia etc. returned.

So I had to reinstate.

I now experience severe anhedonia and emotional blunting. I truly can't feel anything. My physical issues appear to be worsening related to the PFS.

I'm trapped in a position in which taking the antidepressants might make the post finasteride syndrome worse, but stopping them will bring back the protracted withdrawals.

Both of these conditions can be permanent in many cases, and doctors are clueless with both - anything they suggest would most likely make things significantly more worse.

I'm now living at home with my family which I never imagined myself doing ever again. I'm still off work. I don't see how I can ever return to my line of work with the cognitive dysfunction and anhedonia.

The grief of where my life was a year ago to where it is now is unimaginable. I could never have seen myself being in this place in a million years. I've experienced devastating narcissistic abuse, protracted SSRI withdrawal and post finasteride syndrome in the space of 12 months. It's too much to bare.

I feel so, so trapped. Underneath all the suffering, I love life. I found such beauty and meaning in it, such purpose and joy. But I can't experience any of it anymore. I want the suffering to stop, I want my old life back... but I can't. There's time where I accept this, and feel I need to end things. But then I realise although this will make the suffering stop, this will also make any hope of ever experiencing the good things stop as well.

I'm sorry this is a mess, I feel so trapped. I don't want to die, but I don't know how to live like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

,2589463,waterworks,"Jul 8, 2024 at 10:52 AM","Forgive me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like you haven't actually been to doctor about this. I'm not discrediting your research, but seeing a psychiatrist about this (if affordable for you) will help you look at other options. I'm also on antidepressants and withdrawal is known to cause that, I've been through it a few times. A psychiatrist can often prescribe you a ""detox"" medication, something to alleviate the side effects while your body becomes accustomed to living without the antidepressant. Quitting cold turkey ALMOST NEVER works and it can leave you in physical and psychological disarray.

I'm sorry you're going through this. If you don't want to die and really want to get your life back together, please start by seeing a psychiatrist and getting a professional opinion tailored to you specifically. I think you can make it out of this, it's possible to get your life back and you're not a lost cause with this. Wishing you the best.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's the constant back and forth between wanting what I had back, having a sliver of deluded hope this could happen and the harsh reality of what my life currently is. Hard to really move forward in any sense when you're frozen in this place.

Thanks so much for your reply. I've spoken to my doctor and they kinda followed my lead in terms of remaining on the reinstatement and really slowly tapering, which does seem to have helped the withdrawal side of things. If it was just with the withdrawals in isolation I'd feel okay, but it's the fact I'm also experiencing what I believe to PFS that is unfortunately likely permanent with no treatment that I'm really battling with, it's essentially destroyed my mind and body.

Must ship to the states.

In exchange, I am willing to offer the knowledge of sources I have. I will trade ONE of the following for a benzo source:
- active SN sources (2 proven legit, unsure on others)
- AE source clear web
- tele health service for propranolol, meto, and zofran that require nothing more than an online evaluation.

I will trade all of the sources I know for a Xanax source that is in the states.



*Not interested in anything on DNMs. Too complicated for me.
* do not compare your experience to mine and tell me to get it from a doctor. You don't know my life or how impossible that is.

About my addiction to the blade
You told me, ""Those aren't deep.""
I wonder,
What would've been deep enough?
What would convince you of my suffering?
Should the blade cut deep enough so that my skin would refuse to stay together?
Slicing through a layer so that the one below would be exposed?
Would that sight convince you, i wonder,
Or perhaps deeper,
They would never close up on its own and bleed freely,
Leaving what's within me for all to see?
That red flowing through my veins spilling until there is no more left?
Maybe, just maybe,
You were more interested in me etching these wounds into my heart and soul,
Alongside the ones you carved into me.
Where they would neither heal nor rot,
Never to leave
So that even when this body dies, they will stay
Is this your form of love?
Giving me something i could keep beyond the grave?
A pain and suffering that will follow me every step of the way,
Not knowing why or how,
Forever feeling a heaviness in my chest
Is that the point of a mother daughter relationship,
I wonder,
Is this love?

Until it fades away and reveals real darkness
Days no longer greet you smile
Your sun burned out long ago
As you navigate the hazy ashes left behind

Now its a stranger weeping at a grave
You are the tombstone, your mind trapped in a casket underground screaming let me live

Now a door presents itself
Do you step inside and release
Your mind from this pain
Or stand waiting to make a choice..",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Waiting for metoclopramide, propranolol and clonazepam to come",2472640,LunarLight,"Apr 19, 2024 at 1:49 PM","Today I got my SN. I ordered propranolol and metoclopramide from an overseas pharmacy, and clonazepam on the DN.
I could leave today. 30g of SN in 60ml of water (I'm a fat bitch).
But I want to make it peaceful and make sure I won't throw up too much.

My partner suggested to buy vitamins for me, this one especially:

L-Methylfolate as a Monotherapy for Treatment-Resistant Depression
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7572139/ Just learned about it. After a quick research, I noticed it's barely tackled on the forum. It's never been offered as a therapy by any psychiatrist I've seen either. ""after years of searching for an effective treatment and ""doing everything...
sanctioned-suicide.net

But idk, I don't really believe VITAMINS will magically cure me.

The thing is, I lost hope.

Next week my partner is on vacation. We're gonna do stuff we never do, like, go out.
I'm gonna spend my last days with them. I'll try to enjoy them as much as I can.
Even if I'm pathologically unable to enjoy things.

Tonight we ate some burgers in a fast food restaurant and I was crying so much my partner couldn't finish their burger.
They want me alive so bad. Poor baby. I'm so sorry. All I do is dragging them down.
I'm sure they eventually will be better off with someone else. Someone who can enjoy things. Do things. Make them dream. Instead of worrying them so bad.
Sure, it'll take time. But the thing is, they have time. They're 26. The sooner I CTB, the sooner they'll heal. Time makes things only worse.

I'm a trans woman and I hardly pass. People in the streets keep giving me black looks. I'm so sick of it. A man looked me in the eyes for ten seconds when I left the bar and I swear I saw such violence in his eyes I ran for my life.
Nobody takes me seriously, not even so-called ""queer people"". I'm not even a ""man in a dress"": I don't wear dresses, I wish I could, but I'm so afraid of being assaulted. I live in constant fear for my life. And I just look ridiculous. Nobody respects me.
Maybe they're right, after all. Maybe I'm just mentally ill and deserve to die because I've wished I was pretty girl in a dress since I was 6. Maybe that's what I am. A degenerate. Maybe the earth will be better off when I take care of it by myself. No need to put me in a camp. I'll join the 41% club and be laughed at by so many people. ""Was/were"" as they say.
I'd rather be laughed at than cried over. Please don't be sad, baby. I'm not worthy of it. Please move on, find someone else, someone who will make you happy. Because I can't. I simply can't.

I fucking hate my life. It's over.

Hopefully, one last week. Good memories for our last times together. I hope they'll forget them soon enough though, I don't want them to hurt.
I just wish I could disappear, fall into oblivion and be totally forgotten.

I feel like a fucking clown. My life was already hard when I was a man, because depression, anxiety, autism, ADHD, C-PTSD are bitches. But now I'm socially dead.
I remember when I used to sing my songs in a bar in the city I used to live in before. I remember when that obnoxious bald guy, who already had made fun out loud of me and my songs, stood just next to the stage and repeated aloud while I was performing, ""yeah, a chick with a dick, haha"". I finished my song and said, ""I will not sing there anymore"". And part of the audience started booing, screaming slurs at me.
I was offering them the depths of my heart and they were screaming slurs at me.
They took music away from me. My only reason to live.
They want me fucking dead. Fair enough. They've won. They'll certainly get it.
(As I was leaving the bar, obnoxious bald guy provoked me one last time, making fun of my last song. I would have punched them in the face if I was not afraid he would file a complaint against me. So I pushed them and he fell on the ground, screaming my name, taken aback. And I left.
He was banned for six weeks and returned afterwards. The boss, who likes playing the wokest guy when he's promoting his bar, did not tell me his ban was temporary until the day before his ban expired. I never returned.)

Hopefully, it's over next week. I'll drink the magic potion, pop the security pills and pass on the other side.
I'm scared though. I'm scared of the void.
But I shouldn't be scared. I'll return to nothingness. It's like falling asleep. You don't even realize you're falling asleep.
I will just never wake up from this sleep.

""Death is nothing to us. When we exist, death is not; and when death exists, we are not. All sensation and consciousness ends with death and therefore in death there is neither pleasure nor pain.""
Thanks Epicurus for helping me face death.

What a waste. I was so talented. So smart. I could have accomplished so many great things.
We only have one life, and this one is gone to waste because my brain is fucking ill.

This is so fucking wrong.

"Waiting for metoclopramide, propranolol and clonazepam to come",2641772,Iris Blue,"Aug 22, 2024 at 9:20 AM","I'm so sorry you have been going through so much hell. I'm glad you got to do something fun before you plan to go. From what I read I'm not sure if your partner is aware of you wanting to CTB or just knows you've been having a really hard time lately but either way I understand the pain and difficulty. On one hand I'd love to have someone close who I care about be aware of me wanting to end it and support me (to the best of their ability) where they wouldn't want to stop me. But I also couldn't imagine how hard it would be for them to go through that. However, it feels almost worse to keep it all inside without telling anyone and when you get emotional or are hurting so much inside everyone may just think you just are having a hard day when it's so much more than that.

I can't imagine the struggles that you have to go through on a daily basis because of the hate people have for anyone who is different. You should be able to be a trans woman without having to be looking behind your back every second fearing for your own safety just living your life. The way people can be sometimes makes this world not a place worth saving. And it's absolutely awful how they treated you and made you hate something you loved so much and what helped you through bad times. Maybe you and your partner could have at home karaoke nights cause fuck the haters! It made me emotional reading how you were reminiscing on how things were different before. It's unfortunate how it only seemed so much easier when you were someone you didn't feel like was the real you. Although I cannot relate, I also understand looking back at my innocence and naivety when I was younger. And even though I wasn't exactly happy, things seemed so much simpler and still better than they are now.

If you don't mind me asking about the pharmacy, was it fairly easy to order? I've been looking for a while to get some keto and anything else I may need for my SN permanent vacation but a lot of the websites require video calls or a bunch of other things. I'm also worried if I were to order meto if they ship it to my current pharmacy (I'm currently prescribed to seroquel which is a big nono with meto and I'd be afraid the pharmacist would notice the two and refuse to give me it I did go cold turkey on my seroquel a bit over a week ago to be able to take meto without as much of the risks along with a few other reasons). I'm located in the US

All in all, I hope things are going a bit better whenever you are and I truly am sorry for how evil people can be it isn't fair at all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brushing your teeth helps with the dry mouth but not with the feeling of thirst, obviously. It passes, more or less like a sexual urge. Thinking the next two days will be pretty rough.

There were 5 sites in total and there were about 7 THOUSAND predators on just one.

The site was literally called R*pey. What's even more fucked up is that the law enforcement/government completely ignored him. News stations/media companies weren't allowed to report on it. Even legal things they weren't willing to support him and saving children. Brushed it all under the rug. Nobody helped him/did anything until now. Not surprising when pedos/predators are in high positions of power in the govt. who waive these things because either they are evil or are protecting evil friends/family. The owner of the site was a psychotic politician extremist who ran for congress multiple times. That tells you enough of the depiction of society.

I knew there were websites and even more fucked up darker ones on the dark web but the fact that this was on the regular internet and people are aimed at taking THIS website down instead of the twisted disgusting ones harming people is shameful. There are SO MANY predators out there than we think. They are your police, government officials, judges, doctors, attorneys, teachers, random people who walk down the street past you. I'm sick. We live in a truly evil world where people can do whatever the fuck they want with minimal consequences or get away with it all together. This makes me wanna CTB even more. WTF is the point of anything. Especially when there is more wretched twisted cruel evil that even GET SUPPORT. They make up illogical excuses to get the perpetrators dismissed! In one case in one of those catching predators videos, a district attorney dismissed a pedophile that told a child he wanted to shower with her but since they met up in walmart and there is no shower in walmart they dismissed it.................wow what logic and sense despite having a plethora of evidence.

The owner of the site himself quoted and said absolutely horrendous things about children like r*ping them and creating offspring with them etc etc he was not ashamed at all and said it publicly.

LE could have very well been on to them and gathering evidence to build a case that would actually hold up in a court of law.


There probably is plenty wrong with the law. Imperfect humans make imperfect laws and we all live in an imperfect world. There are rules that dictate what evidence can and cannot be used in trials and these rules are meant to protect ALL people's rights, so that people don't end up getting ""rail-roaded"" for crimes they didn't commit. There are certain ""elements"" of a crime that must to be proven, as written in the Constitution, and if the evidence is not there to prove ALL elements of the crime, then the crime cannot be prosecuted, or if it is prosecuted without all elements proven, it results in a ""not guilty"" finding. The US has the best system in the world. It will never be perfect, as people are not perfect. Better to let a guilty man go free than to have even one innocent man imprisoned.

I think you put too much faith in the cops.

Alot of horrible people become cops for that vile reason to have the power and get away with things. Many cops are pedos, abusers, r*pists, predators as well. When school shootings happen, all of a sudden cops forget to be cops.


Like I said what defines a crime in itself is crap. Many things such as vigilantes or killing your abuser, etc etc should be legal and this is what a lot of people think. Even homelessness is illegal. Things like beastiality, pedophilia, child marriage, incest, stealing nude pics etc etc are legal in some states I believe. Don't even get me started on abortion and these prolifers where the rapist has more rights over the female victim alot of times being a impregnated child. Imagine what other things are legal in around the world. There was this one case where in a divorce or breakup the judge ordered for the woman to give the man her nude album.......like wtf is that. Also don't get me started on the sentencing, a person gets 2x the amount of years for marijuana than a rapist/kidnapping etc etc is absolute crap. ALSO the amount of times they let the crimes of richer more powerful people go. Or how if it's a white guy ""Oh we have to think about his future blah blah"" a POC? oh spend most of your life in prison bye bye *hits gavel* White guy shooter? Mental illness. POC shooter? Terrorist

Not too sure about this statement. I would have to disagree. Canada is def better with the whole not shooting kids. So that's a definitely a huge plus I heard some great things about some other countries but I would have to do my research. Also another thing. Prevention. LE will WAIT for a crime to happen, someone to get murdered, stalked, raped, assaulted then take action and alot of times they still don't. If LE/gov focused more on prevention and took complaints seriously so many innocent lives could have been saved.

You make it sound like there are numerous cops who do these things, when in fact the percentage of them wouold be the same as the general population, if that much, which I doubt.

They can only take action based on the law. Yes, everything is after the fact. This goes back to thinking about something is not a crime, nor should it be. LE can only take action against an act of some sort.

No they're not. Stop putting out erroneous information. What is child marriage AS DEFINED BY YOU? Is it any age under the age of 18, which is an arbitrary number assigned as the age of majority. Can some people get married at 17, maybe even 16, yes. Does that make it child marriage? I don't think so. Most cases under the age of 18 require parental consent.

Canada does not have the Constitution the US does. Exactly how many LE personnel do you think there are to investigate the hundreds of thousands of crimes that millions of people commit each year?

It's well known that domestic violence is much higher in law enforcement families, and not just marginally - 2 to 4 times higher. Certain fields of work attract narcissists, sociopaths and psychopaths more than others e.g. Law, Politics, Entertainment, Business/Finance etc. Because these fields provide narcissists with things they crave such as unquestionable authority, power, wealth, status, influence, attention/adulation etc.

And you'd have to be naive to think that these figures aren't under-reported because victims are threatened to keep quiet and because of the brotherhood culture and 'blue wall of silence.' It's widely known by now that police are less likely to be held accountable for excessive violence, rape, and murder, this attracts criminal-minded and violent men to join the force and abuse their power believing that they will be untouchable. David Carrick is a good example of someone who benefitted from this for almost two decades. Wayne Couzens is another example and his nickname amongst colleagues was The Rapist.

Police and courts don't take offenses like stalking, sexual violence, child abuse, child porn, and domestic violence seriously, they wait until it escalates to murder or abduction and then clean up the mess.

The way courts handle crimes related to child porn is laughable. Plenty of cases prove this, the case of the South Korean guy who ran the world's biggest global child porn site is a good example of this, despite distributing over 1 million videos of CP, he was protected form extradition, given a short sentence, and the identities of the creeps who used the site were also protected.",2097515,2097515,2097515,,,,,,,,,,

One vid I saw of the cop, his acting was actually SO GOOD! Like he was calm and believable that he wasn't talking to 11 year olds/sending them d*ck pics. The sad thing was he was married and had a child on the way. Alot of them KNOW how to act and play it off perfectly because they trained better to not get caught than their actual trainings to be a cop LOL.

Even this incident that I posted about I found randomly on youtube and I was just........disgusted and it definitely took a huge mental toll on me.
I absolutely agree! The fact that there are so many males that make pedo and rape jokes is insane and usually lead to them partaking in it or they already have. And so may other males with their ""bro code"" will support/ignore it. The fact that being called/accused a rapist is still more appealing and less degrading than being called a victim of rape is BEYOND socially fucked up. And the fact that males will still make degrading jokes about the victims like ""oh she got her goods taken away"" ""she's not pure anymore"" ""she's damaged goods"" ""no one will want her"" and will LAUGH off the rapist. We live in hell.
I am disgusted.........yeah none of this is new and has been going on since ancient times but I'm glad that atleast now we get some awareness and heavy on the SOME because I looked up Ted gunderson on tor and alot showed up but then looked him up on the regular internet and BARELY anything. The govt is even trying to make us less aware and hide the evil........this is sick.

I doubt it's like alcoholics annonymous! I doubt they go there to fight these thoughts. They go there to indulge in them. To be brutally honest- we probably do the same here but this concerns our lives. We're not here lusting over minors.

Don't you think it's more likely they will get off on one another's fantasies and feel reasured that what they are thinking is 'ok'? Because- hey- lots of other people think like them too. Isn't there a higher likelihood they will get into sharing porn if they start networking with other paedophiles? Paedophile 'rings' and all that? Surely it starts with online chats?

Funnily enough- it is a similar sort of criticism that is levelled at this site. Sanctioned suicide- suicide is ok. Sanctioned paedophilia doesn't sound quite so good!

Don't get me wrong. I actually feel desperately sorry for people who are attracted to children. I know what it's like to fancy the wrong person. I've fallen for married guys before. I expect there are plenty also that would never act on their desires. I have terrific admiration for them. I don't know though- I couldn't see them joining a forum where other blokes delight in describing how they'd like to rape children. I imagine that would be incredibly triggering if you were trying to resist temptation.

Plus- there's evidence in people like Ted Bundy- where- by feeding this desire for sexual violence- it lead to actual violence. Even if they're not consuming porn, they are arousing one another with thoughts of extreme violence against children. I just don't see it as harmless carthasis.

So basically even though you're still breathing just fine, your body can't get enough oxygen to it's cells. It's suffocation at a cellular level. You may get a headache and get dizzy, but you'll feel faint and weak then pass out before you expire. SN is more similar to cyanide in how it works as cyanide messes up the metabolism of cells, but cyanide is extremely painful and not recommended while SN is relatively peaceful and would be the second best method of choice after N in my opinion for peacefulness.
SN is very lethal. According to my research and the accounts I've read, SN will always kill you if you take the right dosage of it even if you do vomit. You'll only survive with timely medical intervention because there's a cure to SN they can administer which essentially reverses the effects of it and it does so very quickly.",2589999,2590037,,,,,,,,,,,

I was the unexpected beneficiary of a very rare, very unexpected self-employment opportunity which I seized ~ 6ish years ago. I always knew it would come to an end, and was also quite cognizant of the fact that I never deserved to receive such a spontaneous, unsought blessing.

It allowed me to enjoy modest financial stability while being able to work full-time on the creative projects which are near and dear to me and truly my ""life's work."" I resolved to spend the time mostly in solitude, trying to make the most of every moment with the ever-present knowledge this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to ""follow my dreams"" could suddenly cease to be, at any time. I didn't know when, but I knew it would inevitably end at some point, and that it would absolutely devastating.

As expected, and due to factors beyond my individual control, this is exactly what came to pass. Nothing lasts forever, and the things that make us happiest are the hardest to lose. I'm immensely grateful for being able to have the experience, though, it means I got to spend the final years of my abbreviated life doing something worthwhile and fulfilling.... almost makes up for all the prior years of frustration and despair.

The pro-lifers' advice to me would be ""go get a regular job now,"" and for some folks, this might be sound advice. However in my case, it was the time spent at those ""regular jobs"" that exacerbated my maladaptive mentality and drove me to self-medicate with illegal drugs.

Critique the Feasibility of My Plan & Offer Me Practical Tips,2590252,wanttogetonthebus,"Jul 9, 2024 at 2:54 AM","I will continue to update this post to change or add more details so that my plan stays up to date. I'm looking to make any necessary tweaks or alterations so that my plan can be successfully carried out. This is just a first draft. I want my plan to be as fool-proof as possible and I won't commit until I feel confident that it will actually work.

My Request
Please critique the feasibility of my plan and offer me any practical tips so that I can be successful. If I missed anything or failed to account for any likely result that will interfere with my plan, please let me know and give me suggestions or advice. This is a first preliminary draft.

My Two Objectives (non-negotiable and not up for debate, don't leave any feedback on these two items)
-CTB successfully
-Body unfound or at least all traces of any recoverable DNA entirely gone by the time I'm found

About Me
I'm a 30 year old sedentary 5 foot 4 inch female. Back in high school, I think it took me about 30 minutes to run a mile and I was dying for air. I weigh 145 pounds and have a 24.89 BMI and body surface area of 1.72. My resting BP is 137/93 and resting pulse is 93. The most exercise I do is walking up a set of stairs about once a day in an air conditioned house and that's it. I don't hike.

The Plan (Give me all of your feedback on this section! Tell me everything that can possibly go wrong! I need a second pair or more of eyes to see any flaws or oversights in the feasibility, practicality, and likelihood of success for my plan! Also let me know if I made an errors.)
1. Find a secluded hiking trail with a lot of off-trail wilderness to wander away into.

2. Buy a new phone and/or a new phone plan so that my phone will not be connected to my family's phone plan and won't be traceable by them. Buy a hiking backpack, a tent, and containers of water to hike with along with separate containers of water for use with my SN as a backup. I'll also bring along carb rich energy or granola bars, electrolyte powder, and 6 plastic cups to mix my SN so I have more cups to easily drink the SN concoction from in case I vomit. I should not carry more than 29 pounds on my back when hiking according to my research. The weight of my 4 bottles of N and stash of SN is 5.6 pounds, so the weight of water and other materials I carry can not be more than 23.4 pounds. The North Face Stormbreak 1 tent weighs 6 ounces (.375 pounds). I'm going to assume my backpack weighs 3 pounds and the cups weigh 12 ounces in total. 4.2 pounds is the weight of all of these materials so I can carry 19.2 pounds of water. It takes an estimated 2.3 pounds of water to hike for one hour in my area, so I could hike for an estimated 8.3 hours or longer if there is water to drink on the trail. I did not factor in the weight of high calorie light snacks like granola and energy bars which I also plan to take or factor in the weight of a flashlight or water filtration device in case there's water on my trail of choice. I could use my smart phone as a flashlight and carry a light charging brick in my pocket. Because I am taking SN as a backup to my N, I feel like it is highly unlikely that both will fail and I will need to bring any kind of testing kit but your feedback on this point would be appreciated. I'll probably bring along dramamine as an antiemetic too since it's available over the counter, but I really wish I could have gotten metoclopramide without arousing any suspicion. I'm just not sure how I'd do that and if someone can just show up to a doctor and be like, ""Can I get prescribed metoclopramide?"" Anyway, thoughts on this antiemetic issue too would be appreciated. I also have 3 year old hydroxyzine tablets which is an antihistamine often prescribed as needed to treat anxiety and sleep conditions. I hear antihistamines are closely related to antiemetics. Would taking this too help I wonder? Any thoughts or guesses?

3. Schedule an email to be sent to my family for a week in the future past my estimated time of death that says that I'm an adult and I've decided to move on with my life in a new way and not to go looking for me because I want to keep my independence because I haven't gotten anywhere in life tied down to them [so that nobody tries searching for my body and they don't have a strong basis to file a missing persons report]. I could also send my rage-filled CTB note. What do you think would be best to send to prevent people searching for me? Maybe if I make it clear dead rather than appear like I possibly could be missing then recovering the body people are more likely to leave it alone? Thoughts? Finally, send a thank you message to my one friend lying and telling them I'm about to go under for an emergency surgery and that I need them to know I truly appreciate them because I got help too late. [I'm scared that this last one might not be believable enough...? How can I have a good excuse to never see my friend again (so they don't feel abandoned) while making it clear I'm eternally grateful for everything over the many years? They invested a lot in enriching my life and I want to show them the gratitude they rightfully deserve. But, to prevent interference, nobody can know what I'm actually going to do.]

3. Before the day of the hike comes, I'll check that every piece of gear is in working order. I'll have some printed out copies of critical instructions I type out in case my phone fails and I need to review my plan. I have the PPH handbook installed on my phone and have skimmed it time and time again lot over the years, but I'll make sure I thoroughly review the relevant sections again in detail. I'll say my goodbyes to Sanctioned Suicide, transfer all savings to checking, and set up a recurring donation with my favorite charity that will hopefully drain my checking account dry over time to a good cause, but I will still be able to have money in my checking in the event I need to make some emergency purchase because of some kind of plan interference. Anyway, will this work or will there need to be some kind of recurring authorization with my bank to continue to have the monthly donations withdrawn? My checking and savings account are independent and mine alone but I have the same last name as my family. The last thing I'd want other than failing CBT, is for them to get their hands on the money I earned! It should go to things I supported and cared about in life!

4. Get an Uber or Lyft to take me to the site I'll hike from. As soon as I get out of the vehicle, remove the SIM card from my phone and crush it or at least toss it in the wilderness where it won't be found. Hike as far as I can until I mostly run out of the main supply of water or am in the middle of the trail - in either case I need to be in isolation and difficult to find as far out of view and hidden as possible. Hike away from the trail and pitch my tent with some paper and tape on the front (which I'll also need to take) that says I'm sleeping and not to disturb me. Get inside the tent and get to business. Measure my SN into the cups with a small gram scale I'll also need to take. Stack the cups and place them next to me. Now, the SN is plan B, but I'm doing all the prep work for it ahead of time besides actually pouring the water and mixing, because if I fail plan A, I might barely be conscious or coherent for plan B. Plan A is to chug as quickly as possible all 4 bottles of N. If somehow I wake up still alive (and I pray in this case that I haven't been discovered), then I can rest for a while and if I still have the strength prepare my SN. Back to plan A for a second, I'm thinking that since I have 4 bottles of N and 1 is usually enough to be lethal maybe I could use 1 or 2 of them for an N-ema which is an alternate route of administration I've heard about that might be helpful should I vomit. In that case, I'd have to bring additional N-ema gear. Ideally though, I wish I had medical training so I could administer the N through an IV but oh well. Step 4 should end with successful CTB!

5. I'll be absolutely pissed if I get respawned... because how did I even end up here in the first place? I just opened my eyes and suddenly I was alive and existing like black magic ;o; This is my biggest and most worrisome of philosophical gripes and I honestly pray what we call life really isn't some kind of inescapable cycle. This worry is one of the things that has kept me alive until now for fear of the possibility of repeating my hell eternally. But I also realize that staying alive isn't going to make things better for me either under my circumstances without so much of the world drastically changing just for me which it won't, and at the end of the day, there's a reason I haven't been able to hold my head up for 30 years or even come to accept my pitiful existence. I'm hardly better off now than I was in late elementary school and have nearly the same amount of independence as I did back then but now with a lot less potential (washed up and tired of the grind) and less margin for error (because I'm supposed to be a responsible adult who likes to toil for my bread). It's all so horribly unfair as life often is and I hope this will be my last and final challenge. No matter what I'm going to die as are we all, and I think it's about time for me to take a stand and say enough is enough and that I don't have a desire to play this game we're all playing anymore. I've always been of the belief that participation in games should be by choice and games are meant to be fun and worthwhile to each individual who chooses to play.

My Questions
1. Will the electrolyte powder, water drinking, or eating the snacks I bring along negatively affect the potency and effectiveness of my N and SN?

2. Will dramamine negatively affect the potency and effectiveness of my N and SN? I know metoclopramide is used frequently with SN and works well, but I haven't heard any first hand accounts of dramamine even though it is mentioned as a potential alternative antiemetic for CTB in general. I think my mom once said when I was a baby or toddler that dramamine or benadryl made me hyper, but she says a lot of things that never happened and she's hardly observant so I'd take that with a grain of SN. Speaking of Benadryl, as an antihistmaine, I wonder if that could be helpful here. I think I had a friend who said it would knock him out. Anyway, all of these drugs I have access to (dramamine, benadryl, hydroxyzine) are antihistamines which I think are supposed to be central nervous system (CNS) depressants and metoclopramide is also a CNS depressant. N is a crazy powerful CNS depressant easily lethal and alcohol is also a CNS depressant that can be consumed to further potentiate the effects of N according to the PPH handbook. I'm under the impression that in general all CNS depressants magnify or stack on top of each other and none of them seem to act as a direct counter to the others. Interestingly enough, N actually has a protective effect against the damaging effects of SN though according to what I've read. SN is not a CNS depressant though.

3. Could taking my 3 year old hydroxyzine either separately or in addition to dramimine be effective with N and SN? Does anyone know or have any guesses. I have not studied chemistry or medicine.

Thank You For Everything
I tried to spare you too much sentiment or pity partying in this post because I'm actually here to do business, but I apologize for ranting a bit at the end. Once I'm fully committed to my plan, however, I might make a final thread on here with the CTB note which I may not even leave for anyone to find outside of this website because the less people know about what I did and how I did it, the better for us all. This is my decision and mine alone and I don't want any interference.
I've been wanting this for a very long time and I'm ready and not afraid to go. Now, it just might be the time and I've done many years of thinking and it's this forum that stopped me from meeting a messy end or permanently injuring myself so I'm very grateful that you allowed me this extra time to really be ready emotionally and to go out there and live my life the best that I could have given my circumstances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I too have expired antiemetics that I have no idea about the efficacy, just crossing my fingers.
I wholeheartedly agree with what you wrote in the above bit, about being here for business & that this forum helps prevent dumb mistakes in the process. I didn't know SN existed…And the bit at the top about wanting to be successful & not want anyone talking me out of it.
I have zero advice to offer which I'm sorry about. Oh actually, I just thought - the advice with the AE that I got (don't know if yours are tablets) but to pop one out & check the condition of it, that it's not crumbly or smelly etc & to take 1 as a trial run, which I did - the pill proclerazapine (I don't remember how to spell it) looked fine & I took one & zero side effects which was partly a relief but also mostly worrying that they weren't effective anymore…

So first my drinking history, I have been on and off drinking for the last few years, sometimes for a few days every day, and what is confusing is that what Im about to explain has never happend to me before.
About drinking and hangover, since Im light weight and a female, I get tipsy easily, I only need half a bottle to a bottle of wine, and with that I get light hangover with diarrhea and all that lasts about 8-12h at most (keep that in mind)

So for the last few days, about 5, I have been drinking half a bottle to a bottle every day, with typical hangover the next morning.
Today I decided not to drink. I got a normal hangover and some anxiety, but after that 8-12h I still felt bad, like imma get a fever but I didnt have it. Now is the end of the day, and normally by now I should not feel anything but I still feel bad.
I have to mention I only drank about a little less than half a bottle last night, wasnt tipsy as much, so not much to feel that bad all day.

Could this be just normal hangover or something else?

How to Come Back from Dissociation,2587815,dazed.daydreamer,"Jul 7, 2024 at 12:03 AM","Hello,
I've felt heavily detached from my own life for a long time. It's not a super intense, episodic sensation—I don't feel like I'm out of my body or anything like that. It's more like I don't feel quite like a real person. I genuinely forget that I can make decisions and initiate things myself. It feels like I just follow along with the bare minimum of what's expected of me. Other than that, I mostly rot alone in my room, and don't feel motivated to do much else. The anhedonia, lethargy, and complete lack of motivation may ebb and flow over time depending on how depressed I am, but this is generally the way I've been for years now. I feel largely detached from my own emotions—not that they were never there, but more like they are heavily muffled most of the time, if that makes sense. I'm guessing this developed subconsciously as a coping mechanism while I was dealing with depression and other issues as a kid that I felt out of control of, felt weak for/ashamed of, and didn't want to bother anyone about. I would guess this started about 10 years ago, though not as severe at that time.
Despite being frustrating (and probably being a large barrier to any chance of me recovering), I guess it is effective in that it's probably the main thing that's prevented me from killing myself over the years. I don't want to live, and logically thinking through it, it makes more sense for me to CTB. But I'm so spaced out and exhausted that I usually don't have it in me to do anything about it. I am logically(?) suicidal, but the emotional force behind it is usually heavily subdued, if not entirely muted. This doesn't translate to me being functional though— at this point I mostly just bedrot, get food, sometimes do bare-minimum stuff for school/work/social expectations (if even that). I'm already not living at this point, my body is just surviving, which requires a bunch of resources from other people to maintain. It's a waste and there's no reason to keep doing it, no one is getting anything out of this, it's just prolonging the inevitable.
I guess I'm asking if this is relatable for anyone, and if anyone has advice for coming back into myself enough to truly *feel* the weight of my situation, most likely so I can finally CTB. I think writing my note may help, it did a while ago during an episode where I very nearly went through with suicide (I regret not doing so at that time)",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've tried some of this (not the substances/meds or festivals/events though) when I'm able to (aka not in a depressive episode, I have MDD). It helps for a bit, but I always seem to end up back where I started at some point, a few weeks or months later. It's just exhausting, feels unsustainable (especially after college, which I'd finish in the spring), and I've lost hope that I can work towards a substantial recovery through the methods available to me.

Being in school rn is a big deal... Props. I have mdd too. I couldn't do it... I don't know if you have plans or have thought about after college but starting to shop around ideas and plans might be helpful. I can't do anything without a clear, detailed plan. Maybe you take a break if you can afford to and work on yourself. Maybe you look for more schooling or what you can apply for. I don't know your life or situation, so I don't know what's available for you. Maybe take a road trip by yourself or with a friend or family member.

My current rough plan is grad school for school psych (or counseling psych). The idea was to help adolescents dealing with mental health issues both individually and though communal interventions in an accessible way, ideally not in an overly medicalized way or paywalled. I'm passionate about this, but I feel too unstable and dysfunctional to get through grad school or hold down a job, especially one that requires a certain vulnerability. I can't convince anyone else to keep going and improve themselves if I can't do the same.
I am fortunately in a place where I could take time off if I wanted to; my family could financially support me, and I think they are kind and understanding enough of mental health to do so. But idk if it would help. I just feel that my failures and dysfunctionality are inherent parts of me at this point, rather than a transient issue that can be fixed.",2590065,,,,,,,,,,,,
How to Come Back from Dissociation,2590236,sancta-simplicitas,"Jul 9, 2024 at 2:28 AM","I definitely relate. You seem to be stuck in a parasympathetic overactivation aka the ""freeze response"". It's a similar bodily process to when opossums are playing dead in front of a threat. In fact, you can actually die from it, but it's very, very rare and usually happens to only some people in extreme circumstances. Look up ""psychogenic death"". I was in that state for years, and when you are it is usually for a very good reason. You are likely so overwhelmed by something that your body is working overtime to numb you from it. What eventually helped me getting out of it was sympathetic activation; ""fight or flight"". I was put in a situation where I was essentially forced to relive my most traumatic memories and for some reason that ""woke me up"". I wouldn't recommend that method because it obviously comes with its own set of issues. But there are other ways to get that adrenaline flowing and that heart pumping. Some people use exercise, which seems counterintuitive when you're lethargic, but that's - unfortunately - sort of the point. Do the opposite of what your body is trying to do. Cold water, spicy and/or sour foods, holding ice or just inflicting pain in some way are other methods I've seen. Personally, I've had a lot of success with something called TTT - Trauma Tapping Technique - too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

trans rant,2581802,ToastInTheShell,"Jul 1, 2024 at 7:25 PM","I have no reason to feel this way. My body is so unfeminine and gross transitioning is nowhere near plausible. If I do, I'll be hated by the world for the rest of my life. All I hear from friends, family and even the fucking media is how trans people only make people uncomfortable, and end up living shitty lives.

I will never find love. I won't have any friends. I won't be able to find a job. Fucking EXISITING won't be possible if I transition. But then what's left if I don't? Feeling like THIS every day until I die? Every day I fantasize about cutting or killing myself, and the only times it's gone away is when I feel remotely feminine in literally any way. It doesn't matter if I'm shaving my body hair, wearing feminine clothes, or even if someone's just trying to emasculate me, that's the only time it stops. But the comfort I feel is always so fleeting, and when the reality of my biology sets back in it just all comes flooding back.

Then people try to tell me I've manufactured this. Or that this is just some weird fucking fetish or mental illness, and sometimes I think I'm starting to believe them. I just know I don't want this. I don't enjoy hating myself or spending every second of every day wishing I was someone else. I hate all of it. I hate the envy I feel every day when I see cis women. I hate developing feelings for guys who will never and CAN NEVER love me back. I hate seeing trans pride online, how are you proud of feeling fucking miserable and disgusted by your body every single day?

I can either transition, lose all my family and friends, be slightly less disgusted by my body (though still definitely wrought with self hatred) and just more at risk of being laughed at or beaten in the fucking street OR I can cut to the chase and die unhappy tomorrow. Despite the latter OBVIOUSLY being the better option I just can't bring myself to do it. I've tried to OD with but I got caught by my parents. I tried hanging twice; the first time I fucked it up and was shaking and crying too much to do it again and the second time I was just too weak to take the last step.

Despite knowing I will never actually be happy, I can't bring myself to leave. I think I'm still scared of dying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm on summer break now (I'm a teacher so I get time off with my students), and I'm literally going insane, with nothing to distract me I just have to sit and think all day. I can't be bothered to hang out with anyone and most of my friends are abroad right now anyways, I live with my boyfriend but he's pretty much busy 24/7.

usually I would try and use this time to engage in some of my hobbies but literally nothing is enjoyable to me anymore. i have no interest in anything, to the point where it's painful. i always felt like when others were developing their personality i was being brainwashed, now that i've grown up and everyone else has their ""interests"" and i have nothing, it's very alienating.

i don't enjoy anything, no movies, tv shows, games. even the hobbies that i used to have feel more like chores then anything, like i'm just doing them to prove that i'm still a person. i genuinely don't feel like a person anymore. i feel like i have nothing that i can point to as being ""my personality"". i feel more like an empty shell of a person pretending to like stuff that other people like so they will like me too.

no interest in anything,2583719,card1nal,"Jul 3, 2024 at 9:12 AM","I'm so sorry that you are struggling to find interest in things! I've experienced periods of this and it is so fucking agonizing. Anhedonia is one of the more unbearable symptoms of depression and was one of my biggest reasons for wanting to ctb during my worst depressive/post-psychotic episode. Do you have access to a healthcare provider who could prescribe you any type of antidepressant? When I was experiencing bad anhedonia, I sort of just waited it out, but I'm sure antidepressants would be an effective way to tackle it.

If medication isn't an option or you just don't want to, then I'd say you sort of just have to wait it out (like I did). No saying how long it could take to move past it, unfortunately! It could help to do a dopamine detox, which is also something I've tried. Essentially, limit or cut out dopamine-overloading activities like social media scrolling or video games and replace them with more healthy activities like going on walks, reading, or engaging in a hobby. The point of it is to push through the urge to stop what you're doing and going to something easier but less rewarding, like scrolling. I know it probably sounds stupid (I thought it was), and there is still a chance it may not work for you, but just a suggestion!

Also, sorry for the long post, but another thing I found helpful was writing. Doesn't have to be anything in particular. It's just a nice way to engage your brain in something, and it can sometimes give insights into how you're thinking and feeling when it can be hard to unravel everything in your head. I usually spend at least an hour writing, whether that be in a journal, writing a letter to a friend, working on a story, doing research and writing up papers, etc.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

i should really go back on antidepressants, i went off them because i felt normal again (but clearly that was a mistake haha), it wasn't very smart of me to stop taking the medication because it was working. i think a combination of anti depressants and waiting it out might work.

i'm in a place in my life where i know i'm supposed to take it easy and relax, because i won't have so much free time on my hands, but i'm incapable of doing that i guess. i think i just need to wait it out, summer won't last forever and i can go back to work. i definitely should stop being on my phone all the time, i think that's a really good suggestion!! i have to force myself to do that i think.

I'm going through a rough bout of depression right now and the lack of motivation + anhedonia combo is killing me, so I totally feel you. I'm struggling to drag myself to work, and I'm keeping all of the things I enjoy as close as possible (moving my record player closer to my bed, making sure my easel is nearby with all of my paint setup, my guitar, amp and heaphones all nearby and plugged in) so that I don't have to do as much work when that slight motivation hits.

If you do have anything you know you /do/ actually enjoy, even if small, something that helps for me is to say you'll give it five minutes. If it's a movie, say ""I'll just turn it on for the first five minutes, I can turn it off after,"" and usually five minutes turns into ten, ten turns into the whole movie.

Strategies to LESSER FAMILLY SUFERRING after CTB (My Plan),2519426,final_countdown12,"May 14, 2024 at 10:23 AM","Ok i know its imposible to completely ease their suferring. CTB will probably traumatize parents for longterm if not forever.

Nonetheless i want to share my checklist of things ive done to help them mitigate the impact after my departure. Please share if you have any other idea that i might be missing.

Unfortunately its not easy task. It takes time, energy so its not easy task, specially considering we are already fucked up with depression or any other mental/physical/financial problem.

I took months to organize and make this checklist 100% ready. But it was the only way i found to make peace with my death and be ready to CTB. If you have resources, energy and consideration to your family its worth the effort.

1) write a handwriten clear concise and objective letter to the police/coloner + a letter to the family. Put your reasons and state that its not your family fault and there is nothing that could be done to change your decision. Also make it clear that CTB is your own responsabilty and nobody else assisted you and you are in peace with that decicion to CTB.
A letter to the police could somehow help (there is controversy) but you want the investigation to be concluded asap and smoothly after you CTB. No one whants big police interrogatory to your family members, so make your CTB something clear and with all evidences exposed.

Find bellow the best tutorial of how to write an effective and objective Suicide letter to family:

HOW TO WRITE A SUICIDE NOTE

2) choose the correct location for your CTB, you can greatly reduce family trauma if you choose to die in a neutral place such as chain hotel room and not in family house. Your family wont have to clean the mess, they wont be the first one to find the body and their house wont be remembered of this tragic event. On the other hand Chain hotel room has professional and protocols regarding deaths, here you can find an example bellow:

https://hospitalitylawyer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Responding-to-guest-deaths.pdf

Of couse, put a big sign in the entrance of bed/bathroom so you avoid the house keeping to see your corpse and he/she just directly call police and he/she wont be traumatise.

After police/ambulance in called and your body is removed to local mortage, your family will be contacted by the mortage of by the police itself.

3) previouly scheduled money transfer to your family account. And/ Or make a will.

4) make prepaid funeral arrengements and give the concierge funeral' contact and contract # to your family. Having a funeral already organised will be very helpfull for them. Remember: funeral is for your family/friends to make a closure and help acelerate the grieving process, so its an important natural process. The funeral is NOT for you, since you will be gone. So at least let them decide regarding funeral event.

5) organize clothes for your funeral or cremation and make them already cleaned and organized

6) Close all your accounts specially bank account before CTB : you dont want to make your old mom having to deal with all hassle. In case is not posible to close a specifx account, just fill up the forms in advance and organize the documents to your family leaving detailed instruction on how to proceed after your death (leave detailed instructions, e.g. ""contact this person phone number Xxxxxx and send him this document X and Y"".

7) donate all your bellonings, you dont want your old mom dealing with loads of your personal clothes and other stuffs

8) Program gmail and facebook/instagram ""heritage feature"" and autorize your family, so your family can handle all your social media account after your death

9) delete everything ""nasty"" you want in your mobile and then use the app SECURE ERASE. But dont delete everything or it will look too suspicious to police and family. Just leave trivials messages and apps availabe. The rest you delete.

10) choose a strategic date to CTB;
Best dates to lesser parents suferring:
A) date of your birth = date of your CTB, in this case they will have just 1 date/ per year of grieving (instead of 2)
B) dont CTB close to any relative birthday date
C) dont CTB in any major holiday date
D) make sure they will be home when they get the CTB news. E.g.; dont CTB during their anual vacation trip

11) Write a living Will (in german is called Patientenverfügung).
Basicaly its a simple document that says ""in case i go in a coma state, please turn off the machines as i dont want to live as a vegetable"".
I just printed yesterday and signed this doc. im going to put this document beside my corpse in case im found alive.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It was fortunate I knew their mobile phone passcode as that gave me access to their emails and from there I could sort out the estate.

I'd say my list, which I already have in place:
1) Don't use a photo or fingerprint for your phone entry, make it a passcode and write it down
2) Create a password notebook for everything you're signed up to. You don't need to close the important accounts if there's the login details. Electricity, TV licence etc.
3) Anything you've pre-paid for can usually be refunded, write this in the notebook
4) You don't need to pre-pay the funeral, just make sure you've got the money available to cover the costs. You can get a basic funeral without an event, your ashes are put in a communal garden and there's no one present. It's the cheapest option of around £1500
5) Make a will - without a will there's additional solicitor fees - even if you've got nothing to leave, make a will for around £100. It'll save a few thousand in solicitor fees. If there's no will then the solicitor needs to look into prior rights etc - additional costs for your family
6) Don't leave debts - you don't want your family to have to pay anything after you're gone. Most debts don't die with you.
7) Don't give any indication on social media (Facebook) that you're feeling down or anything. You'll end up getting visits from friends / family / neighbours. Act normal
8) Work doesn't matter, they will find a replacement, don't worry about them. Just make sure anything personal you've deleted from your works computer
9) This is the hard part, which I've not worked out yet, plan it out so it doesn't fail. Don't attempt anything till you know it's definitely going to work. You don't want to be a burden on your family, or worse, in a position that you can't re-try again because people are watching over you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Prepaid funeral just avoid all haslle regarding filling up forms, sending documents, choosing cofffim , choosing flowers and many others operational details that your mother wont be in mental condition to perform after you CTB. Thats why its much easier to make everything prepared before.

In my country (South america), there are clear civil law codes regarding this: debts cannot be passed/inherited to your parents in case you dont have any asset and in case your parents didnt signed any co-participation in your debt contract. Also make sure your spose/wife didnt signed any co-participation debt contract with you as well.

Thats my case, i dont have any asset nor heirs (kids) nor wife therefore my debts will die with me. Also my parents does not have any co-participation in any of my debts so they cannot be affected.

of course, if you have asset or in case any of your parents signed a co-participation in the debt contract with you, then the debt will be passed to them.
Good advice. I already set this configurarion in my cel phone just fearing that Cops could login my mobile and try to get the little money i scheduled to be transfered to my mother

Also I sent an scheduled email to my brother and i put the pin password of my mobile in case he eventually need it in case the police investigation is somehow extended. But i begged him that in case its not needed just donate or put my mobile in the garbage.",2519759,2519759,2519759,,,,,,,,,,

They do a basic plan, I discussed this with them after my partner and they gave me details. I've got this in my will and discussed with family. The thing is doing it this way is because prices change, even pre-paying can lead to additional costs whereas if you allocate money then that gives them a ballpark to work with. Either way, there's forms to fill in.

In the UK certain debts are passed on to spouse, like credit cards. I'm not sure of which debts go onto a family but I know mortgage does to the inheritor. In my case my mortgage is paid up so that's not an issue. It's just be aware of what passes on, do your research beforehand.

I think the main thing is trying as much as you can to make it easy for whoever has to deal with it afterwards. One thing that I forgot that's VERY important, is try to do it in your own country. Outside of the country it can add a lot of time to the repatriation and also cost a lot more in repatriation costs. It also means whomever deals with your estate has to travel to the country to sign the paperwork etc - not great for them and much more stressful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

My prepaid funeral is a private one in the mid/upper level range so there is no space to extra charge and also all my family has to do is call the concierge. 99% of the complicated forms are all filled up and all documents sent (including my mothers').
thats definetely something very boring to do but its better to do in advance. Its extremelly stresfull. Cant imagine my old mom trying to figure out all those stresfull forms and decisions (coffins, flowers, location of cremation, clothes etc).
It make senses if the spose/wife have coparticipation and a a joint bank accout. Then the debts will surelly be passed infortunately.

in my case, there is no legal possibility to pass my credit card bills to my mother/father/brother since they dont have any joint/co-participation in any of my account. nonetheless i prepared a full email with all instructions and law codes to provide my brother with all legal information, just in case. If my bank or any debt collector charge any of my family member, that would be harassing/abuse and the bank can be sued. I instructed my brother to sue the bank in case this abuse/harrassment eventualy occur.
You are correct that an important topic. Thats the main reason i decide to bring all N back to my country with me and also the reason ill CTB in a hotel in the same city of my parents just to facilitate and speed up all police investigation and death protocol logistics. The process should be fast, effective, easy/simple and transparent to all involved in order to eliminate the possible hasslle to the family coming from the police.",2519867,2519867,2519867,,,,,,,,,,

Getting into that university was the only good thing I had in my life last year. Last year was the worst year of my life so many things went wrong for me throughout the entire year. When I got into that university I finally felt happy again because it was helping me move on from all the pain I suffered throughout the year and finally my life was getting back on track.

At the last minute I was told the University had a rule which is to start the course a person has to pay £5,000 enrolment fee upfront I was forced to defer my place. Postgraduate system is different compared to undergraduate in the UK different universities have different rules on fess. My student loan I was given was not enough to cover the costs

The most painful thing was my mum was almost crying and trying to figure out a plan how to find the money because there was NO relative she could call for help because that's how selfish my relatives are. My grandmother and mother always help these relatives with whatever problem they have. My mum and grandmother always send money to relatives who need help and help with anything they need but the time I really needed help NONE of these relatives were there to be seen. All those years of helping people in the family and all they ever do is abandon us.

My grandmother paid her brother to go to university in the UK. Her brother became rich and total snob who looks down upon everyone in the family. He shows off how rich he is its fucking disgusting. If anyone asks him for help he will not help.

I don't even know anymore if I will be starting university because I am having problems getting a government student loan. I already spoke to the Student Finance England they explained even though my student loan from last year was cancelled my university didn't give them the correct paper work. I have given advice on what to do but still it's not guaranteed to work.

If I get told I can't take up my university place this year I will kill myself mentally being forced to defer a year has already broken me. Throughout the year I tried getting getting jobs to but employers constantly reject me. I am already consumed with bitterness. I hate my relatives so much especially my rich uncle who had the power to help.

I made it thru and finished thinking the doors to life would open up for me. That if you worked hard, sacrificed, did without.....that things now should be good & work out for you.
Almost immediately afterwards though, I found out this is not the case. The world is not fair or just.....the world rewards nepotism, favoritism, cheaters, bias etc.
I had to see it first hand happening to not only myself but to others as well. Its depressing to see it happening while you are in it....and I knew after awhile that all that work, I wasn't going to get much in return. I got married thinking I could at least be normal like everyone else....it lasted for 5 years, only to have them leave for someone else. Then in a 2nd marriage to have that person cheat as well.

The Student Finance and university messed up my masters degree funding applications due to constant disorganisation. Its not looking good.

Getting into that university was the ONLY good thing i had in my life. I am going to lose everything. I have invested so much into this

Last year was the worst year of my life everything throughout the year constantly kept going wrong for me starting from New Years Day. First I was stuck in a foreign country being forced to see selfish toxic user relatives who don't care me and just use everybody. I loved the pandemic because it was pure peace never seeing these people anymore. In my family's culture ( African) family is an enormous deal. My relatives get away with everything because the family weaponsies Christian forgiveness.

My dead grandfather was the only relative who cared about me and only person worth seeing in my parents home country. Being in my parents home country was the worst because everything in the country reminded me of him. I have been struggling to deal with the grief, he died 4 years ago during the pandemic. Since my teens I have hated family gatherings aboard and its impossible to get out of.

All I was looking forward too was going home and while the plane in mid air my flight got cancelled due to damage being detected in the plane.

I feel deeply in love with a 55 year old male work colleague he made me feel so special in a way no man has ever done. All my life guys my own age ignored me and treated me awfully it felt great having a man finally see me and be attentive to my needs. He constantly kept playing mind games with lying, two faced behaviour and mind games. When I was ready to move on from him after discovering he has been dishonest with me about his complex relationship status he began to change towards me and sabotaging me at work.

Long story short He humiliated me, he painted me to be an immature young woman besotted with an older man and our boss believed his lies over me. I was humiliated at work along and he was helped with the assistance of an older woman at work who I thought was my friend, she and him were gossiping about me.

I was struggling already in my job, I got a reputation for being a rebellious young woman because I honestly called out an entilted arsehole customer behaviour and refuse to put up with their behaviour. I was quite harsh in my honesty. The management at work constantly gave me a hard time over it this led to me getting fired for having poor customer service skills. My boss blamed me ""bringing problems"" and said how I bring ""nothing to his team"". My boss cruelly mocked my immaturity and threw insults about how immature I am.

I took responsibility for my mistakes and geniuenely wanted to be a good employee. .

This job was my first ever full time job since graduating university. I never got to show what I was good at I was known as that colleague who messed up all the time . I was the youngest in the department me being 25 and I am outspoken compared to my colleagues who were older and quiet. I struggled to fit in. I was nice to everyone at work even sending Christmas cards to the department and our boss and nobody said thank you.

My eating disorder got discovered by family after my mum opened my parcels discovering my diet pills. My grandmother confiscated all my laxatives and diet pills which cost me over £30. So many things in the year kept going wrong for me.

I love that man so much, i feel like this heartbreak will never go away, I feel like I will never meet another man like him who noticed me and showed me attention the way he did . All my life I have had the confidence to talk to guys my age i actually liked and showed genuine interest in the things they like but still none of them ever wanted to know me. All I ever been is that girl now woman who never gets picked, its been confidence damaging.

Guys my own age can't see infront of them woman who genuinely wants to be them, the woman who genuinely appreciates aspects of their personality instead just chase another a woman. I have never been a man's number 1 choice.

I didn't care he had grey hairs and when he came to work with 4 front teeth missing I was still attracted to him. He knew my true feelings and he constantly kept playing mind games and just lying. He messed me up so badly. I still love him

I remember the good times before it went wrong.

I have gone through so much choas last year I have lost the ability to look forward to anything because whenever I looked forward to anything last year at the last minute it got taken away. I had so much bad luck last year sometimes I can't believe it happened to me. The situations I found myself where so messed up at one point I thought I was imaging things because I couldn't believe the bullshit.

NEVER in my life i have had that amount of bad luck now I am superstitious because of everything that happened to me. I never used to believe in bad luck",2590086,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Devil,2590107,waterworks,"Jul 8, 2024 at 10:06 PM","Imagine there were an afterlife. In that afterlife not too far away, where doubt dissolves in the certainty of facing the foundation of reality, the source of all. You come there full of scars and wounds from a life that got the better of you; or maybe of one that came short of the spark needed to ignite your desire for it. In this aura of belonging and peace, the only thing this source has to say to you is ""begone from here you sinner"".

Okay, religion is cancer. I've been thinking about the devil. How none of the narrative I've had shoved down my throat even remotely seems rational, and is full of obvious bias. What makes the devil? I think in one word, ignorance. In 2019 the movie ""Joker"" came out and when it did, oh boy, the media frenzy it sparked was like the first time violent video games became mainstream. The vocal critics called it a glorification of violence. I think at the root of it, is the fear of the realization that the devil, if there is one, may be more relatable that any other mythological figure. No one knows what it's like to ""live like christ"" and they delude themselves into believing this perfection is attainable, until they tire of combining a million words into spicy new prayers each night and create repetitive mantras. All in the quest to feel like they aren't all that bad.

I've been thinking about this because I suppose it is possible my journey for peace will lead me to one of the million hells that innumerable religions have taught about. The more I look into this the more I realize the devil represents the dejected things. Beyond the mindless atrocities that are attributed to it, it ultimately stands as a representation of the human psyche. They are the embodiment of a reality that is outside the determined narrative, yet fights so desperately to be heard.

The Joker captures this by showing that ""evil"" is born from an oppressive ""good""; a good that becomes so self absorbed that it cannot understand what doesn't fall into its patterns. Why do we never hear the devil talk? Because we do, only we call it common sense more often than not. It's realizing that torturing a living being in unspeakable horror is not an expression of love; that's common sense, but it's also to some, the devil's work. Maybe that work is what's worth evangelizing.

Cherry pits contain trace amounts of cyanide. While accidentally eating a few cherry pits will not kill you, eating more than 20-30 can lead to dangerous toxicity. Your body can withstand up to 50 mg of cyanide before it becomes poisonous.

If you do swallow a pit or two, the Missouri Poison Center states that the potential risk for toxicity is low. The pit will pass through your body intact and be expelled in your stool. The amygdalin in the cherry pit is only released when it has been crushed or chewed.

Meanwhile, the Morello cherry pit harbors an astonishing 65 mg per gram (2). These stone fruits can produce the equivalent of 0.01–1.1 mg of cyanide in your body, depending on the amount consumed. Eating just 3–4 pits of the Morello cherry or 7–9 pits of red or black cherries may lead to cyanide toxicity",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Suicide will always be painful regardless of method because the human body was designed to fight agaisnt danger.,2563239,FireFox,"Jun 16, 2024 at 3:42 PM","The human body is more resilient than people realise thst is why failed suicide attempts happen .The act of sucide in itself is a harmful act because a person is exposing themselves to dangerand the body is built to fight against danger and prevent a person being drawn to dangerous situations. A child can run across the road without looking or touch fire without any thought because their brains are not developed to detect danger whereas adults brains can recognise danger.

There is no such thing as a peaceful way of passing because the body will fight til the end for your survival.

Why do overdoses and poisoning fail?
The human body can detect posions and harmful agents that enter the body, SN is a posion and the body will recognise it as harmful agent so will fight to expel it out of the body.

The reason why most poisoning and overdoses fail is because the body successfully expels the substance out of the body. The overdoses that do succeed is because the body's defence systems wasn't strong enough to expel the poisonous substance that entered. How strong your body is will determine how successful your method will be.

Why does jumping over train methods or bridges fail at times ?
When people try to jump the body does stop you from making the jump using that fear and anxiety to stop you from jumping properly. This is how people mess up thier angle position and end up with broken bones or paralysis.

Existence is a prison that was imposed by those selfish enough to procreate,2564352,FuneralCry,"Jun 17, 2024 at 3:08 PM","Existence truly is a prison that was so tragically imposed by those selfish enough to procreate and no matter what it'll always be a tragedy to be enslaved in this meaningless and hellish existence, it's so incredibly tragic how those people refuse to leave the non-existent in peace and instead force them into a reality filled with endless harm and potential for the most immense torment.

To me it'll always be deeply criminal and abhorrent how humans so harmfully burden others with something so futile and torturous as human existence especially as true perfection could only lie in never existing at all. It truly is horrific how those people create so much meaningless suffering even know nobody can be harmed by never existing with their being no disadvantages to being unaware for all eternity yet there is no limit as to how much one can suffer as long as they exist.

No matter what existence itself will always be the true problem as it's the source of all suffering, it's already so hellish how life even exists at all even know there was never a need for such but to impose this onto someone else is deeply unacceptable to me. I find it devastating how life continues to be forced here day after day, existence truly is just an endless cycle of suffering that so cruelly repeats once new life is so tragically burdened with the ability to exist.

And because of the immensley harmful decision to impose existence I now have to suffer, it'll always be an abomination to be enslaved in this hellish existence, to be conscious and aware just destined to suffer way more and decay truly is such a hopeless fate.

It truly is so evil how despite the fact that we were so cruelly forced here access to painless death isn't a human right with humans making existence into a prison where one cannot peacefully escape. It just shows how humans truly are the worst, most repulsive species with how they refuse to accept suicide as a valid option and wish to enslave others in this existence they never consented to until their futile, temporary existences disappear into nothingness anyway.

We truly are being punished all because of the crime to procreate, existence is a prison and the tragedy lies in how one cannot easily just be free, only non-existence is desirable to me as it's the eternal absence of all suffering and harm.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Most of the time being brought into the world and experiencing life is a gift from your parents and most of the people in the world view it this way and aren't wrong to do so. For some of us, enough stuff happens or is done or goes wrong with the body and so on that it eventually becomes better to forego the rest of the gift than continue on with it.

But I think anyone who brings a child into the world and treats that child well and raises them to be a good person is doing a positive thing. There are just a lot of places where things can go wrong or damage can be incurred along the way.

Everybody is free to do things their own way and feel however they want to feel...but I don't find it productive to be nor do I find myself driven to be angry at life for existing or angry at anyone for bringing me into existence. I am grateful for that and there were some very good times along the way and I am grateful for those as well.

Most parents put in a lot of effort and all that effort is actually the opposite of selfishness. Part of being a parent is sacrificing your own ego.
I have respect for all parents.

The point is that every human being who decides to create life takes the risk that this life will suffer infinite suffering.
For me, the potential for suffering is much too great to take that risk.
No human on earth wants to create or feel suffering, unless they are a sadist or masochist.
So the crucial question is: Why do I take the risk of creating suffering?
Because humans don't give a damn about the risk. Because they hope it will all work out.
Because THEY want a child. Or THEY even needed a child. Or the child was an accident caused by other selfish actions.

However, if you see it differently, I respect that, I have no choice anyways. And I also respect everyone else who sees it differently.
All the best for you.

...and maybe it was wrong in my posting above to end it with: ""[...]I'm just saying it because it's the truth."" ...
It is MY truth. I'm not on a mission to convert people or anything like that. That's not even possible. Humans will never let themselves die out.

Perhaps providing editorial guidance for each other's suicide notes. Or some people simply don't like the idea of dying alone.

I suppose a local, live-and-in-person variation of the arrangement would be similar, with the added feature of planning to CTB together in the same CO-filled tent, for example. Might present some opportunities to save money by splitting the cost of certain materials.

My CTB journey is just such an intensely personal thing, such that that thought of involving another person just doesn't sit right with me. From my perspective I would rather keep things as simple as possible, and be 100% in control of the process. I want to be able to reschedule things as needed, without worrying about derailing someone else's important plans.

However for other it may be the only way they gain enough confidence to achieve their CTB dreams. Basically everyone gets to figure out what works for them, there is definitely no one-size-fits-all. I'm not even totally against the idea for myself; it just seems highly unlikely that I'll encounter another individual whose logistical, philosophical and aesthetic concerns overlap sufficiently with mine to warrant such a close collaboration.

One is the high risk factor- with both survival and potential complications if survived (I always had this thought of ending up paralysed and having to live the rest of my natural life without any freedom or choice to stb).
The second is the potential of witnesses, I've always been certain that when my time comes I will attempt to do it in a way that will impact as few people as possible. If the last thing I saw was the face of someone standing by as I fell, well, that would be a shit final sight!

People have been killed by jumpers landing on them. It also has to be a sufficient height to work. There was a user here who lost their leg when they survived jumping.

I think a good technique would be to lean forward a bit to gain some angular velocity, jump and hopefully land on my torso. I wanna jump from 125 ft and I read about someone who jumped from 100 ft but survived because they landed on their legs.

Another concern is that survival instinct is particularly bad for this method because it's such a primal instinct. In theory, I am a big fan of a method that kills me in 3 seconds but it's so damn scary. I am currently training to overcome survival instinct by going to the spot repeatedly.

That to me is a good thing. I would be able to simply continue down a few seconds. I think that the registration of the pain would be only enough to realize there was pain if the height is enough and the ground is solid. Impact, organs tear apart and you are instantly unconscious and likely with severed nerves though out the spinal column and then no registration of anything. The key to me is the pain is so incredibly fast. It would be like those poor people killed in the unconventional billionaire submarine when the thing imploded. The time for them to register there was a problem with their brain was shorter than the time that their bodies took to liquefy and compress to a tiny size.

Once I recall falling out of an airplane, passing through the clouds as I approached the ground. Another one I remember was being launched to a great height by a malfunctioned rollercoaster car. A common variation was a car backing off a cliff of some sort.

The thing that struck me the most about these dreams was the hypnotic sense of peace, warmth and calm which accompanied the experience of falling.

It was like, once I became aware that I was falling to certain death, in the absence of any opportunity for struggle, it would fill my entire being with euphoric tranquility. Completely the opposite of the panic you would expect. Having sampled many different kinds of psychoactive drugs, I can tell you this was better ""high"" than any of them. I wish I could do a better job describing it qualitatively. Maybe similar to the sense of ""welcoming"" some people report during their near-death-experience.

As one might expect, the moment I ""made impact,"" the dream would immediately end and I would abruptly wake up. Regardless of the setting of the dream, it was the most incredible feeling of peace and wellbeing I have ever experienced, always triggered by a ridiculously long, fatal fall.

Eh sorry for kinda trailing off. I wonder if anyone else ever had these dreams, though....?

I attempted partial without alcohol 10 years ago. I lost consciousness, but then somehow I regained it and removed the knot. I even don't remember how I overcame survival instinct and attempted, but I really really wanted to die then.
Personally alcohol had made me impulsive and I wanted to jump from a height when I was drunk. So I stopped drinking altogether.

This is just my opinion, so it's your decision at last, but please research well before the final act.

""Full suspension hanging"" is ""normal"" hanging in which your weight is held only by a knot, and if part of your weight is held by other points, it's ""partial hanging"" I think.

It takes a LOT of dedication and resolve to do it because you can usually, easily, reach around yourself and pull yourself ""vertical"" again. Your legs are always on the floor or ground. There are all kinds of iterations of this by using doorknobs, railings, what have you. You can do it kneeling too. I think the key is making sure whatever you use compresses tightly around the right area of the neck when you lean forward and your weight, basically, creayes the force. My cousin used this method and he was successful. You REALLY gotta have it in you to want out of this world and to follow through with it, since it's ""easier"" to reverse it should you change your mind after starting (compared to full suspension).

I do however have a few queries as to when i should take propranolol and the quantity of benzodiazepine. Regime and Items will be posted below

As per the ppeh 2023 it recommends 600mg oxazepam which is roughly equivalent to 300mg benzodiazepine after the SN itself in water. This seems like a very extensive amount and im sure this would knock me right out. Would this interfere even though i am aware that there has been no failed cases simply due to vomiting up SN. I will still be taking a singular 10mg an hour before the SN. Is this too little? after looking at the ppeh figures i am starting to think so.

Propranolol is also widely recommended and i plan to take 600mg of it after SN again in water. I'm not so sure if i should go ahead with this as it does reccomend to take alongside the AE. Will it interfere with the benzos. I just say there is so many different regimes i cannot follow

You can do it safely inside, as far as fire is concerned, but, as others have said, you might be endangering others with the CO. You should really do your homework. If intent on using the bathroom, you need to measure it (in meters) and calculate the volume of it - L x W x H. Then you take that number and multiply it by .135 kg/m³. That will give you the MINIMUM amount of charcoal to use. Multiply that by 4 for assurance. You need to light the charcoals (100% carbon, lump charcoal) outside and wait until they're glowing red and not smoking. THEN you bring them into the bathroom and wait for a while, maybe 20 minutes, maybe 30 minutes, to allow CO to build up. ONLY AFTER THAT do you enter the bathroom. You need to seal any windows thoroughly, around the baseboards, drains, etc. It's a very involved job. It's easier to do in a tent - smaller volume and easier to seal. You, also, need to place whatever metal buckets you put the charcoals in, on something that doesn't conduct heat well, like layers of bricks. You should put up a sign warning others of CO, so that they don't get asphyxiated when they find you. I don't like the idea of doing it indoors AT ALL.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Somebody help me help another person with their toxic relationship,2556516,K9TOOTH,"Jun 11, 2024 at 4:19 AM","I have a friend who's in a rough one with his girlfriend She lies, cheats, backstabs, sets him up for embarrassment and I've talked to him so many times about her. So many I think that's what most of his suicide attempts are about but that part I'm unsure of. It's stressing and overwhelming. He won't leave her and he's been with her for year. His relationship with her is starting to make me frustrated and not of jealousy. I just fucking hate her, I hate whenever he tells me about her or comes to vent me about her cause every time he tells me about her it's always something negative. He says that it's the longest relationship he's had which my father who has a toxic relationship with my mother says the same thing. Wonderful. I've tried to help him with all his issues and it aches me whenever he goes back to the mental hospital. It's like a pain in my chest that has me hyper vigilant 24/7. Every attempt he'll fail and go back to the mental hospital. It's starting to tick me off and I don't wanna get mad at a boy who clearly desires to be loved. I'm not mad at him for that, I'd be patient with him and have but he'll take the simplest fucking things and turns them into into big negative things. An example is I didn't have Wi-Fi so he texts me ""You don't love me, do you? As if we don't talk every day, as if I don't let him vent to me, as if I haven't been trying to help him, as if he doesn't literally claim I treat him better than his girl. Plus his girls a narcissist bitch, I'd blow that brainless skull of hers across my walls if it wouldn't hurt his feelings.

Sorry if I'm getting carried away and this paragraph seems so disorganized. I never want him to know how It's really making me feel because it's starting to make me upset knowing I'm probably not doing good enough to help him. There's a part of me that wish I didn't care for him so much but he can't even see that I care for him. I relapsed cause he told me he took all his meds today. I've tried so hard for both those things not to happen.

TLDR; I care for him, his girl doesn't, he can't see I care for him and I need some help.
Woah holy shit I worded this part wrong. His relationship with his gf and not AT LEAST trying to improve it ticks me off, someone being put in a mental hospital because they really need the help would never tick me off.",2556516,,,,,,,,,,,,

And if I were you, I would distance myself from them because I've seen toxic relationships and they'd rather stay and affect everyone else in their paths than to leave/end it and it's not worth it. If you're her friend, well I wouldn't want a person like that to be my friend to be honest cuz that reflects on me.

Somebody help me help another person with their toxic relationship,2576881,defunkt,"Jun 27, 2024 at 2:52 PM","I got a full idea about your friends mental illness when you talked about the WiFi incident.

I feel like being in a toxic relationship is a vicious cycle.

I used to be in one and got gaslit and all kinds of messed up shit, he was both physically and mentally abusive.

But the way my mom dealt with a toxic man was to just not do anything because she never so much as raised a hand in return, but not me.

Whether it was my abusive brother, father or husband, I'm just the type of person to hit them back. So many times I would pick up anything that was lying around and fling it at them.

Other times I would literally just hit my ex.

Even though the physical damage they did was always far worse, because they were all naturally physically strong and I've always been naturally physically weaker than most.

Not only that but I let my ex be an asshole and cheat and what not, but I also started cheating on him. If not exactly going all the way, I did make out with some people and groped each other.

I used to have panic attacks so frequently I thought I was going mad.

But I was also just like what your friend does to you. I have read about borderline of course, but not been diagnosed.

But the point is, being in a toxic relationship, makes you unhinged and unhappy.

And sounds to me like you're as much in a toxic relationship with your friend as your friend is to that girl.

Heard the line: friends can break your heart too, that is what being in relationships with people who have toxic and narcissist behaviors.

My mom tried to deal with her situation by becoming toxic and narcissist herself.

People her age, especially if you're in Asian countries, they have ZERO self awareness.

And self awareness in general comes when you step out of relationships of this nature.

I stepped out and realized that that guy was nothing more than trash. That delulu rose glasses I was wearing shattered and I saw him as what he truly was, and I had zero feelings for him.

But while you are still in it, every day you will suffer until one of you gets sick of it and leaves.

I think maybe you don't see that you are in just as much of a toxic relationship as your friend.

The minute you get sick of it and leave and start moving on, is the day you will realize what is truly going on.

I've also noticed that when you are with someone like that, you're being gaslit and tormented, it takes away your ability to see clearly what is going on.

Because you're always fighting. With the person and with yourself.

That said I know how hard it is to get out of such a relationship because you become codependent. You become addicted to the mess, to the torment, even to the pain.

You want to leave but you start seeing the other person is also suffering and they are, let's face it.

You know it's not so cut and dry.

Because you care about them no matter how much they hurt you and you'll keep giving yourself excuses to stay. He's too vulnerable right now. He's going to kill himself, if I leave . No one understands him like I do..no one cares about him like I do.

And clearly both you and your friend have been giving yourself excuses to continue to stay.

But I honestly don't blame anyone for staying in relationships like this.

Life fucks you up and then you find that one person that gives you the delusional idea that love is real.

That you need them.

But in truth you're less addicted to the person than you are to the drama and the pain..

I can’t take this.,2589434,flightlessbutterfly,"Jul 8, 2024 at 10:05 AM","I've been holding myself back for years upon years, constantly telling myself to try. People said that it felt soothing. Not nice, definitely not nice. But it quiets every little thought in your head. I've imagined and visualised it over and over. The pain of cutting scares me, but all pain does. What's one more? I want to cut myself so bad, I fantasise about it a lot. But I don't know how to properly do it, and how to handle the physical pain of it. Is the physical pain worth the mental soothing?

They always say 'As long as you tried your best'. But what if I don't want to try anymore? What if my best is NEVER good enough, and it's just a waste of my time? I try, but I never try my 'best'. How can I try my best when I'm constantly at my worst?

Do I deserve to feel like this is my worst? Other people have it worse. Other people suffer more. Other people actually have trauma and phobias and issues that affect them. I'm just a stupid little thing who hates myself but hides it under a mask of self confidence.

I don't fear heights anymore. The adrenaline of being in the sky, of being in danger, it is a temporary salve to the feeling of wanting to cut myself. Of wanting to hurt myself, in more ways than one. I don't want to cut, the idea of physical pain scares me, but I can't take the mental anguish anymore.

how legit does my plan sound?,2589659,black.dahlia,"Jul 8, 2024 at 2:31 PM","im planning on attempting soon. i know i keep saying that and not doing it but i promise i mean it lol. my method is a regular tourniquet. i have no access to firearms and there is nothing in my house sturdy enough to hold my weight without breaking. this is the next best thing.
after reading about the night night method, i used that guide to find my ""sweet spot"" on my neck, but instead of using a ratchet on myself, i found a pair of old leggings and a wooden spoon laying around. (the idea i was going for is to look as inconspicuous as possible while also being functional) after speaking to a member here about a year ago that also left us this way, i think this has a decent shot, albeit not fancy. as also stated in The Last Five Acts, an emergency style tourniquet with household items has proven to work at least a couple times. so im not being totally stupid here.
because i cant do this anywhere but my house, id have to find a way to keep people from not only interrupting me during the act, but also not finding the body afterwards. id much rather the police find me than an unsuspecting household member. i was planning on locking the door i do it in, possibly barricade myself in the room a little bit, (our door knobs barely work) and leave a timed text message/ physical note on the door saying to call the police and not to come in.
after thinking on it nonstop, the most i can muster up for notes are just shitty apologies for basically everything i did, going past just the suicide. ill trash my journal, but keep a couple pages, so people have an idea on my mindset. the suicide should be enough indicator of my mental state already.
my date is still undecided. i feel like a good push to avoid SI would be to do it when my adrenaline is high and im in a crisis. my head is so clear and set on this i know itd be easy for SI to kick in during the act without an active strong motivator, so thats the best i got.
poke holes in this. say whats good about it and whats stupid. i need constructive criticism in this. my method isnt the most reliable, and im not in an ideal environment/situation a person dreams to ctb in. dont be needlessly mean, lol. i just want to do this right. thank you all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

to expand a little bit; i have zero experience or access to firearms, and my house is super old. there are places i could see being able to hold my weight, but those places are out in the middle of the house. if i dont ctb in my room or a spare, itll have to be the bathroom. im not doing it in the middle of the living room or something.
the doorknobs are also over 60 years old, ive checked. i could def try and test the newer ones out though, but id have to get materials for partial.
also, ive been practicing the tourniquet method for a long time since that post ha ha, i know that on this forum people think it wont work and ill end up braindead, but in my personal opinion- i feel like people say that because of how difficult it is to figure out. the more i practice, the better plan i get. its weirdly touching to me how (even though people can be really rude in their delivery) that yall are concerned enough to tell me to find a different method. ive given myself a grace period, so ill look into partial as well absolutely. my choices have gotten less restricting, so im able to actually go outside and get the ropes that are needed and stuff.
but for the past couple of weeks ive devloped a way better plan for tourniquet by just practicing it over and over. im not in a rush to die, so i do it to calm me down and ground me, if that makes any sense? i have a way to get the rod to stay in place, and i found different ways to pad my neck so the skin doesnt pinch and the knot stays where its supposed to.

Candy crush A game we play to earn coins — before spending those same coins to purchase things that enable us to play the game just that little longer.

Life feels no different.

Each of us plays a game — we work our 9–5 jobs. And, just like candy crush, we spend the money we earn internally to the game. We buy food, water, clothes and luxuries. And those items enable us to continue living just that little bit longer.

Candy crush and the game of life carry one common trait — we value playing them both as intrinsically good. For we play them, despite them leading to nothing more than an ability to keep playing.

Of course, over time, this collapses into a boring cycle. Playing this game, day in, day out, with little direction — would leave us feeling both unfulfilled and dissatisfied with our lives.

Evident from the fact that, after a short while, we get bored with candy crush, and stop playing.

The problem is, and this is what I mean when I say JBP has no answer to suicide, there is an assumption that nihilism is a choice. That finding meaning is a choice. If that were the case, suicide would be eradicated, because at it's core, suicide is the rejection of the current order or reality. It's the realization that there is no fundamental meaning to all this, and that the journey of deluding yourself into believing there is meaning is not worth it. It's purpose lost.

In the end, isn't that meaning a delusion. Honestly, ask yourself, are people being nihilistic by choice? If not, how can you imply meaning is a choice?

A game we play to earn coins,2589118,lacrimosa,"Jul 8, 2024 at 1:34 AM","It's all good, honestly, and that's why we're here, to discuss our ideas.

My suicide will be a release from a doomed life once I can't stand the suffering anymore.

Nihilism is the belief in nothing and how life will always involve suffering because of this meaninglessness.

I, however think meaning is in my life in small pieces, like a dark sky with stars that shine but you can't see too many due to light pollution. But nihilism has largely overtaken me due to the constant struggle. Not all others struggle constantly like me and actually enjoy life. I will try my hardest to find meaning in life or create beyond myself. Even though I fear death, I fear life more so I fear death less than life or hardly at all compared to life. I also fear the impact my CTB will have on my family. It is so final if and when I do CTB, there will be no hope left for me. But my family will understand, if not sooner, then definitely later.

The realization that life is meaningless permits someone to look into themselves to derive their own meaning according to Nietzsche. That's like starting with a lump of clay or an empty canvas. At first it is meaningless but if you add just a modicum of effort, you can create something of value but you must walk deliberately into suffering and use it to your advantage. By inviting suffering in and using it to your advantage, you must not allow a lethargic indifference to overtake you but to overcome your suffering by creating beyond yourself or by becoming a superman (neo human that doesn't believe in God but has replaced God with higher human values). And thus adding your own personal values to your life...

Take a body builder for example... Their muscles hurt after a work out but that's because of lactic acid and the fact that their muscles are literally being broken down and are growing and becoming bigger, thus making them stronger. Thus, Nietzsche's quote - That what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.... But, I don't think he was referring to lifting weights lol...",,,,,,,,,,,,,
A game we play to earn coins,2589498,waterworks,"Jul 8, 2024 at 11:35 AM","A fair point of view
I can understand the sentiment of a doomed life, I'll be leaving soon as well
I don't think this is a complete assessment, not all nihilists believe life will always involve suffering. While in some instances suffering is apparent and is part of life, there are also moments without it. I think the fundamental and unifying thought among all nihilists, is the lack of intrinsic meaning to life and existence.
I understand this and in some ways relate to it. Though with me, it is hard to fathom what finding meaning would be. I mentioned before that it seems akin to delusion; though with delusion there is some lack of self awareness. Telling myself something has meaning, when I'm clearly confronted with the lack of it, always bring me back to my initial nihilism.
This, I think, leads to existentialism or is the foundation for it. In JBP's lectures he addresses how the architecture of the bible has god as the conscious expression of the highest moral values. That's one way to look at the pursuit for meaning, as an almost faith based obedience to values beyond yourself. But here's the problem I see, for citizens in say ancient times, when slavery was morally just according to that culture, a blind obedience to those values perpetuated human suffering. Now, I'm not saying ""blind"" to mean they never thought about these things and were sheep; I mean it was not apparent to them that their morals were not as great as they thought.

Now bring that to today's world. What values do we have that we cannot conceive as wrong? Are we truly believing we have reached the highest possible moral standard? If not, how do we know what we don't know yet? For instance, JBP argues that freedom of speech supersedes the legislative power to enforce speech (the pronoun controversy). But what if the higher moral duty is to displace this freedom of speech, for the regulated speech in order to ensure the lives of these other ""gendered"" individuals have less suffering? In short, how can you ever know if your morals are worth dedicating your life to. At least with the idea of god, this question doesn't arise, because there is not better intelligence/power to decide such than a tri-omni god itself.

Suicide by chainsaw,2495557,Jorms_McGander,"May 1, 2024 at 11:46 PM","Yeah I know, you're gonna say that suicide by chainsaw is a ridiculous idea, and it's surely not as popular as some other less violent methods, but for some people it has been the path to mortal release and they have done so for a variety of reasons. So I'd like to just share some of those people. I don't have an academic license to access articles so I am restricted to abstracts, public facing articles, news articles, and whatever I can unlock with the extension available at unpaywall.org. If you see initials it's cuz the full name is in the source. By the way the indentations are my own words and I basically only did that because TIL that ctrl+] indents a whole paragraph.

So without further adieu let's go to Florida:

TM is an inmate in the Florida prison system with schizophrenia and a history of suicide attempts. He landed in the system because he pushed his truck into a lake, so he was arrested for littering over 500lbs. He had avoided his medication for approximately a week by the time of his suicide, and was obviously struggling and not receiving sufficient support within the system. One day on work duty he walked over to a chainsaw on the ground, pulled the cord a few times, stood up and pressed it to his own neck. It is hard to understand all symptoms of schizophrenia, but the anger and isolation at being misunderstood are universal human experiences and no doubt the reaction of his peers to him played a role in his choosing such a violent end.

And now let's take a trip to the academic ether

We will meet a 58 year old caucasian man in a case of what's called a complex suicide. You'll also encounter complex in other contexts like a complex trauma might involve elements of crushing and laceration in the same injury, and a complex suicide in this case involves elements of chainsaw and hanging. So to speak. This man's wife found him ""hanging from the basement ceiling of the cellar in which he lived."" He had moved down there a couple of years prior due to increasing reclusiveness. The article doesn't speak to his relationship with his wife--he was found three hours after death, which suggests that she was engaged in trying to care for him and holds some compassion, but I am speculating and that's as far as I will go. He was taking medication for depression and had previously attempted to OD using those plus alcohol, but it didn't work. There is a path of escalation in behaviour from socially isolating to attempts at nonviolent suicide to his successful suicide. This man's daily routine was to look after his garden in the morning, and then do some wood working in the afternoon. One morning he walked out into his garden, turned his chainsaw on and pressed it against his stomach. He stopped before complete disembowelment. I wonder if he knew that he successfully lacerated his intestines and had nearly disemboweled himself, but he stopped using the chainsaw at that point and went inside and hanged himself from a rafter. The fact that the study doesn't describe the rope as being blood soaked suggests it may have been placed there prior, as the location of other blood [garden, underneath corpse] is noted.

Now we can travel over to academics publishing out of France

A 32 year old Asian woman who was an engineer. I can't get past the abstract for her so I don't know why she was suffering, but I do know she was determined and intelligent and she had a chainsaw. She built a structure out of wood about 1.5M tall with the chainsaw at the top resting on two blocks. There were pulleys, water bottles as counterweights, and elastics secured to the floor. This would control the movement of the chainsaw as it descended once cutting through the blocks upon which it rested. So one day, she lied down facing the floor underneath her homemade chainsaw-guillotine and pressed the power switch she had built for it. The chainsaw cut through its restraints and descended smoothly, cutting through her cervical vertebrae and spinal cord.

Now heading to the UK we'll meet DP

DP was the last man living in a flat determined by his council to be demolished. It is described as ""repossessed"" but it doesn't sound like DP had to do with that because he was the only tenant and had refused eleven offers of alternative living arrangements. This is a case of somebody who needs more support than he was being given--I can't find any information on what was driving him to be so attached to his living space. We can say though, that it wasn't an adaptive position for him to be in. Eventually the council went to court to get an injunction to force him to relocate and allow for whatever progress was slated to occur, and this was the last straw for DP. He tied his chainsaw to the leg of his pool table, rigged up a timer to activate the chainsaw, and laid down underneath it. He placed a piece of cardboard on his neck, the teeth of the saw on the cardboard, and then he turned on the timer and waited. I get the impression that DP did not feel listened to in his situation, his agency may have been eroded and ultimately he responded in one of the only ways he could think of, by inflicting upon himself an incredibly violent death. I can only wonder if there was a way to help him transition without driving him to that.
The UK went through a process of ""dude wtf"" after 9 news agencies reported a whoooole bunch of detail, so I had to use two sources to assemble this story and one is not reliable but it preserves the details after the UK media smartened up and unpublished the deets. Source1 Source2

Now finally we'll take a trip to Serbia

With an academic article I can only access the abstract regarding, a 39 year old man was found dead in a meadow. A chainsaw was lying beside him, and his wounds were restricted to his head, neck and shoulder. He would have been right handed as his left carotid, jugular, and vagus nerve were all completely severed. He managed to cut into C5 and C6 vertebrae and sever his own spinal cord. There were striped lacerations on his left shoulder, so the blade sorta rested there as he did the cut. Finally, this man's job was as a lumberjack so I had to include him because he is the only lumberjack I found in the chainsaw suicides.

Well that's all I got for you. I hope you found this assembly of chainsaw suicides informative. If you get into some of the academic sources you can find a little more related reading, but then you're getting into band saws and circular saws and one 23 year old male who survived giving himself a chainsaw to the neck.

Suicide by chainsaw,2495560,Linda,"May 1, 2024 at 11:56 PM","I work a lot with chainsaws, of several different types, because there are many trees on my farm. I have no doubt that suicide by chainsaw is a possibility. I also have no doubt that it would be risky, and difficult to carry out effectively. There is a real risk that you would survive, but with serious injuries. The basic problem is that a chainsaw is not designed to be held and manipulated in the ways you would need to use it if you wanted to cut your head off. I have just done some simple tests with two of my saws (with the engine off, of course). With the smaller saw, with a 25 cm bar, I could easily get it into position, but such a small saw might not do the job effectively. The larger saw with a 45 cm bar, is much heavier, and I found it almost impossible to position it stably where it could cut my head off.
Bottom line: I would suggest you look for a different method.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I personally feel that those of us the share your feelings can only do one thing that is under our control. And that is to eliminate all probability of forcing someone else to possibly have to suffer through decades of the same thing. By not having children of our own. And those of us that do decide to have children better put 100% into it. No days off. It was a choice you made, and your responsibility.

What I don't like is all the commenters trying to invalidate your question by accusing you of not providing empirical evidence to backup your perception. Or that suggest that most people here don't agree with you, when in fact there are many here (including myself) that do. It's doesn't take a rocket science to see all the people around that hate ther jobs and complain about having to go to work. Or see articles about the nets that Apple has to install under the windows of their factories in China to prevent workers from jumping to their deaths. One google search could retrieive countless job satisfaction survey results pointing to the fact that the majority of the population don't like what they do for a living and only do it to survive.

Nor should you even have to justify anything in the first place. It's how you feel and people should respect that and not insinuate that you have some sort of twisted mindset. Everyone is here on this forum for a reason and nobody's reason deserves to be invalidated.

The current dynamic of human society is pretty much a zero sum game. At least in capitalistic cultures. For one person to make money, another person has to lose money. Often by being cheated or robbed. For one person to be successful, another person has to be taken advantage of.

Suicide is not rational or irrational,2589292,martinso67,"Jul 8, 2024 at 6:54 AM","It does not matter, because regardless one will die for sure. Deciding against suicide is only procrastinating your death. You could do a horrible way and suffer a lot before you are dead in some cases (for example having a chronical disease).

It's irrational thinking that one will live forever. That thinking is from the natural disposition (like needing to have frequently) that wants your genes to multiple and spread is much as possible. Which will only happen when you live as long as possible.

I hate that society sees death as something very tragedic that should not happen. Yeah, like it's not part of nature. It's something evil.
Human egos and narcissm are what's really evil. Like only human should live and deserve eternal life or paradise. That's not the case for animals or plants. Or other creature (insects, bacteria, etc.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whilst it is true that suicide is merely just bringing the inevitable closer, I still do believe that there are rational ways for wanting to be dead earlier. For example, if somebody who is in a poor family doesn't want to wage slave and can't afford to be a neet, suicide would be a rational thing for them to do as it's only by suicide through which they can avoid having to work. Or, another example, I want to minimise the amount of suffering I experience on this planet and, rationally, the only way to do so is by killing myself as early as possible.

Suicide is not rational or irrational,2589356,Forever Sleep,"Jul 8, 2024 at 8:09 AM","I suppose it can't be utterly rational because we don't know all the answers. Like any life changing decision we make for ourselves in life, it's based on our best guess. We can be sure that we don't enjoy our present moment or some of our past moments. The future is sort of guesswork but people who suicide likely have a fairly certain idea it's going to be bad! We also know deep down how we feel about life. Is it even something that feels valuable and worth prolonging?

Really though- I would argue that the process of contemplating it carefully is rationalising- surely? Why do I hate my life so much? Is there anything I can do to change it significantly enough? What are all of my options? Both regarding living and dying. Then, we come to our own conclusions. That's a rational thought process I'd say.

People may say it's irrational because they could see a way for that person to solve their problems. That's based on their own pro-life viewpoint though. That person may well have considered that option and, for whatever reason- rejected it.

I think it's impossible to really put a rational or irrational label on a choice which is largely subjective. Whether we like or despise something is subjective. It isn't rational or irrational to either like or dislike porridge. It's personal taste. If you're allergic to it though- it makes more sense to hate it.

Where pro-lifers may rebuke this would be with regards to mental illness. That person simply isn't thinking clearly so- they're not even capable of making a rational decision. I wonder if the link they seem always to make between ideation and mental illness is our biggest hurdle. It basically strips us of any autonomy because- supposedly, we aren't mentally sound enough to make decisions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"Plan ""Z"" - in case I won't ctb, how can I get ready for the inevitable pain when I get older?",2588860,Motoko,"Jul 7, 2024 at 7:15 PM","I have some physical conditions and they will not get cured, that's for sure. If anything, it will probably get worse with my age. I'm scared that there will be a day where suddenly it will hit a breaking point and I will be living with huge pain or disability, or I will be forced to lay in bed until I die etc. Maybe it will be like this in 3 years, maybe in 30 years. This is my fear.
I was wondering. In case I won't have the guts to ctb and I will let my physical conditions to overtake everything, is there any way to prepare? I was thinking about reading some books like ""how to live with cancer"". I don't have a caner, nothing even close to that, but I'm assuming that maybe there will be some methods on how to cope. It all comes down to your mind I guess, right? To keep yourself sane and conscious and to be able somehow to detach your mind from the body. Maybe meditation would be helpful?
What I mean basically is that I want to be prepared when that day comes. I think it would put some pressure off and maybe I would be less stressed thanks to that. Because it's not just about being prepared for death, it's about being prepared for the process/period that comes right before death - and in some cases, for some people with some diseases, it takes even years.
Did anyone try to approach this like this? In case you won't ctb, then at least to be ready for the all the stuff that's been building in you?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Beachy Head,2589258,fallingasl33p,"Jul 8, 2024 at 6:11 AM","Beachy head or anything other than a perfectly straight drop down to concrete is extremely risky if you ask me. I always think of attempts of the Empire State Building where people instead hit one of the buildings below or the videos of the people jumping off the hoover dam. Because it's a slope you see their body ricochet (as it would from a rock on a cliff face) and it violently breaks a limb(s) before they finally slide and hit the bottom. I'm also reminded of a 9/11 jumper than somehow survived the initial impact but mangled irreparably from the torso down, pleading to a first responder who put a black tag on her that's she wasn't dead. Or anytime there's water involved aka bridge/cliff I just think about how if you survive the initial impact you're now meters and meters underwater, bones shattered, in total shock and you die with every fibre of your being on fire as your lungs fight for oxygen to cling to life.

Point is to guarantee 'success' there's a lot more to consider than meets the eye. You might be lucky and hit your head on something first on the way down or your final moments could be a mix of sheer terror and agony.

We like to pretend that we're civilized, but we're still really just a bunch of dumb, selfish, hairless apes. We're truly no better than the animals we claim superiority over.

To me, natalism is one of the biggest signs of that. There's just something incredibly simian about disregarding all logic just to have a bunch of caveman sex and spread your seed around. It doesn't matter if the child will suffer a life of sickness, poverty etc. ""Continuing the bloodline"" is clearly more important.

Unfortunately, people are like animals because they get together and they're attracted to each other because of hormones and they start having babies without even thinking about it and then a year or two they don't even know each other and then they get a divorce and then the poor kids are from a broken home.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

procreation is wrong in my eyes,2589063,Darkover,"Jul 8, 2024 at 12:16 AM","these are just my opinion

You don't have to presume that everyone's life is unworthy, or that the lives of specific people are unworthy, or that actually no one's life is unworthy, in order to hold anti-natalist positions.

It is sufficient to know that the life of certain people would be unworthy in their eyes and that they would prefer not to have been created, in order to oppose reproduction.

And the reason is that with every reproduction there is a chance of creating a life that is unworthy, not in our eyes but in the eyes of those who will live it. Since it is impossible to know in advance which cases of reproduction will create an unworthy life, or if and when a life will become unworthy in the eyes of those who live it, all cases of reproduction are morally wrong.

We do not have to determine for people that their lives are unworthy, but only to know that unworthy lives in the eyes of those who live them are always a possibility, and that it is never a possibility that those who were never created will somehow be harmed by it. These two premises are sufficient to establish an anti-natalist claim without any need to determine for anyone that their lives are not worthy.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

procreation is wrong in my eyes,2589111,Forever Sleep,"Jul 8, 2024 at 1:18 AM","I agree there is something in this. If we truly were free to pursue our own wishes- including suicide and, if assisted suicide was painless and reliable- it would seem more fair. That person genuinely would have a choice in life and who knows? Maybe, they will turn out to enjoy it- even for a while.

Life isn't like that at all though. We get born into a system we are expected to comply to. It isn't a particularly nice or fair system for a lot of people. Illnesses occur, tragedies occur, major traumas occur. That person will very likely have to comply to getting a job to (just about) support themselves.

And they won't just be allowed to leave when they want. It will be made incredibly difficult for them to leave in fact. Both emotionally- through emotional blackmail- think of how your suicide will devastate your loved ones, suicide is a selfish and cowardly act etc.

And, physically it's made so that the relatively painless methods are illegal or hard to access. So- the choice we do get is to risk maiming ourselves via a brutal method, possibly traumatising others- again- playing on emotional blackmail- do you really want to inflict that image on strangers or loved ones? And if we fail- involuntary sectioning, possible loss of employment, likely change in the way everyone sees and treats us.

I agree- it would be slightly different if suicide was seen differently and if it were permissable in this society but- it isn't- whatsoever in many parts of the world. They won't even let you die peacefully if you're terminally ill and dying anyway!

So- for some of us, we're literally being born into a prison sentence that we don't even get let out of for good behaviour. Ironically, we're all pretty much born onto death row when you think about it. It would be funny if it didn't involve so much suffering.",2589086,,,,,,,,,,,,

I understand your concern that even one person feeling unworthy is one too many - but is it really concern about that 'hypothetical one person' or is it about your negative experiences of the world? Many people go through life - they have challenges - but ultimately the good outweighs the bad.

By telling people not to do something, that is perfectly natural, I feel you are trying to control others and make them do what you want. Is this any different to what you say the world is doing to you?

"Dissociating, Procrastinating CTB",2589140,dazed.daydreamer,"Jul 8, 2024 at 2:53 AM","Has anyone else dealt with wanting to CTB in a logical sense, but being too depressed (lethargic, apathetic) and spaced out/dissociated to muster the energy and will to do so in the moment?

I've had severe depression for about a decade now, and often find myself (I think) dissociating because of it—heavy brain fog, detached from my emotions and experience, can't concentrate, and now at the worst it's been, I cannot work and can barely think half the time.

I've experienced suicidal ideation for many years now as well, on and off. TLDR so that this doesn't get super long: I've done all I reasonably can to try and combat my depression and remained optimistic through many low points that this could eventually be fixed/managed. But, after exhausting my options while my mental state has only worsened to the point that I am dysfunctional and am incapable of doing the work to build a worthwhile life, I have solidified my decision to commit suicide, beyond any transient urges to do so.

With that, it would be much more convenient for me to CTB ASAP (current depressive episode led me to not completing a major project due now, and I'd rather not have to deal with the fall out if I'm just gonna off myself regardless), but I'm so spacey and lethargic that I haven't been able to bring myself to do it over the past few days. I'm probably being impatient and could just wait until the depressive episode passes, which should be pretty soon, and I regain some energy. But is this relatable to anyone?

Dark Web,2615030,dweams,"Jul 30, 2024 at 9:39 PM","I wouldn't say it's ""not secure at all."" It really depends on what you're using the Tor network for.

The official Tor manual has a section on how to access the network on mobile devices: https://tb-manual.torproject.org/mobile-tor/

I suggest OP does this. While SN is legal in Europe and the USA, it's best to use Tails just to be safe. You can learn how to set it up and find other helpful information in the DNM Buyer's Bible.

Don't use a VPN with the Tor browser. Just use the Tor browser. The explanation of why this is better is a bit long, but basically a direct connection to the Tor network is usually the way to go.

Search engines for the Tor network are not very helpful. Finding good sites involves looking through link collection pages on various onion sites. These pages are made by the site owners, so all the links are usually legit.

But since you're new, start by searching the dark web forum ""Dread"" for various things.",2588504,2589121,2588437,2588437,,,,,,,,,
Dark Web,2615077,failure383,"Jul 30, 2024 at 11:30 PM","First of all, you don't need Tor to buy SN at all, but as everyone else in the thread recommends, it's good to use Tor when searching for vendors in the clearnet. Just search with a clearnet search engine and after some time, you should find some site, that sellls SN.
That's not good practice. If you don't want your ISP seeing, that you use Tor, then Tor bridges are vastly superior in every imaginable way. Tor Bridges are free and run by volunteers. Please look into it.
https://bridges-test.torproject.org/
I wouldn't visit DNM on a phone. Unlike clearnet vendors, most DNM vendors don't even offer to purchase SN, only for opioids, benzos and illegal poision. You are putting yourself needlessly at risk with using a phone as mobile operating systems are not designed to be secure and are insufficiently protected against malware and fingerprinting (unlike Tails OS, which is an operating system, that works only on desktop/laptop computers, but can be run off a USB-stick, so you could just use somebody's else computer).

If you still insist of using your phone, then at least disable Javascript completely (Safest security level in Tor browser settings), but that's good practice everywhere. Also get some way to manage PGP keys, as most markets nowadays require you to have that, to talk to a vendor.
If what he is using Tor for, is visit DNM, then there is a good chance he'll encounter some malicious site/honeypot. Even when looking for reputable DNMs, you are still putting yourself needlessly at risk when using a phone. The fingerprint will blatantly stand out of the crowd and phone security is just sup-par to Tails OS.",2588437,2588437,2615030,,,,,,,,,,
Dark Web,2615663,dweams,"Jul 31, 2024 at 2:30 PM","Oh, I definitely agree that if someone is going to visit DNMs, Tails is recommended. I was just speaking in terms of threat models earlier.

I think I may have figured out a way to end it in a way that looks natural,2570193,MettleSpirit41,"Jun 22, 2024 at 4:44 AM","So I am new here, this is my second post. In my first post I was rooting for Potassium Chloride injection for a way to ctb (I really don't know what this means, but I see everyone using the term 'ctb' instead of passing or d*ath or dy**g, so I am using it here. Feel free to educate me about that. P.S. I have come up with a full form of my own for it which is 'cutting the bullshit') that might look normal, but I was made aware of the many problems that I would face if I chose that route. So I kept researching and came across a tree called Cerbera Odollam aka ""suic*de tree"". This tree has a fruit which at its core contains a highly toxic large seed which gives the tree its infamous name. It has a toxin called cerberin which affects the cardiovascular system.

While I still need to do much research, I genuinely believe this is a very good method to make it look like a natural heart attack, because where I am from there is only one test through which this toxin could be detected in the body, but that is also only possible when the patient informs that they have ingested this seed. (I am still not entirely sure about its undetectability, so I need to do more research on that, but other than that, this seems like a promising way)

So I believe this method could be it. Just like I said in my previous post, I plan on taking a very high dose of this along with some other medications to counter other symptoms such as nausea and vomiting and some sleep medicines to knock me out.

Here is the link to an article about the tree for more information.

A possible alternative to SN,2579397,Phenylhydroxylamine,"Jun 29, 2024 at 5:21 PM","Hello, I've lurked this site over the years (although the last year I've not been watching it much) and decided to finally make an account because I feel I have some potentially useful information to share.

As you probably know, sodium nitrite is an effective CTB method because it induces methemoglobinemia, which seems to be a relatively painless way to die. I think it can cause headache and some stomach discomfort, but personally I feel I can tolerate that. Anyways, I was researching other substances that can cause methemoglobinemia and found that both lidocaine and benzocaine can induce it. These are both easy to obtain online (at least here in the US), with benzocaine being the easiest to obtain. When benzocaine is metabolized by the liver, a redox cycle occurs with phenylhydroxylamine and nitrosobenzene, producing o2- (superoxide), which turns your hemoglobin into methemoglobin. Chubbyemu has a good video on this on YouTube, just look up ""Chubbyemu mouth numbing spray"", where he talks about a man who drank a bottle of mouth numbing spray containing (probably 5%) benzocaine.

Okay now I'll talk about important details. First off, there seems to be 2 different methods used to dissolve benzocaine to make a solution for mouth numbing sprays. Benzocaine is not soluble enough in water to make a numbing solution, so other things must be used. The first method is to use alcohol (ethanol), since benzocaine is quite soluble in it. The other is to use polyethylene glycol, often one called ""PEG 400"". I believe this is what mouth numbing sprays that say ""alcohol free"" are using. In my opinion, the PEG 400 solution would be best if attempting to ingest benzocaine because the PEG mostly passes through your body without interacting, thus reducing the amount of interactions to consider.

Lastly, I had the idea for just making phenylhydroxylamine and consuming that directly. This would bypass the need for the liver to produce it from the benzocaine, and would maybe work better. It is also more water soluble, which also happens to be the reason why the liver turns benzocaine into it in the first place. Surprisingly, it doesn't seem too hard for the home chemist to make. All you need to do is reduce nitrobenzene with zinc dust. Nitrobenzene can be produced by nitrating benzene using nitric acid and sulfuric acid, and benzene can be produced by reacting sodium benzoate (easy to acquite food preservative) with sodium hydroxide, and then distilling off the benzene.

Anyways, hopefully sometime soon I will be attempting with this, and I will try and get some trusted 3rd party on this forum to witness it and report back to you all how it goes :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,

How can I make my suicide look natural?,2586879,nbk4755,"Jul 6, 2024 at 3:09 AM","I guess its somewhat straightforward to look 'natural' (or at least unintentional) but it would not be pleasant at all. If you live somewhere with cold winter months and nearby enough to a large wooded/forest area it is easy enough to tell family that you are going solo camping or hiking, and then just get purposefully lost and starve or freeze to death. Similarly you could technically go somewhere high like a mountain and fall off, but inconsistent terrain and availability based on the landscape where you live makes it a toss-up.

It's also worth noting that any suspicion beforehand would affect it. Ex. do you have any formal diagnoses, or a history of mental illness, etc. And afterwards if any evidence is left (like an account here), there is chance it is found and ruins any possibility

It is very hard to conceal most procedures. Any chemical methods are almost guaranteed to be detected in autopsy and others like hanging cannot be assumed accidental.

Loneliness makes my suicidal thoughts even worse,2584458,FireFox,"Jul 3, 2024 at 11:09 PM","Honestly since turning 27 it upsets me realising how lonely I am. I have no real world friends, no boyfriend and my immediate family never listen whenever I reach out and complain about how I am making their lives difficult or how much I am upsetting the family if i do open up honestly about being depressed. My extended family relatives do not even care about me. In African Immigrant families family is a massive deal and growing up other immigrant families I knew had loving aunties, uncles and cousins always supporting them if they are going through difficult times whereas my relatives are nothing like that. In my mother and grandmothers eyes the relatives can do no wrong. My relatives get away with everything because of ""Christian forgiveness"" constantly being weaponsied, it's abuse.

Since my adoptive grandfather died in 2020 I have been struggling to cope with the grief, he was the closet thing I had to grandfather figure. He was the only family member who actually cared. If my grandmother and mother had problems financially he always helped while NONE of the relatives cared. He was so proud of my achievements in my life while other relatives were jealous of my achievements.

What kind of relatives get jealous of other family members achievements ?

● I have relatives in my parents home country who are jealous of the family members living in the western countries. The jealously is revolting. For example One of my relatives was so furious at my grandmother for moving to the UK to go help my mother look after me. This relative complained to the whole family about how my grandmother abandoned them.

● I have family members who like seeing other family members fail its so disgusting the glee they have their voices when they hear a relative has failed. When I got fired I was not allowed to mention it to the relatives because they were going to be finding hilarious and enjoying every minute of it. My mum told me this a couple of days after my firing at work,.

● I have older womren relatives who are even jealous of the fact I went to university because they didn't complete secondary school and their own kids got pregnant with multiple children before the age of 20.

Growing up all I have ever known is relatives using and discarding everybody even the family members I thought was ""good"" are just a disappointment too users like everybody.

As I grow older I worry about my mum and grandmother dying because I will have no one to talk too and bond with. I have a great relationship with my younger sister but I need people to talk too and spend time with. This is why I plan to kill myself in my 30s. Everyone else my age is married while I am just single with no friends and don't have relatives who care for me. I can't cope anymore",,,,,,,,,,,,,

If my family and I don't visit relatives the relatives overseas the relatives spread lies and make false accusations of why we didn't vist them, its emotional abuse to the max. My grandmother and mother care way too much about what these relatives think.

I plenty of stories of how bad it is in my family. In the summer of 2016 my grandmothers mother died suddenly she was 102. My grandmother needed to go to her funeral. I couldn't go because my passport expired at the time.

My mum found a last minute flight for my grandmother to go alone and when we went to the airport we were told the scheduled flight got cancelled because a passenger got severely ill and there was no other flights available to get to the country my grandmother needed to go.

My grandmother missed the funeral as a result. The relatives spread lies and rumours on why we didn't attend the funeral. The lies were how my mum didn't want my grandmother go to the funeral and other lies were how our flight cancellation was made up

The covid19 pandemic was the best thing that ever happened because I finally got what I wanted a world without seeing my relatives. The two years of the pandemic was pure peace never seeing these relatives ever again.

In his work, spring is a symbol of death. That is, when saying ""spring will come,"" it means that death will come.

This song is not really about ctb, but rather about the expectation of death, but about something desired and long-awaited.

""Spring will come after me"" - this is pronounced with horror, but at the same time with expectation and reverence;
""With ringing sun into emptiness"" - death is the only salvation that will illuminate the darkness and emptiness in the soul;
""She never lies"" - death is inevitable;
""She knows that I'm waiting"" - and is long-awaited.

Snowman is an anthropomorphic character. And spring comes with warmth - the snowman melts, ""dies"".

Spoiler: Music clip


In the video, a girl in the image of spring (death) walks for a long time, but in the end ""kills"" winter. The snow is starting to melt.

""Spring will cry and hold me with her warmth
And I will rest my tearful face on her shoulder"" - the snowman melted, the tears ended.

Perhaps for an English-speaking listener the text will seem too primitive, or, conversely, too complex. The same way many songs in English sound to me.
But I tried to explain as best I could. I hope it worked.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

songs about suicide,2523885,Abyssal,"May 17, 2024 at 12:01 AM","Took a look at my vocaloid playlist that dates back quite some years. These will be odd and probably not what you're looking for but ya know, whatever.

Ayano's theory of happiness-JIN | I mean, it's literally your pic.

World's end dancehall-wowaka (rest in peace man) | gotta love a bury your gays.

The Little Mermaid-idk | this is old old vocaloid, probably aged really bad but there's suicide in it so ya know. Sang by Luka.

Goodbye [Hatsune Miku English] - VocaCircus | Miku dies in English

Hello Again [Hatsune Miku English] - VocaCircus | Miku survives in English. Recovery song that goes hard af

Psychotic Len's Love Song (yandelenka) - Lelele P | older than the mermaid one and probably trash, still a suicide vocaloid song with a hint of nostalgia

The Things I deserve - GHOST | Based on the ghosts real experience with a near train suicide. This one is probably the best song on the list imo

Solitary Hide and Seek envy - koyori | Child suicide attempt from bad divorce and shitty parents

Plastic Girl - Yuugou P | Vocaloid cringe with an earworm kinda chorus, but if you've ever wanted to kill your bullies then this is the song for you.

""There's Supposed to be a Cheat Code for Happiness"" - Utata P | DAMN EARWORM takes some getting used to but kinda good tbh!

Meltdown - Iroha | If you know vocaloid you better know this one

Self-Aflicted Achromatic - nekobolo | This one's so good

Shinigatari (You wanna die?) - Nashimoto Ui | Old one but a gold one. A bit more angry and about people faking being suicidal for attention.

Hated by Life Itself - mafumafu | Honestly anything by mafumafu is good.

I had prepped myself but out of no where my family found my ig which is just my art but sometimes I will overshare in the caption ( my fault really ) so I guess this time I caught the attention of my brother who alerted my family. They wanted to report me but I had to lie and say I'm not suicidal and don't plan on doing something. I had to say it was just for my art and it's not a big deal. Now I feel hesitant to do it as it might be too soon if everyone is on high alert and will possibly check on me. My biggest fear is not succeeding and being saved. Just so unsure now. I could wait til maybe Wednesday when things have calmed? It sucks because I was so ready to go now and delaying (again) feels like another failure among many but if I do it and it fails I won't have another shot.

Forgot about this man completely. Haven't thought of him in years.

I got yelled for an hour at by half of my family for telling them I would not be attending the funeral of someone in our family.

I showed my parents a message where he asked me to bring a ""hot friend"" or ONE OF MY SISTERS to stay a week with him in his one bed camper.

My dad laughed.
My mom told me not to tell anyone. So I never did.

This is hardly the most traumatic thing that has ever happened to me. Multiple men have physically raped me. Some with weapons. This man never touched me.. but it hits different.. we are related.

I ignored him for years. I stopped going to family events. I am not close to a single person I'm related to. Yet,
I'm the villain for pulling away.

Everywhere IRL , websites , social media, tv , movies etc we have to constantly see life praised, That (life) which tortured us constantly praised everywhere.

This is one of the few places u can say life is bad.

A lot of people had similar thoughts as @FuneralCry did. However we never hear others say it because those thoughts are censored everywhere. So her posts validated what we were thinking . Put in words what we were thinking . So many people didn't feel alone, isolated or crazy for having these thoughts. She got at least 93,000 almost 100k likes: so all these people agreed with her. Many of us don't have the energy or time to post our thoughts.

Everywhere IRL , social media, media, movie , TV , etc it's ok to praise life the biggest torturer of humans. But if anyone says life is bad then that's censored.They want to keep the illusion that life is good going to keep the slaves in the prison . The biggest lie is that life is good

It's not pro Death to state the truth. The pain and horrible things that can happen to any human far outweigh any ""enjoyable"" crap. There is nothing worth Getting 95% of ur skin burned off in a fire but remaining alive. That's objectively bad what's subjective is the supposedly enjoyable garbage

I worked in a nursing home. People there were suffering beyond anything that can be imagined. Most humans are going to get very old . Imo most have no idea what is coming for them in old age

Most people think they are immune to all these horrible things that happened to others and can happen to anyone

One is not part of a death cult to state the truth that life is bad

They can keep praising life irl , social media , movies , etc. I see through the lies and will never believe that life is good. I will always believe life is the worst function in the universe

It's ridiculous . If what someone is posting bothers u just put them on ignore don't follow them to all the threads campaigning for their removal just because u disagree with what they say.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

She NEVER, not even once, referenced any specific member when writing her views critical of the site and the ""bend"" she perceived the site had taken towards a pro-life stance. It was only when people attacked her viewpoint that she was forced, on a few occasions, to defend her beliefs, her VALID beliefs, valid because they are hers, as valid as yours are to you. I disagreed with 99% of her views, and I let her know it on many occasions. I didn't attack her, I challenged her views. That's how it should be done.

There's only so many times you can post ""This world is so cruel and vile...how much must we suffer in our lives? Why does society do this to us?"" before the efficacy of that venting starts to wear off and it just makes it seem like you're posting just for attention.

I've also seen a few posts on (albeit dreadful) sites like KWFarms mention her and there was quite a lot of theorising that she was pro-suicide and actually encouraging users to CTB when they otherwise wouldn't through her dramatic writing. One other person theorised she wasn't actually suicidal at all and was just a troll posting to make the tone of the forum more miserable so that people would CTB more often, which is truly monstrous. Again, this is just theorising though, I don't necessarily agree with this, but there be rumours and shit.

When she does get unbanned though, I would like to introduce the FC Drinking Game: Take a shot everytime you read one of her posts and see the word ""cruel"" or ""suffering"" in it. Most, if not all of us, would be dead by the fourth post probably.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Whether she will be unbanned or not depends on the mods and their decision",2587764,,,,,,,,,,,,
,2588754,Forever Sleep,"Jul 7, 2024 at 5:30 PM","Personally, I have nothing against FC and I agree with other members, that if someone in particular triggers you, it's easy enough to put them on 'ignore'.

I suspect she wasn't banned for venting about life but more so for venting about how the forum ought to be. I'd say there could be just cause there...

Put it this way- when other members are afraid of coming off as too pro-life- it's likely because they don't feel free to express how they really feel.

Of course- this is a pro-choice website. So- anything excessively authoritarian and pro-life won't be welcomed. Still- suggesting therapy or alternative life solutions to a person who is clearly unsure about what they want to do surely isn't unreasonable (unless the OP makes it clear it's not what they want to hear.) Pro-choice ought to be just that- encouraging people to choose for themselves. That can include presenting them with options to recover and live. This isn't supposed to be a pro-suicide site.

But for that person to then read a post on how a long established member hates all this toxic positivity. How the forum has changed so much. How these disgusting pro-lifers are infiltrating everywhere. That's going to make that person feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. Ok, FC wouldn't call out people specifically but I suspect most people here are smart enough to read between the lines. They may even modify their language in future to better fit in with the sombre tone. Yes- it may be one member saying this but it's a very prolific poster here.

And yes, she's entitled to her opinion and to express it but- pushing for a public, pro-choice forum to effectively become promortalist is going to receive kickback at some point.

So, I imagine that is the larger reason for the ban. This isn't a promortalist or pro-suicide site. Personally, I prefer it that way. I think choice is so important. So- someone that continually bashes anything remotely positive, anything to do with recovery is basically attacking what this forum is because they want it to be more promortalist pressumably.

Also, from what our mods have said, FC received multiple warnings before the ban. If you're warned for doing something that is against the rules and you continue to do it, I'm not sure what else you expect really.

That all said, I do actually hope she is doing ok. I imagine this would have been a terrific blow to her. Like so many of us, she clearly really values this place even though she may have said she didn't. I do feel terrible for her situation and how she feels but- rules are rules at the end of the day.

For a forum as controversial as this, they are probably the only thing keeping it going! Imagine if there were no rules! Open access to minors, free sharing of sources, no recovery section, a total ban on anything positive- we can now only agree with a person's wish to die. How long do you think the forum would last?!! We kind of need some balance so as not to be a death cult I would argue. Plus, some people genuinly aren't ready to CTB yet. They may well be torn between trying to recover or suicide. They need a space to be able to talk about how they feel too.

Just as those who find FC's views too extreme probably should just put her on 'ignore', she probably ought to have ignored the people she found too 'toxically' positive rather than going after them- all be it in an indirect way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

At the end of my life I try to avoid it.

But it's our fault: humanity.

If society were interested in better content, there wouldn't be so much crap in the mainstream.
We prefer empty and quick dopamine injections instead of interesting and developing content.

The Internet is also a perfect place to vent your frustrations. This is not always possible in real life, so we do it online.

This thread was made only for the SCUBA method.
For other inert gas methods please use the other threads.


************


Since my post regarding the SCUBA method in another thread, there have been many questions regarding this method
in several threads and by PM. That´s why I made this megathread.

For some people this method may sound complicated, but it´s not. Basically, it is nothing more than using diving equipment
by replacing a diving gas cylinder with an inert gas cylinder by using an adapter.

In addition to using the rubber mask version, I would like to introduce another, more comfortable version of this method.

Both versions have been successfully used for suicide. Which version you prefer is your decision.



Guide for the rubber mask


Required equipment

- 5 liters helium or nitrogen with a purity of at least 2.8 (99,8%) or higher
- cylinder adapter for connection to the regulator
- full face rubber diving mask (sold with the brand names Poseidon and Pegasus)
- diving regulator consisting of pressure reducer = 1st stage, hose and mouthpiece = 2nd stage (e.g. Cressi MC9 compact, as shown in the photos)

Advantages of this method

No shortness of breath and no feeling of suffocation, as CO2 continues to be exhaled.

Inhalation of pure helium or nitrogen that is not enriched by exhaled breathing air (with oxygen and CO2).

No risk of failure due to uncontrolled movements during unconsciousness or slackening of the muscles and a resulting change in body position.

Helium and nitrogen are odorless and tasteless.

No danger to other persons due to escaping gas.

Unconsciousness occurs very quickly (only a few breaths).

Death occurs after approximately 3-5 minutes in painless unconsciousness.

Technical explanation

The pressure in a full 5 liters helium or nitrogen cylinder is approx. 200 bar.

The pressure reducer, which is connected to the gas cylinder, reduces the inhaled gas down to 9 bar.

The second part of the regulator, the mouthpiece, regulates the pressure further down. This allows you to breathe normally.

These pressure adjustments are automatic and do not require manual control.

The mouthpiece operates according to breathing demand. This means that gas only flows when breathing in. If there is no inhalation or exhalation
at all, the gas flow stops automatically and the exhaled breathing gas is led out of the 2nd stage of the regulator (mouthpiece) via a membrane.

As a result, the exhaled gases (CO2 + O2) are never mixed with the gas to be inhaled. This also reduces the amount of gas required, because gas does not flow permanently.

To connect the regulators pressure reducer to the helium or nitrogen cylinder, you need an adapter. The type of adapter depends on the gas used but also on the country.

Before you order the adapter, you have to decide which gas you want to use.

Adapters for EU and some other European countries (not for the UK):

adapter for helium:

diving cylinder G 5/8"" internal thread - helium W21.8 internal thread

adapter for nitrogen:

diving cylinder G 5/8"" internal thread – nitrogen W24 internal thread

Procedure

First connect the adapter tightly to the cylinder.

After that connect the pressure regulator tightly to the adapter.

To check if the pressure regulator is properly connected to the cylinder, press the button in the center of the 2nd stage while opening the cylinder. You will hear gas coming out of the mouthpiece. Then release the button. Check if you hear gas coming out of the adapter or pressure reducer.
If not, everything is ok.

Caution ! Never open the cylinder without the pressure reducer (1st stage) being connected to the cylinder !
Due to the high pressure, the cylinder could empty quickly or the remaining amount of gas might not be enough.

- If you don´t want to proceed now, press the button in the center of the 2nd stage again and close the cylinder tightly. Release the button.

- If you want to proceed follow these steps:

Try on the mask without the mouthpiece/2nd stage. If necessary, adjust the straps precisely. Check that the mask fits airtight by covering the mouth opening with your hand and inhale. If the mask sucks against the face, it is airtight.

Take off the mask.

Insert the breathing part with the mouthpiece into the mouth opening of the mask.

Sit down in a comfortable, safe position.

The following steps must be done quickly:

Take a deep breath and hold it.

Quickly put on the mask with the breathing part and put the mouthpiece in your mouth.

Continue breathing normally. You will be unconscious after a few breaths.

Another author of a smilar guide recommends to remove the mouthpiece. I don´t agree with this.
If you become unconscious, you could close your mouth. Nasal breathing is difficult with this mask. However, with the mouthpiece in the mouth,
you can still breathe.

Improved version

Instead of the rubber mask and the regulator consisting of 1st and 2nd stage, you use:

- OceanReef full face mask Neptune III (or Neptune III Basic) or OceanReef Neptune Space G.divers each with integrated 2nd stage

- OceanReef Neptune 1st stage SL-35/TX regulator consisting of 1st stage, hose and connector

- and the right adapter for the inert gas cylinder in your country

https://i.sanctioned-suicide.net/images/2023/01/161640_Neptune-III-rel-2.0_EN_3.pdf

For both versions important to know: There are regulators with a DIN and INT connection 1st stage !

Usually in every EU country you can order an inert gas cylinder and adapter on the website of the dealers. Only in Switzerland, Austria and the UK it´s a bit more difficult but possible. Start with the gas cylinder and adapter first before buying the other equipment.

This guide is for your information only. I do not encourage you to use this guide and this method. You act on your own responsibility.
---

I generally don't recommend posting sources for inert gas or adapters on the forum anymore, because the authorities who read this forum might inform the dealers that their address is being shared on a suicide forum. The same thing could happen as with SN or N sources.

Asphyxiation by helium tanks in car,2563655,PleaseLetMeMakeAnAc,"Jun 16, 2024 at 11:21 PM","You can buy it for ~25 bucks for 5 cubic foot at a lot of common stores too; No problem at all sourcing it. I plan to do this while zonked on some DXM, courtesy of robotablets. One final trip. It should also make panic a non-issue cause I think I could sit through a tornado on that shit without flinching.

My plan is to prep my car tomorrow morning with some air exhaust holes in the floor & some basic sealing with tape on the windows & cracks. Reasoning being that the helium should fill the cabin from the top down & force out the heavier gasses. Head to the store & grab the helium tanks. They come with balloons, I plan to fill those with just plain air & use them to reduce the total cubic footage of circulating air in my cabin.

Then wait for nightfall, get a nice pizza from that nice place down the road, & drive out somewhere peaceful. Bring my headphones put on a good yt playlist, crank the AC on recirculate, take my pills, open the valves on the tanks when I start to peak, and lay back & enjoy.

If I manage to still be conscious after a certain point, I will plug the floor holes up with some wine corks I have. This as a backup hoping the AC air flow won't drain the helium out somehow before I pass.

I think this should manage to be more pleasant than the other setups I've seen for asphyxiation; Since you aren't confined to a mask strapped to some tank. And you don't have to source all that mess; It's just basic helium tanks you can buy cheap anywhere

I wanted to share for discussion & make sure there are no holes in my reasoning/methods here. My car's cabin is fairly small & I figure making the cubic footage even smaller with air balloons should make 2, 5 cubic feet tanks of helium plenty. Open to feedback here",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asphyxiation by helium tanks in car,2563743,Kapsyl,"Jun 17, 2024 at 2:37 AM","Welcome to the forum! I see you have put quite a bit of thought about this, unfortunately I'm uncertain it will work.

Is it ordinary ballon helium? Some manufacturers have lowered the helium purity especially in USA, the biggest and popular brand is only 80% helium (Ballon time). Some claim 99% helium but this is a figure I don't really trust since consumers can't really test it.

You're thinking right by displacing the car volume with balloons but it's still a relatively big area to successfully exchange from air to 0-5% helium atmosphere. How many tanks are you're going to buy? Nobody has really tried this what I know of but I would figure you would need something like 5x the amount of helium than the volume of the car. Remember you have to remove all the existing air inside the car then maintaining that atmosphere for at least 15 min. For reference it takes around 10 min for the Sarco pod until unconsciousness and thats with a significantly lower volume and an air tighter vessel to begin with.

Ordinary ballon canisters doesn't have any easy way to determine the amount of flow, if you just open the valves at a rough estimate the gas may run out before the inner atmosphere is below 5%. You would need a flowmeter and a huge supply of continuous helium to ensure the atmosphere keeps at 5% or lower. Remember helium isn't toxic, its lethality comes from replacing the oxygen keeping the body from its vital components to live.

You mention 5 cubic foot helium canisters, that's only 140 liters each, for reference I have a 1000 liter supply of nitrogen for my enclosed mask setup which is only filling a fraction of the area than you're attempting.

There's a good reason why we choose enclosed spaces to fill with inert gas, because it's much easier to ensure no air is getting in. It takes around 12-15 min to ctb in a near 0% inert environment, if that figure is closer to 5% it takes longer, 6% even longer etc. This is normally not a problem with small enclosures but with a car, 10 min extra could mean another 1000 liters of helium to simply keep out the air and ensuring low % atmosphere inside the car.

You mention running the AC while attempting this, in my opinion it would be better to not circulate the ""air"" you want the helium to rise to head level and stay there. Blowing around the air would mix it needing even more helium than not doing that. Taping any vents and doors were air might getting in would be wise.

If I were personally to attempt this I would get a supply of at least 5000 liters or more of helium, a regulator and flowmeter to control the amount of helium. Tape the car everywhere air might getting in, and fix my body so I can't fall down and keep my head leveled as high as possible since there the helium will form.

My bleak prediction of your attempt with two 5 cubic cylinders is that nothing is really going to happen. It's simply too little helium to effectively push out all the air inside the car and keep it out for long enough to successfully ctb. What's probably going to happen is your going to wait for the helium to take affect but after 10 min the cylinder is going too run out and you will be disappointed. Even if your were to loose consciousness, you would wake up when the cylinder is empty.

These are my thoughts of your method, good luck!",2563655,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asphyxiation by helium tanks in car,2563780,PleaseLetMeMakeAnAc,"Jun 17, 2024 at 3:59 AM","I need 5x the volume of the car in helium? Please give details I'm confused on that. I have a very small cabin; It's an old single cab, tiny little thing. <20 cubic feet not couting displacment of seats or cargo. I was planning on getting 10-15 cubic ft of helium

Giving it some more thought after reading your thoughts, you are probably 100% right. I need to rethink this completely.

The tanks I saw are certified to be at least 85% helium. Multiple sources state that they are typically 90%+ in reality. I have a very accurate scale I could use to test the content by working backwards from the force of buoyancy; That seems extra though.

Now I'm thinking: what if I got a box, cut out the bottom, suspended over my seat via string & some adjustable hitch knots, placed it over my head, & filled the box with the hellium. Shouldn't this be like when you place a cup upside down in water and the air stays in place i.e. effectively the same as a closed system?

Then I could maintain it by having the two tanks barely open so that they last as long as possible. I could use a big box to minimize the effect of my breath forcing helium out. Could this make it possible to maintain low enough oxygen levels long enough to ctb you think?

I should mention I do have something else working in my favor; I have terrible lungs. Very damaged from past ctb attempts were I aspirated. I should be more much vulnerable to hypoxia than the average Joe if my knowledege there is right",2563743,,,,,,,,,,,,
Asphyxiation by helium tanks in car,2563808,Kapsyl,"Jun 17, 2024 at 4:48 AM","Well as I said no one has really tried with a car so we have no references on how much is required. But as a car is not nearly airtight as something like a Sarco it's hard to calculate since we don't know how much air is getting ventilated or sipping out. If you only have 10-15 cubic ft of helium in a 20cubic feet car it wouldn't even be enough to push out the existing air inside the car nonetheless keeping it out. The helium isn't going to stay inside the car by itself, it needs to continuously be replaced to keep outside air getting in.

The pph advice that inert gases needs to be at least 97% but most would argue at least 99% pure to be effective. 85-90% pure isn't good enough, you might become unconscious but risk serious brain damage since the purity isn't enough to kill of the brain cells. Using low purity inert gases is highly risky and likely to fail, especially with low amounts of inert gas.


Not sure, every time we take a breath a vacuum is formed which sucks in air. My fear is that you would suck in outside air underneath the box hindering you from becoming unconscious. If you would manage you typically breath at a slower and weaker rate, which could allow you to ctb but it's highly uncertain. What would happen to the box when you become unconscious? We typically fall over when unconscious so keeping the box leveled onto the head can be difficult. Cardboard boxes also aren't airtight. To repeat myself, to be able to ctb you have to be inside an atmosphere with less than 5% oxygen preferably 0-1% oxygen until you successfully ctb. If you use to little pressure the overpressure won't be enough to stop the air getting in, so using to little isn't good either.

It just sounds like a worse version of the exit bag.


I've read that exit bags aren't good for people with weak lungs, I don't really get why but it's something I've read have to come back to you on that.

I'm unfortunately both in a hurry & quite broke buying proper supplies is out of range for me.

I read the PPH & that thread. I didn't see precise numbers on purity. They vaguely mention available helium being at an unreliable purity.

This is probably a really, really stupid idea but what if I actively destroyed/removed the oxygen? Say through fire or some other chemical reaction? Would then using <97% be viable you think?

I don't necessary have to do it in my car. I could do some setup in my house.

TotalOxygenPerecent = ((TotalCubicFeet * PercentAir) * PercentAirOxygen) / TotalCubicFeet

Assuming my math is right, that is 4% oxygen by volume. Warning: I am kinda bad at math

According to ChatGPT, anything <10% is immediate danger and 4% will cause near immediate unconsciousness & death within 6 minutes or less. Studies on this I've skimmed were pretty hard to parse, but ChatGPT's estimates seem to be about right given what I could understand

If this data & my conclusions are right, exposure to 80% helium should be enough to ctb effectively & peacefully so long as you can maintain it.

My new plan is to make essentially an airtight boxfort that I can mount ontop of my mattress with a volume of <10 cubic feet, drain the 15 cubic foot tank into it, and peacefully ctb.

I'll I use a box to give myself an area around my head & torso for comfort, then have an airtight plastic drap around down it that will create a pocket of helium that will stay stagnant around me as I lay down and breath it in.

More than that, I wonder if I could use fire to exhaust even that last 4% from it. Maybe have some little contration with a contained flame that I could place into the box with me & light to burn it all out? Gonna give it some good thought & make sure to take my time",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Look into nitrogen, which is still available but harder to get, or argon, which is much easier to obtain. The most important difference is that argon is heavier than air and nitrogen, so it tends to sink quickly. Thus higher flow-rates are recommended. If one could release enough argon in an enclosed space, and lie on the ground, a mask may not even be needed as the argon will be pooling up at the bottom of the confined space. This is speculative based on the properties of argon, I haven't heard of documented cases where this was used deliberately to CTB. But accidental, peaceful deaths have occurred in this manner in industrial settings.

Argon can be easily ordered in various sizes from online vendors, pre-filled tanks shipped to your door, but you have to sign when the are delivered. 40cf, 60cf, 80cf tanks and more are widely available.

Iv also found a 400L tank which is 14 cu ft, more than enough.

However as there may be a risk that I either remove the bag myself after passing out of that it gets ripped or torn from any convulsions I was wondering about some way of adding a timer to the gas flow.

This would allow me to drink and smoke until i pass out, and then after im asleep, the gas would start flowing by itself.

How would I make a timer device or where i would get one?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adapted Inert Gas Method,2582465,waterworks,"Jul 2, 2024 at 11:28 AM","I honestly wouldn't rely on such a system, never even heard of one. But if you are worried about convulsions, tightly tape the gas tank to a heavily object like a desk or steady chair that won't topple over. You can easily purchase straps from amazon, that you can use to strap yourself to a chair, arms, chest and legs. I wouldn't advise drinking liquor to pass out because there is the chance of you puking into the exit bag which can mess everything up.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adapted Inert Gas Method,2582557,Kapsyl,"Jul 2, 2024 at 12:48 PM","Are you technically inclined and have 400-800$ to spare? Then yes, but it wouldn't work with an exit bag and would take a bit of manufacturing and assembling. As waterworks said alcohol is a no go because of the vomit hazard.

Equipment required are
Full face mask
3 way ball valve
Servo which is time operated.
Hoses and hose clamps

The full face mask is required because of its ability to exhale co2 and keep a tight airseal regardless of your sleeping orientation. It also needs the ability to breathe regular air when you're awake which wouldn't work in an exit bag.

I've excluded the scuba/scba methods out of simplicity since it would require a high pressure 3 way valve and higher quality connections which are points of failure. I also don't think they're necessary since you already be asleep so comfort isn't as high of a priority then it's normally.

So that limits you to a continuous flow full face mask setup, preferably with a reservoir tank. This will allow you breath normal air at atmospheric pressure when awake but switched to continuous nitrogen flow when asleep.

To make said switch to nitrogen I suggest a 3 way ball valve which is servo driven on a timer. You would need to manufacture a steady frame to mount the valve and the servo since these valves need some torque to operate.

The valve would be outfitted with barb on the nitrogen end, but the connection to the mask would require some sort of adapter since full face mask often have a bigger connection than 6/8mm.




How you would operate the servo on a I'm not actually sure, either by directly connecting it to the shaft or with gear/belt reduction. The timer to activate the motor I'm also unsure about. But I'm sure there are some way to program a simple timer which activates the servo somehow. Be aware that the servo needs to shut down when it reach it ends so a simple on off switch may not be enough.

I could probably do something like this to my setup, but i would rather make a conscious decision to go.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adapted Inert Gas Method,2582566,jahjoe,"Jul 2, 2024 at 12:58 PM","I like the idea of the full face mask as opposed to the exit bag.,
I saw an old post earlier from gasmonkey with his set up in a lawn chair.
which inspired me to write this post.

my main concern is the unconscious removal of any bag / face mask.

Iv tested the oven bags, but they feel flimsy.
the vacuum compression bags are a lot stronger and designed not to break under suction
plus they already have a one way valve installed.

Also what tubing do you need for the gas, would a garden hose suffix?",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Adapted Inert Gas Method,2582593,Kapsyl,"Jul 2, 2024 at 1:12 PM","Gasmonkey used a scba system which is 1000$+

Removing the bag involuntarily is really only a concern up to the moment of total unconsciousness. When you out you're not doing anything else then going limp which why straps are used to secure the body.

If you're concerned about removing the bag/mask before unconsciousness which i have recent experience with I can recommend straps/handcuffs.

Garden hoses are often to big and not suitable, you need something like compressed air tubing which is common and in the right size in hardware stores.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Adapted Inert Gas Method,2586029,Kapsyl,"Jul 5, 2024 at 8:33 AM","Depends on how well disciplined you're, for me SI took over that very brief moment just before total unconsciousness were I wasn't thinking straight. I don't even remember how I removed the mask only that I was suddenly standing, staring at the wall.

So to be clear all this happened before total unconsciousness, a few more seconds without interference would have rendered me totally unconscious. The handcuffs would only be necessary for those brief seconds of non coherent thinking, no more.

The unconsciousness introduced from cerebral hypoxia is strictly a resource saving mechanism. Consciousness requires a lot of oxygen, so when introduced to low oxygen environment the body responds by shutting down non essential parts of the brain. Focusing on maintaining the vital body functions like breathing and heart rate.

What I experienced was likely my body's fight or flight system. A last ditch attempt to remove me from danger, solely based on my knowledge of the finite end ahead. Since this response is purely cognitive, it only last for a few seconds between total determination and unconscious.

The necessity of straps or handcuffs can be debated, but after unconsciousness their only use is the keep the body in a fixed position.",2585556,,,,,,,,,,,,

The more I look into Argon, it seems that due to its heavier weight, it has a tendency to settle in a pool at the bottom of confined spaces. If one released sufficient argon in a confined space, and laid on the ground, it might bypass the need for having to build and rely on an exit bag. I don't think anyone's actually tried this yet, but it might be worth looking into further. In this case, no headgear or mask or body restraints would be necessary.",2585556,,,,,,,,,,,,

My suicide note.,2588605,emdout.,"Jul 7, 2024 at 3:45 PM","The blade of a guillotine will fall, and my angel wings shall be severed with it. Those beautiful, shadow-stained wings will disappear. These angel wings are the last hope. I will live and die by those wings. I look forward to that falling of the guillotine, but, for now, I can only mimic that graceful elegance with a razor.

Life is often a razor's edge, and that's the most hurtful part of it. Life can (and will) stain you red with blood, just as the very same razor I use to stain myself red with that crimson, exhilarating blood does too. I do it to feel anything else besides the relentless, unending apathy.

I guess a few words can describe how I feel right now: Freak, pathetic, worthless.
All of those also happen to apply to me too. I really should not be alive; I know I don't deserve to.

Maybe this is just an unending ouroboros of hatred, suffering, vanity and a frightening shallowness. Again, all things that I have.

Worthless doesn't really describe it very well; I'm less than that. All this self-destruction is just taking a toll on me, and I don't want that angel to be in my heart anymore. I just want the world to be as cold and dead as I am.

Black, White. My manipulative tendencies combined with the duality of the world makes it a chess board. Black and white squares, and the pieces that I move.
I personally prefer the red of blood, though, it's much more colourful.
This is the final scene of the act.
For the curtain call shall come, and the painless extrication of my wings will soon follow.
Shadows shall be stained with blood, and blood shall be stained with shadows, and I shall return back to the loving embrace of whatever hell I came from.

There is a quote, from Ozymandias: ""Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair, for I am Ozymandias, king of kings"" That vast, endless desert of ruination is exactly what I wish to become, and my shattered wings shall sink into the apathy of obscurity.

Often, when I write of wings, I write about infinite, pearlescent colours, for that angel that was once in my heart. My wings, however, are only beautiful insofar as they are an infinite symbol of that ruin.

That ruinous beauty.

The angel in my heart is dead. And I killed her.
Goodbye,
Seraphine.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Dilemma with set date,2588555,Beyond_Repair,"Jul 7, 2024 at 3:19 PM","I just found out a close family member is having an important ceremony very soon after my CTB date later this month.

I'll be honest this family member has not always treated me well, and I do have some hard feelings towards them, but at the same time I don't want it to seem like I'm doing it out of spite, because I'm not. But my original date works really well…

New approach: I don't deserve to be happy otherwise I would be,2588307,ChildrensITV,"Jul 7, 2024 at 12:04 PM","My life has been shit for over 25 years, but wasn't GREAT before then. I have had glimmers of it having potential but it always blows up in my face. Anytime something good happens, there is like a ticking-clock sound that I can hear in my mind and soul, knowing that it will be over shortly or that the good thing will end up hard to manage until it's not good anymore.

I've recovered from 2 major suicidal episodes in the last 1.5 years. I was just getting over the 2nd one and then another thing went wrong. Luckily, I'm so used to things going bad that this time, the impact was muted somewhat. What I've taken decades to realize is that, why things keep going wrong in my life is cuz they were never supposed to go right. I was never actually meant to be happy. For some cosmic reason, I don't deserve to be happy. Please don't give me this ""everyone deserves happiness"" cuz apparently that is not true. It would be nice if everyone could be, but life is not nice for many. For many, it is a sick joke that won't end until life ends.

Me, trying to be happy is like squeezing a somewhat squishy square peg into a round hole. It just won't fit. It seems as if you can squish it in but ultimately, it won't fit.

It's so hard for things to work out well cuz they were never supposed to. I am trying to shoehorn happiness into a fate that doesn't allow it. So I will just accept life as being for my suffering and depression. I'm not going through depression: I am supposed to be depressed. I was BORN to be depressed. This is supposed to be my life. I was supposed to live of life of learning, yearning and sadness. This is why I can't break free.

I don't need to HELP my life be shit though. By eating food, I am complicit. I need to find a way to cut down on food. I wish I could be pro-ana and just waste away. I fucking hate this life. I can't wait til it's over. Thank fuck you get only one life. The best day of my life is to come. My deathbed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Some people have brains that are designed to make them miserable. They didn't deserve it, it just it what it is.

so this is NOT an incitement to suicide, everyone does what they want, I just speak for MYSELF what I think I am doing, ME...

. I think that to force me to jump I will swallow 16 g( or more) of paracetamol just before which will kill my liver.
I know that if I don't jump, I will suffer a lot throughout my life from the consequences
of this action...
So I will be forced to jump, unless I experience this horror. I will be in panic and give me strengh to jump to avoid dolor.
Jumping will be the only solution to avoid suffer of a destroyed liver.

I definitely advise against this method because some people could swallow it and still not kill themselves, which would make their lige very difficult. so not to do...!

the goal is just to be more afraid of what can happen after terrible if I don't jump than of the jump itself which lasts 3 seconds and as the height is 60 m, I have a good chance of killing myself and die instantly...

Right now, it seems like a relief to say that because you might be anxious about jumping, and not so much about the overdose, because you've decided on the jump being the main thing. But I think in the moment, it will feel just the same when taking the paracetamol. I also really don't advise this, as there is so much you can convince yourself of in the moment no matter how resolute you feel you are, and if you do take the paracetamol you'll be forced to live in a world of hurt.

But, to have the imminent threat of pain would be frightening and quite possibly enough to initiate a more desperate action.

It's just so awful though really. Everyone here is here because they have suffered enormously. It kind of pisses me off that we have to suffer this much at the end too.

Do you know how quickly paracetamol OD takes effect? And, do you know what the symtoms are? That would be one concern. Whether the onset of pain is so quick and debilitating, it may actually prevent the physical attempt. I don't know though.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am unsure how to advise others on what company I went to, but I searched on google, and tried a few. They all required company details, some more than others. But one has come through, gladly

Additionally, I ordered some SN from a website that sells it, for ceramic glazing. They ship from Bulgaria. I was able to get enough SN from there as well, at a far cheaper price. It's at 97% purity, so should be effective.

So now I have enough SN, and will gather the other items needed.

So in summary, two ways to get your SN that worked for me in the UK

1. A company that sells to UK businesses, and use your company details to buy

2. Order from website that sells ceramic glazes,",,,,,,,,,,,,,

i haven't posted in a bit but! i lost him and he's blocked me so. what do you do when no one understands you? when nothing will replace him? you don't!

my only happiness is my friend and i'm glad i have him so im not lonely before i go, ill try lie to him that im okay and talk to him and update on here when my time comes up, i dont really know if i should make a note or not but i think i will and then update on that post about his SN goes if anyone's interested ^^

my friend took SN his live tweets said it tastes horrible and salty and he felt he brought the wrong stuff but i think he only had the SN without any pills so it would've been way worse.

if anyone minds answering tho; should i stop talking my antidepressants before i CTB? i was thinking of stopping the day before so nothing stops it? but please let me know if you know !

i'm very excited to update you all so i can hopefully make my life a bit useful and make SN less scary for someone!

But today they usually give Suboxone/Buprenorphine instead. It's safer and has a cieling effect, so it doesn't give much of a high (as well being able to prevent overdoses).

Need help locating carotid arteries!,2580124,Rashmika26,"Jun 30, 2024 at 9:11 AM","I need help locating my carotid arteries because i've figured out thay the reason i'm not hanging successfully is because i've not been compressing them successfully, i'm going to do a partially suspended hanging (hopefully tonight) can someone help me find the fuckers",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need help locating carotid arteries!,2580154,Ash,"Jun 30, 2024 at 9:32 AM","Fuckers is the right description! They're just to the sides of your windpipe, set far back in your neck. Everyone's biology is different but if you make a C or U shape with your thumb and forefinger over your voicebox and slowly push into your neck, you should feel your carotid pulse with your forefinger. Be patient and calm and be prepared to keep adjusting the position. You might need to lie down or sit up. Once you've found one, keep your finger in place and put the finger of your other hand right opposite to locate the other.

Hope that helps",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need help locating carotid arteries!,2580572,Rashmika26,"Jun 30, 2024 at 4:29 PM","Once i've found them how exactly do i put it into practice? do i get into position with the rope and everything to hang, press down on my cartoids and then pass out, and suffocate and die while unconscious? Or is the ligature meant to compress them because it just closes in on my whole neck evenly and i cant pass out? Thanks!",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need help locating carotid arteries!,2581020,Ash,"Jul 1, 2024 at 3:09 AM","If you're doing partial suspension, you'll pass out if the rope presses on the carotids, which is why you need to know where they are so you can position it above them without compressing the windpipe.

If you get a sort of fade to black sensation, you've got the carotids.

If you feel your head swelling, you've hit the jugulars. You'll still die but it's a grim way to go. Stop and try again.

This is the most common reason why partial fails. The jugulars, disposing of deoxygenated blood from the brain, are easy to access. The carotids are hidden deep as they carry fresh oxygen *to* the brain. That's why they're so important in life as well as death.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need help locating carotid arteries!,2581081,Justnotme2,"Jul 1, 2024 at 4:28 AM","In fact, are the arteries located deeper than the trachea? It turns out that you need an object-a rope that will look like a human hand, because it is moderately soft and moderately light? During the grip, the arm bends around the neck so that the muscles are bent and enter the neck..

And since there is no such rope, you will have to find something to put on the arteries...

I hate how difficult it is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need help locating carotid arteries!,2581127,Ash,"Jul 1, 2024 at 5:53 AM","Yes, they are located deep in the neck as I said above but no, if you're going for partial hanging, you don't need anything extra to press on them. You're thinking of the ""night night"" method. It's about getting the rope in the right position. It can be done but, as I said, it's tricky. I hit them successfully in a trial with the rope looped but not anchored, again when I was interrupted, and a third time when my knot failed. Each would have killed me and it was painless to the point of unconsciousness. Hitting the jugulars, however, is horrendous and enough to make me stop each time. If you put something on the rope, it will move as the noose tightens, rendering the object redundant and possibly getting the way, allowing enough oxygen to get to your brain, keeping you alive and maybe in small enough amounts to cause permanent brain damage. Genuinely do not recommend. If you want to press on the carotids with the body and all accessories staying still, check out the Night Night method megathread, as I mentioned above.",2581081,,,,,,,,,,,,

Need help locating carotid arteries!,2588368,Ash,"Jul 7, 2024 at 12:52 PM",Jugulars are at the side of your neck towards the ears. Carotids are in the centre on either side of the windpipe. Maybe use a pen. X marks the spot and all that?,2588364,,,,,,,,,,,,

Choosing the Best Sodium Nitrite for the SN Protocol: A Comprehensive Guide,2555227,SpeciesB-9,"Jun 10, 2024 at 3:34 AM","I have found three good sources for SN in Poland where you don't need to provide proof of what you need it for. However, you will need a shipping service that can send it to your country, as these companies only ship within Poland. (At least they did not want to ship it to my country.)
The Sources are BM, W and B.

I talked to my old neighbor yesterday about sodium nitrite. The guy worked as a chemist for 38 years. I simply said I wanted it for curing meat.
All information provided without guarantee.


Recommendation:
For conducting the SN protocol, where the purity and safety of sodium nitrite are crucial, the sodium nitrite from W is likely the better choice due to its classification as ""czysty do analiz"" (analytical purity). This classification provides additional assurance regarding purity and consistency.

What is Analytical Purity?
Analytical purity means that a substance is pure enough for accurate scientific analyses and experiments. It ensures that the substance contains no impurities that could distort the results. Substances with analytical purity undergo stringent testing to confirm their composition and purity.


Key Points:
High Purity Level: The substance consists almost entirely of the desired chemical compound with minimal impurities.
Stringent Testing: Extensive quality control tests are performed to ensure purity standards are met.
Essential for Precision: Critical for accurate and reliable results in research and laboratory analyses.
Analytical purity is especially important in labs and research facilities where even minor impurities can lead to significant errors in results.

What are Anti-Caking Agents?
Anti-caking agents are additives used in powdered or granulated materials to prevent the formation of lumps (caking). They ensure that the powder flows freely and is easier to measure and handle. Without these agents, the powder can clump together due to moisture or pressure. It's important to note that clumping does not affect the quality or purity of sodium nitrite. Before use, clumps can be broken up by sieving or gently crushing them back into powder form.


Comparison of Suppliers:

W:
Purity: 98%
Description: ""czysty do analiz"" (analytical purity)
Anti-Caking Agents: No specific mention of the presence of anti-caking agents
Advantage: Analytical purity, which is crucial for precise applications
BM:
Purity: 99%
Description: ""czysty"" (clean)
Anti-Caking Agents: No specific mention of the presence of anti-caking agents
Disadvantage: No specific mention of analytical purity
B:
Purity: No specific details found about purity
Description: ""czysty bez antyzbrylacza"" (clean without anti-caking agent)
Anti-Caking Agents: Contains no anti-caking agents
Disadvantage: Lacks detailed information about actual purity

Conclusion:

Therefore, W is the most suitable choice for the SN protocol due to its analytical purity, followed by BM with high purity but no specific mention of analytical purity.
B has the advantage of containing no anti-caking agents but lacks detailed information about its actual purity.


I hope there is not too much information to find the sources on the internet.

I have another chance at happiness but don’t want to ruin it,2588239,anon7245,"Jul 7, 2024 at 10:31 AM","Its been roughly 9 months since I got broken up with by my first love, and all 9 months I've been going through immense emotional turmoil, to the point of thinking the best logical choice was to ctb. But i found a new partner. Completely unexpected, she liked me the moment she saw me and I guess a part of me did too. We've been dating for less than two weeks but it's been great, I'm more honest about all my dark secrets than I've ever been with someone, we've had sex almost everyday since we started dating, seen each other everyday and can't wait to see each other more. But of course there's this lingering feeling one has to have which is, when does this end? To put it in reference she is very beautiful, out of my league entirely. And I struggle with self esteem due to the weight gain I received from my break up (over 50 pounds, was down 20 but the relationship caused me to gain 5 pounds since we're going out to dinner so often) and I know my weight is the biggest thing holding me back from being labeled ""decently attractive"". I'm planning on losing weight because I want to look my best with this person. But my life is just at the point that a relationship is both a blessing and a curse. I'm really happy right now, and look forward to the future. But a part of me thinks I should just be alone, work on myself with nobody else around so that I can properly exist in said future. I don't think my partner would willingly hold me back but I think their presence will do so, and in turn they'll resent me for it. I don't wanna lose this person because I can't be who I'm meant to be, but idk if they'll stick around anyways. Do I really break up with this person who I fell for hard (as of right now she's definitely much more in love with me than I am towards her) to work on myself (physically, and career/education wise) or do I attempt to juggle both, go through financial struggles going to school, and not going out on dates because I want to lose weight and those sorts of things. I feel like I'll make her miserable which is an awful decision on my end. I know in the future when I obtain these things we would be perfect together, and even right now we both make each other happy even if I'm at my lowest, but how long will she really stick around? Idk. I need help on deciding what's in my best interest, and hers I suppose. I'm finally happy, and know I'll be even happier in the future. But there's gonna be a risk of complete devastation, I could be overthinking (I've mentioned this and she says she's willing to be with me through all my problems but naturally one has to be skeptical, especially since she barely knows me outside of all my secrets I've dumped onto her)",,,,,,,,,,,,,
I have another chance at happiness but don’t want to ruin it,2588264,Apathy79,"Jul 7, 2024 at 11:02 AM",Seems like a no-brainer. You can go to work on yourself with her in your life. The awesome young love infatuation period you're in doesn't last long. Enjoy it. It's the perfect position really. You've got all these things internally you want to improve because you don't think they're up to scratch. And she loves you anyway despite them.

The only people who are still in my life are here because Im in some sort of fwb with them. My bodycount literally doubled in the last few weeks and it makes me feel so worthless to the point I wanna ctb. Even my girlfriend called me a whore for that (didnt cheat in her, we are both polyamorous), and I really dont care what happens to me anymore.
Because of this Ive started to use sex as a form of sh, which makes it feel a bit better. Even when everything on my body is covered in scars, they still fuck me, and I dont understand it to be honest. I try to make myself as unattractive as possible for others, but they still think Im pretty.

Feeling unworthy/like a slut,2335738,siouxsie,"Jan 29, 2024 at 4:05 AM","I really don't have much advice here. But I feel you. I feel the same thing, even though I'm married. I'm pretty sure if it wasn't for the sex, my husband would have left years ago. I also am covered in scars and have a very low bmi, so I'd assume most people of whatever gender would find me unattractive. Yet wherever I go I find people hitting on me. I don't get it either. Apparently I give off vibes that tell people I'm easy. That's what my husband tells me at least. I don't get it. I look like shit and I sure don't flirt with anyone yet everyone seems to think I'm like some fun new toy. It's annoying and makes me feel like I'm merely a piece of flesh. Before I was married I too used sex as a form of SH. So sorry, I can't help but I sure can relate.
And I don't know if this is of any help to you, but when I read this my head went like ""oh, classic borderline personality"". I'm diagnosed bpd and the whole sex thing is part of the diagnostic criteria. I also have a lot of bpd friends, and it seems that all of us seem to attract a lot of people even if we don't intend to. And usually, it's the wrong kind of people. We're like magnets for narcissists, other personality disorders and a bunch of other mentally ill people who end up making our lives worse. Story of my life. Not much I can do about it. It's a neverending circle. Meet someone, they'll promise u the moon and the stars, be abused, break up and break down, repeat. I've come to the point where I'm thinking that accepting that I'm merely a sex toy is better for my mental health than trying to be loved for anything other than my reproductive organs.

I recently discussed suicide IRL and still no one has connected the dots,2549496,Sakura.,"Jun 5, 2024 at 8:51 AM","Recently in class, we were supposed to give a presentation on any topic of our choice. I don't have any passions or interests, so since I couldn't come up with any ideas in the months leading up to the presentation, I had to choose the only topic I knew about, which is suicide.

If choosing such a topic wasn't suspicious enough, I included a series of theses in my presentation that completely deviated from the common views of society on suicide and what pro-life psychologists write about the topic in their scientific work.

I said, among other things, that the tragedy is not suicide itself, but what drives a given person to commit suicide. And that, therefore, suicides should not be prevented for the sake of prevention - only to then leave such a person without help, alone with their tragedies and problems, or lock them up in a psychiatric facility.

II discussed (again - completely differently from common views or the views of pro-life psychologists) the characteristics of suicidal tendencies, the individuals experiencing them, and their attitudes and behaviors, which may (intentionally or unintentionally) signal to others that they are experiencing such problems. All this information related directly to me!

Finally, I raised the thesis that suicides should not always be prevented and that they can be rational. That if the decision to commit suicide is mature, well-thought-out, considered for an appropriate amount of time...
...and if a given person meets certain conditions - that his or her life is suffering, not necessarily due to, for example, a fatal disease or chronic pain, but also for other reasons, such as mental disorders , trauma, social maladjustment - they should have the right to leave...


///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


I always thought I was a clear case of a suicidal person and that it was extremely easy to see how much I am struggling and suffering. But either everyone is so insensitive that they don't notice it, or they notice it but don't care at all.

One might think that my presentation, in which I indirectly revealed my suicidal problems, would be something that would trigger a realization in some people, leading them to change their attitude towards me or even offer me help.

However, this did not happen. Even though I obviously revealed my tragedy, no one noticed it. There's probably not even one person who noticed, but just pretends not to have noticed it.

No one was interested in my suffering. Not only did no one discuss this topic with me directly, but they did not even offer indirect forms of help, such as talking or spending time with me.

The most interesting thing about the whole situation is that a significant number of people participating in the class are... psychology students, the vast majority of whom will become psychotherapists in the future. I'm not convinced, to put it mildly, that they have the necessary predispositions for recognizing and being sensitive to another person's suffering...",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I know. Still, when a person with obvious mental issues gives a presentation on a topic like suicide; when they says that when someone has mental problems, suicide can be rational and should not be prevented and so on... It should be a bit suspicious to others.

I don't want to get my hopes up that such people exist in my case. I understand that for someone these problems may be so difficult that they cannot help me with them, and I do not blame them for that. I would still really appreciate that they noticed them and that they cared about me, even if they can't help me.

No.

I checked the legal regulations. General, public posting on SauS, addressed to an unlimited audience, is not a crime.

It is a crime to interact with specific people, including helping them implement their plans (e.g. by sharing knowledge about methods or giving opinions on them), and potentially also expressing acceptance of their plans (which may be understood as actively encouraging suicide). It is also a crime not to inform state authorities that someone has suicidal problems.

However, my views on suicide alone are enough to lock me in a psychiatric facility if they are revealed and to close off various opportunities for me regarding professional development, adoption of a child and a number of different things.",2549594,2549597,2549601,2549609,2549608,,,,,,,,

I personally noticed that most ordinary people just are not as aware of mental health problems or being suicidal. Probably they don't even want to be confronted with the topic, so they will just block that input and try to forget it as soon as possible as a prevention, to save themselves to dive too deep into the thoughts of suicide. Most people still do not like to be confronted or reminded of death, the way or reasons do not necessarily matter. Basically they blind themselves to see the truth cause they can not handle it.

If you want to be heard try to talk to a therapist or any kind of mental health person and explain your situation to them. You have better chances of getting support and having a good listener then.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It may seem controversial and disrespectful to others who have cancer and it destroyed their lives but that's what makes me feel like it's fair. I want to die and I cant seem to do it myself, I'm losing hope that I'll ever be fully ready. And cancer is a great excuse to kill myself! I might very much do it in such scenario. No one will blame me. And there are so many innocent people who die from cancer every single day and they want to live!

Recently, I've started the diagnosis process for my eye and yesterday I was on MRI scan of my head. I got the scans and of course it all looks like a pulp and I'm nowhere near doctor lol, but I found some elements that kind of look like they have potential to be a tumor.

Its always there. At least when im laying/relaxing somewhere.
Its slightly distracting.
It never managed to make me reach climax or so.

In the grand picture, we are meaningless, mere atoms in the tapestry of the universe - whatever happens in our lives makes no difference in the very end. But I don't think this holds up on the micro level. To the system around us... friends/family if we have these, but if not even just neighbours, animals, the general public etc., our actions do have influences on a real level. I think if we blindly followed the logic conveyed in the book we could justify horrendous and immoral acts - just because in a million years we and nobody currently alive will exist, does that make it okay to commit a heinous crime? I certainly don't think it does. And I think the flip side of this, if you agree anyway, is that if we're capable of causing harm and that seems to matter to us, then we're also capable of doing good, and this should also matter, regardless of whether it's a mere drop in the ocean in the bigger picture of things.",2588122,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really just wanted some physical release and to be able to sleep well for a bit, and I thought that bleeding sounded really relaxing. I'd read online that it's helpful to submerge your arm in ice water for about an hour to numb it so that you could cut. The problem is, your arm gets red and swollen and you can't see the veins anymore. I'm pretty thin so usually the veins are super clear.

So that was frustrating. Currently waiting for more ice to freeze to have a second go at it because I definitely missed lol. Advice for anyone who wants to do this -- maybe trace out your veins with a sharpie first so you'll still be able to see it.

You can do serious damage by putting your arm in ice water for an hour.

You can do serious damage by trying to cut a vein lengthways.

You can do serious damage by accidentally cutting into muscles, tendons or nerves.

If you want to do it, go ahead. I assume you're an adult and able to make your own decisions. But don't encourage others to follow your lead by suggesting this as a credible resource when it's nonsense that could land you and others in hospital with long term or permanent injuries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

just i was probs an abonormality to infections i didnt take care at all but its easy to risk infections u wont be able to use hand and arm if infection gets into the nerves to damage them

keep area clean and covered dont use dirty blades life is bad enough as it is sometimes u know

u lose blood faster when ur blood is circulating well get hydrated and warm tense muscles compress above to force blood flow u will get better flow and probs safer than just going in forcefully, dangle ur arm down and clench fist a lot u can keep flow up longer for less cutting

I'm in a very similar situation - dealing with chronic and devastating effects from medication that have completely destroyed my life. I completely relate to the feelings of being stuck. It's an unimaginable tortuous situation to be in - on one hand I love life, despite going through really tough times, I always saw the beauty in it, the potential for change and growth and joy. The feelings of loss over not being able to experience these things anymore due to something as stupid as a medication feels suffocating and leads me to a very hopeless place. But then I realise no matter how much has been taken away from me, there is still some tiny, miniscule things that remain, and knowing that death will take even these away from me leaves me feeling unsure and even more trapped. I find myself facing an unanswerable question - continue living facing the devastating grief and loss of what my life could and should have been, but recognise there are still things I can be grateful for (I can see, I can walk, I can still read etc.) or decide this is the end of the line for me and take away the pain and loss, but also these small things that I still have. Groundhog days sums it perfectly.

One thing I try to remind myself is that even if my health doesn't improve, how I perceive and relate to it might - but it's difficult when this is very unknown.

The only advice I have is to just breathe, one day at a time, you're doing your very best in such a hard situation, take time to figure things out.

Sorry if it feels like I'm using this thread as a journal, just figured I might as well document the week rather thank making new threads but luckily this is good news. So, today, it stormed like crazy (unfortunately I did get pretty wet), but it suddenly became a thunderstorm and per our company policy, boats cannot be sent out for a bit after we hear thunder. We had a delay and they learned it was going to continue so we were let off extremely early, I mean it was only 2 hours into our shift. So I spent the day with family, enjoying a festival. Now I'm back home, chilling before I will inevitable go to bed and go to work again.

The main downside of them cancelling today might mean a larger number of people tomorrow (the company naturally issues rain checks for anyone whose reservation was cancelled due to weather, which was about 50 people today). I'm unsure how many people would have moved it to tomorrow but I imagine it's a very likely scenario. Tomorrow, either way, is likely to be a very busy day regardless, so we shall see how that pans out. Either way, only exactly 3 weeks until I leave this job, and starting next weekend (July 13th), I will be gone for a week until July 20th, so I will not be working for 1 of those 3 weeks at all! My time is coming to a close and I couldn't be happier, I don't like working lol.


Thank you. Even though my shift was cut extremely short, I still intend on watching an episode as soon as I'm done typing this, because it was still a workday and I really am enjoying the show. Then again, waiting might make me anticipate it even more tomorrow! I don't know which I will do, but I will choose soon.",2586600,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well I run at least 6 miles every morning after waking up, I have to do it to counteract my depression and never ending despair so I can remain functioning since I can't ctb yet. Apart from the 6 miles, I have to eat a healthy diet that consists of home cooked meals, again this helps me counteract the misery.

Whenever I fail to do these two things, that's when I get worse and spiral out of control, so I have been awake all night thinking about some of the people that have passed, users like Mimi, pancake, and onelegman.

I can't believe onelegman is gone, he had a hell of a story, made a timeline and stuck to it, it's very impressive. MiMi was a kind soul and extremely brave, I am sad I never got a chance to talk to her before her time run out, I hope she is at peace, and then there was pancake, her goodbye thread really got to me, my eyes welled with so much tears they couldn't stop flowing down my cheeks until the next day, she was so strong, so determined, and incredibly brave, I hope she got the peace she was seeking.

Anyways as I think about them, I remember that I will be joining them soon enough but until then I have got things to check off the bucket list and I gotta live my last summer, so soon the sun will rise and I will go on a 12 mile run to exhaust myself so I can be able to fall asleep again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes absolutely, the reason you won't die in a modern-day vehicle in a confined space is because the catalytic converter acts as a CO scrubber.

Remove the catalytic converter or just cut the pipe that immediately precedes plug to the catalytic converter and you have straight up pure exhaust.

You can actually purchase gas canisters of highly concentrated CO typically used for calibration of CO sensors, but with the cheap price tag if you buy two or three and allow all of them to be off gassing inside a vehicle cabin, then the probability of hypoxic injury and death are very high within minutes, and 100% with liquid nitrogen spelled in the vehicle cabin death is painlessly instant at 6% oxygen levels for 8 minutes of exposure to a nitrogenized confined space.",2540174,,,,,,,,,,,,

Death by nitrogen hypoxia is easy, it just need to buy a $150 Dewar for 10L of LN2 (cheaper than bottled water) and quickly decanted inside of a vehicle or confined space. With nitrogen having a 1 to 700 liquid to gas evaporation rate, 1 L of liquid nitrogen or 10 L of liquid nitrogen would be 700,000 L of nitrogen gas or enough to displace 24 or 13.3 square cubic meters which is about the interior volume of a typical sedan.

However, this is of the not reported to prevent copycats or fruit to become a mainstream method.

Golfer Grayson Murray Suicide By CO,2553630,DeadManLiving,"Jun 8, 2024 at 5:59 PM","The idea came from Dr. Death's (Phillip Niteskite's, excuse spelling) a death pod which uses pure liquid nitrogen to fill the death pod as it confined space. Liquid nitrogen is easily available at all major welding shops, ice cream supply shops and major industrial gas suppliers.

The method requires a confined space like a bathroom where you can pour the liquid nitrogen in the bathtub or in the tent say and by using a heating element having it evaporate quickly and laying as low as possible since cryogenic nitrogen sinks due to its temperature, 10 L of liquid nitrogen in a hotel bathroom would probably be able to displace the oxygen in the entire bathroom and by lying down you would essentially be nitrogen blanketed, a term used in industry to protect critical infrastructure, which is essentially sleeping or laying in a blanket of 100% pure nitrogen gas. Let's get also be done in a tent, but be careful to not blow it up use 15 Liters and set the ventilation vents so it flushes out all of the oxygen for prolonged time.

And how confined of a space is a bathroom? It seems that that's way too big of a space with cracks everywhere that the gas could escape.

The reason the inert gas method isn't my #1 preferred method is because the setup seems so complex for me that I'd worry I'd fail. Also, I'd worry that my SI would kick in a breath or 2 in, and that I'd be able to take the mask off before I went to sleep but suffer permanent brain damage.

Golfer Grayson Murray Suicide By CO,2588045,Not A Fan,"Jul 7, 2024 at 5:56 AM","I found a dewar for sale that is quite portable but it only holds 6 liters. It sounds like anything less that 10 liters might be insufficient, but the size of this thing is perfect... not like the huge barrel used by the guy in the video you posted ""How to buy liquid nitrogen"". Something close to this size would much easier to transport and handle!

Perhaps 6L would enough to use in a small tent.

I did not realize they could be this small. Probably a container for 10 or 12L wouldn't be too bad either. For some reason all the ones I've seen so far appeared much larger. They would definitely draw attention.


Perhaps you could seal off the openings in your bathroom? Probably only a good idea to do if you don't live with anybody else. But if you can measure the cubic feet of the bathroom interior, you should be able to determine the number of liters of liquid nitrogen would be required.

If you live in the US liquid nitrogen seems trivial to purchase. The setup doesn't require figuring out the mask and regulator and putting these various parts together. It seems relatively simple to just seal a small area and pour liquid nitrogen into wide, exposed container in the confined space and let it expand. It will expand to roughly 700x its original volume. As a precaution, one should use a few extra liters over the minimum calculated requirement.

You're basically pouring liquid from one container into another and breathing the air around you. In cases of accidental death from liquid nitrogen exposure, people lose consciousness so quickly they don't even realize what happened.

I have a car but it sounds even better to do this in a nice tent somewhere in the wilderness.

Edit:

Notably, you can only store liquid nitrogen in one of these tanks for a limited amount of time. I guess it eventually evaporates. See ""static holding time"" in the image below:",2545662,2554204,,,,,,,,,,,

To my family:

I'm sorry it had to end this way, but I couldn't bare the pain anymore. Everyday feels the same. Life to me is a miserable, endless, monotonous cycle. It is my time to go. Although I've burned all my bridges, if there is an afterlife, I'd like to rebuild them. On the note of me being a miracle baby, I don't understand it. Why would God give birth to me just to die? I defied him and then I got punished for wanting to live. I get punished for wanting to be a normal human being, it's not fair. I love you all, I truly do. I just wish life had treated us all better.

To Cousins:

You guys are my best friends and I really do love y'all from the base to the apex of my heart. Through the ups and downs, I'll never forget our shared memories and experiences. I must move on

To Siblingsk:

I'm sorry that we never got along. I felt that everyone was stuck in their ways and I wanted to change. I wanted to break the habit of just smoking and drinking. I also think that y'all can't handle anger well, I hate being around yall when y'all are angry, not something I feel comfortable with. I wish we all got along better and had more in common, I know I'm the odd one of us 4. Please love each other and take care of yourselves.

To Mom and Dad:

I love yall both. I wish I had more time with both of y'all. Please take care of yourselves and the rest of my siblings. Maybe my death will keep everyone closer together. I was the glue that held the family together, now it's your turn to fill in the gaps. Please take care of yourselves and take time to grief, I know losing a kid isn't easy, be kind to yourselves, it's not anyone's fault. I love you both

About my stuff:

Please take care of Me-Mow for me. If you cannot take care of him then please surrender him to a shelter, he deserves a good life. The password to my phone is @&^#. Most of my passwords should be in a Google doc on the google doc app. Please feel free to go through my phone and tablet, maybe I'll give you insight on the real me. @(*&^ can have my laptop and any other electronics besides the tablet, mom can have the tablet.

I have modified it from my previous post. And will this work as a reliable alternative compared to DDAMPH? I can't source the morphine & phenobarbital.

Fast 8 hours

1. Meto 3x10 mg on empty stomach

2. Wait 40 min

3. Tagamet-400mg.(?) Wait 30 min.

4. Drink crushed up Ami 9g in water
(using oral topical anesthesic in mouth, tongue
and drink with straw to help with bitter taste)

Wait 20 minutes? Too long?

5. Take 450 mg Diazapam, 15 mg Lorazepam (crushed in little water)

6. 3x20 mg Propranolol (slightly ease anxiety)

7. 4 shots of vodka

8. Lay back on right side

What do I do if I vomit? Minimum Ami needed in body to likely cause the cardiac arrest? And should I take some of the diazapam before the AMI to relax me?

Peaceful, fast and reliable?

DDMA asked for 8gm of Amitripyline. Amitriptyline increases the heart. Propranolol decreases the heart. I don't know what's the effect of mixing both. If you vomit, the PPH book recommends to stop the attempt. (While with SN, people on this platform recommend to have another glass handy). The PPH book lists AMI as a peaceful way to go but there is no associated protocol.

The problem with religion is that you identify as a Christian, you look at the state of the world as a Christian. You look through the lenses of your community and you are pressured by it.

There are no Christians afaik. These are just labels needed in order to communicate between themselves. Like even your name isn't yours but was given by your parents. The very name someone made up before and is shared by other people too. You feel me? If you negate your name then who are you? You can deny Christianity but can you deny your existence? It unfolds naturally.

If Christianity is true then there is no obligation to follow it. There is no need of getting an antoher label. It will unfold naturally.

From reading your post, I wanna say that I am sorry for your situation. It sounds tough, I can appreciate feeling the need for a sign to give you strength.
I think many people struggle with the calling. Those with it tend to exude a sense of unshakeable faith that most tend to want.
From what I can tell, humans need proof, some kind of evidence that they are on the right path. Not everyone gets that calling, and that is okay. We find strength in what we can. We're Human.
My father was a devout Catholic, he never pushed his faith or beliefs on anyone, but every day he prayed in the morning, and evening. Always went to church, prayed and then left. I think adhering to that gave him strength, whatever he said during his prayers allowed him to carry on with his day despite what happens.
From a layman's perspective and experience, religion is old, complex, and just a massive sprawling culture.
But, most of the folks I went to church with came to listen to the pastor's witty jokes and stories.
They came for the comfort of community and understanding. They went every Sunday, Saturday, or whenever for the after mass snacks and conversation.
They didn't go to adhere to centuries old traditions or to tithe. (No one likes having the baskets shoved into their faces)
They went to sing hymns, laugh, pray, and meet their besties for an hour or so.

If Christianity isn't working in the way it is for you, it is okay to change. It is okay to pick the parts that will work for you to give you the strength to carry on if that is the path you choose in life.
Spirituality and Religious legalism aren't the same thing. I'd advise you to rely on the members of your community that will understand, if you feel comfortable.
Not everyone has found their faith, and not everyone has had a perfect life. In fostering a sense of community with those who understand, you might be able find God's grace in it. And if not, that is okay too.
It is nice to know that there are others around you who understand. Also, many parishes, and churches will have programs that are designed and often led by people who have personal experience with situation like yours. There is no shame in asking for help when you need it. A lot of us who look to religion are damaged and vulnerable too.

You could look up the problem of evil (or suffering) to see if you find any of the counter-arguments convincing.

I think one of the main arguments is that God gave people free will, so it's up to them now, because intervening would be a violation of that free will. From a scientific point of view, free will probably doesn't exist, and personally I think this is an unethical (and kinda lazy) way to treat your creation. I know a lot of people who have lost their religion and faith in God because they were in a similar situation and struggled with this dilemma. If you're part of a religious community and everyone around you is Christian, this can be really difficult.

This is just some unsolicited advice, so feel free to ignore it, but perhaps you could approach it with as much openness and curiosity as possible. Share your doubts with your close family to hear what they think, ask these questions at your church (leader), learn more about atheism and its arguments, explore other interpretations of the Bible and branches such as liberal Christianity.

Be really sceptical, because the Bible is filled to the brim with the most bizarre things, but also acknowledge the good things (e.g. Jesus) in it. I think it would be really unreasonable to look down on you, especially if you approached it with this mindset.

Avoid bitterants in compressed gas duster?,2324208,DeadManLiving,"Jan 21, 2024 at 7:19 AM","For what you are looking for exactly is liquid nitrogen. It is an inert gas that fails to activate the body's hypercapnic alarm response system and you pass out within the breath or two without any sense of suffocation or panic.

Because it is so cold that cryogenic temperatures spilling a little in a bathtub or on the floor will create a cloud of vapor that will linger and rise from the bottom up and displace the oxygen, one of its greatest hazards and the cause of a multi-casualty 14 peaceful death Cascade incident at a poultry plant where a worker passed out after a leak and another went into rescue becoming a casualty, then the third going in to rescue both becoming the third casualty, and then bodies piling up on top of each other until the fire squad cold and evacuation and had to go in with scuba equipment.

The costs are they're cheap. All you need is a $150 cryogenic Dewar container and then filling it up with liquid nitrogen at your local welding supply shop, ice cream supply shop for industrial gas supplier at anywhere from $1 to $4 a liter, cheaper than bottled water. You will need PPE, specifically cryogenic gloves for $35 and a face shield.

You could also do it in a vehicle cabin as long as you plug your aft trunk over pressurization vent so when you spill the whole 10 L the vehicle essentially becomes a hyperbaric nitrogen chamber and death becomes instant within 4 minutes as the O2 concentration drops to less than 3% resulting in coma in a minute and death within three.

In another embodiment, you could decant the liquid nitrogen in a very well weatherproofed tent.

Both a tent and vehicle cabin will have a confined space volume of 30 cubic meters or 24 Square cubic feet. 1 L of liquid nitrogen expands to approximately 700 L of nitrogen gas, and so you could only imagine the liquid to gas expansion coefficient would create quite a deadly plume of vapor that would displace all of the oxygen and composite atmospheric air in a confined space that would expel out through any opening exhaust vent as the LN² rapidly evaporates from liquid to gas leaving behind only 99% nitrogenized atmosphere lethal within a few breaths or two.

If not a confined space, the shallow drowning technique would also apply since liquid nitrogen vapor will basically stick to the ground in a low hanging fog comprising pure nitrogen. Multiple casualties and children have died after some full some liquid nitrogen in a pool party and people swimming in the pool or basically killed like flies instantly as they were deprived of oxygen while the liquid nitrogen converted from liquid to gas and swept through the pool, no screams or cries were heard because there was no suffocation just passing out and I'll try this post the link when I can find it.

I'll come back and edit this post with a video and some pictures.

It is a vacuum insulated container and the only type that can contain LN2 in a liquid cryogenic state for storage. You would need at least 10 Liters, unless you have some other method of shallow drowning yourself in a pool of ultra cold nitrogenated or nitrogen blanketed space. There have been many reports on industrial accidents where the density of nitrogen was sufficient to overcome any exhaled residual CO2 and or presence of oxygen, but you're mean concern would be not getting frostbite. In fact your major concern would be not getting found timely, where you would be rescued only to possibly be in a persistent vegetative state due to the hypoxic injury however the window of probability is very low humans can live without oxygen > 5min but that would be entering coma not death.

You would need a confined space or you would have to let the nitrogen pass through some kind of a heat exchanger or set of tubes to reach room temperature and continuous flow. If you could build some kind of contraption like that then you'd have almost 700,000 L of N2 flowing in a purge across a mouthpiece if you can tie yourself down and strip everything correctly so nothing goes wrong when you lose consciousness and motor function.

As @JOkE2109 mentioned, the liquid nitrogen method has its pros and cons and its hazards. It certainly effective in lethal if you know what you're doing but it is either highly restricted or no pun but a joke to get in the US lassie faire states countries. So if you're in the UK or don't have the funds or resources to set up a shell company, then your best bet would be your local college laboratory. Maybe enroll as a student student and you will certainly have unlimited quantities of LN2, although I'm not sure how controlled it is but it certainly is in many parts of Europe. In the United States it's a joke to get - I'll post a video of how easy it is, for god sakes this family could have died the way they procured it (coming up when I find it).




In India you can get is easy to my knowledge based on a few peer accounts. If you have the resources and will there's always a way, sometimes a harder way sometimes you get lucky and find the easy way.

Death by LN2 nitrogen blanketing in a confined space should have a good quantity source in a well controlled environment. Much more difficult to control liquid nitrogen than N2 gas. But I suppose if you dump it in a hole and inside of a tent in a sufficient quantity like 20 L worth and brace yourself face down as it comes upstream, then is that should be considered a 99.9% lethal rate especially if you plant deterrents to rescue such as modded pressure cookers or a / b particles that are detectable with Griger Countets or warning of lethal booby traps if the perimeter is disturbed.

That would impede rescue by dozens of hours if not days untill they fly in a special HazMat team.

Suicide in Islam,2586284,EscapeFromLife,"Jul 5, 2024 at 1:43 PM","I am a muslim having faith in Islam as a religion. In islam, it seems to have been said: ""Suicide is prohibited by Islam. It is haram—forbidden. The logic behind the prohibition is that it is an act that manipulates something, in this case life itself, which is meant to be only God's concern. Furthermore, it indicates lack of trust in God who is capable of making things better.
Suicide is a major sin , and the one who does that is faced with a warning of eternity in the Fire of Hell, where Allah will punish him with the means that he used to commit suicide.""

Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ""Whoever throws himself down from a mountain and kills himself will be throwing himself down in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever drinks poison and kills himself will be sipping it in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever. Whoever kills himself with a piece of iron will have that iron in his hand, thrusting it into his belly in the Fire of Hell for ever and ever."" (Narrated by al-Bukhari (5442) and Muslim (109)

Jundub ibn 'Abd-Allah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: ""A man among those who came before you was wounded. He panicked and took a knife and cut his hand, and the bleeding did not stop until he died. Allah, may He be glorified and exalted, said: 'My slave hastened his death; I have forbidden Paradise to him."" (Narrated by al-Bukhari (3276) and Muslim.

Islam clearly forbids suicide as a verse in the Quran instructs: ""And do not kill yourselves, surely God is most Merciful to you."" — Quran 4:29.

I personally feel that even if I am eternally in Hell Fire after dying by suicide, that is better that each passing day now where every moment is worse than hell. So, I don't mind going to hell, although I would like to land in heaven sometime. I thought of not trying suicide because of the fear of hell fire a while back, but things are just not improving. So, I need to sacrifice after-life's peace for reducing current life's pain.


What are the thought of others, especially muslims, in SaSu about facing this punishment for suicide?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why does god not create humans exactly the way he wants them to be and a perfect world? That's not a big deal for an almighty being.

What religion does to people is give them a form of comfort. So they don't have to ask those difficult questions.

The human body for one is a joke, disease, disability, mental illness,

Unfair genetics some people are born genetically gifted - strong, athletic, or very intelligent, Attractive. Some people are born crippled, low iq or just not attractive. How is that supposed to be fair or just?

Human nature is disgusting, look at history. War, greed, racism, s3x predators, pedos, violent criminals, bullying. Our species is absolutely vile.

Your parents

Suicide in Islam,2586934,landslide2,"Jul 6, 2024 at 5:06 AM","I am an atheist but come from a family that believes in god. If you truly believe in god, there is nothing anyone can say that will help other than to try and convince you that there is no god or judgement.

I will share that most people who are born into a faith, never truly conscientiously accept that faith. It is something passed down from generation to generation and absorbed to varying degrees. You could have been born into a christian family, a hindu family, a jewish one or one that doesn't really ever go to church or one that is ultra orthodox. One could ask why would god add this additional hurdle of being born into a non-believer family? Which is not so small if you think about it. Of course that would be one of many questions, if you are willing to ponder, some of which others alluded to in their posts.

One aspect that seems to get absorbed is fear. If you don't do the right things, then punishment awaits. As a child, this aspect tends to seep in and stick around. Whether you want to cbt or not, that fear is something you will have to reconcile with. I can only say what others have said, that all religion is of antiquity, and that even if you do believe in a higher power, that times then are not the times now. You will have to decide how literal your belief is. It's hard to believe that even a judgmental god would see fit to keep a soul in a forever limbo of pain, which to me seems pointless, meaningless for someone with so much power. Humans, sure. Humans come up with horrible things and actually put them into practice. but an omnipotent being that has control over this entire universe and multiverse? I dunno, it doesn't make sense 'to me'.

My family members say in islam, diseases are examinations by Allah of His servants. So, maybe the pain we suffer on earth is due to Allah's examination. But, even then if the pain is unbearable, it makes sense to me to CTB. Just like it makes sense for most of the people to fail a really really hard examination.

As for why I want to CTB because each and every single moment feels like hell to me now. I have not been able to do what I should have done in my life so far. This gives me immense shame. Thus, I do not feel comfortable talking to anyone now or socializing. My friends and classmates have progressed in their lives in all aspects personal and professional but I have not. My family members are also aware of my hopelessness and helplessness, and I feel very ashamed talking to them. They give me false ""hope"" like things will get better, etc, but things have not gotten any better– my feelings have only gotten worse. Thus, CTB is important to me on an urgent basis, as it will solve all these issues, and liberate me. I lack the skills, experience, connections and qualities needed to do better than my friends, relatives and classmates at this point. Waiting for the future is harder as every moment that I am facing feels like hell. I simply cannot tolerate the reality now. So waiting and not rushing to CTB is not an option for me.

First, what kind of god would condone this?! Secondly, so most of humanity is going to hell? ! I told one of my Christian friends that I thought god had a poor track record. He asked what I meant. I asked him so god created every one and everything, correct? He said yes. I asked him so every one who isn't a Christian is going to hell? He said yes. I asked so all muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, native Americans , agnostics and atheists and believers in any other religion are going to hell and he said yes. I said so gods got a really shitty track record because he's torturing most of his creation. He had no answer.

As long as you're surrounded by them you're going to be under the control of a pervasive superstition.

If you were in hell and you could get out just by checking out wouldn't they try to tell you how bad suicide is? Of course they would. It's the ultimate gaslighting!

"I'm so pathetic, aren't I?",2587852,SpiderMolt,"Jul 7, 2024 at 1:26 AM","If someone gives me attention that means they care about me, right? The attention makes me feel special, even if I'm being treated negatively. I've had ""friends"" that would constantly put me down, make me feel bad about myself for no reason. But that didn't matter because they would still call me their friend. I had a ""friend"" who would hurt me physically. For some reason none of that really mattered to me. To be honest, I kinda enjoy being treated like that. I like being told I'm not good enough and that I don't deserve friends. I really liked when the insults got personal because that ment they cared enough to actually notice all those insufferable things about me. I know I'm just a sick in the head masochist. But whatever I guess.

Whenever I did anything that upset them, I always felt like I had to beg for forgiveness. I didn't want them to hate me, or worse, abandon me. I would've probably been okay with them hating me as long as they didn't leave me. Y'know? I wanted to be around them so badly that I couldn't even realize the damage they did to my mental health. I was the one who felt bad when they made me cry. I mean, I probably deserved it, right?

The funniest part is they still leave me. I'd do anything for them, and anything for their attention. Sometimes they'd go on a rant about how horrible I am and then block/ignore me, or they'll go straight to ghosting me. I don't know why this keeps happening to me but I can't take it. I'm so scared of upsetting people and being abandoned by them.

I have a really hard time putting up boundaries because I'm afraid it might upset people. I literally ignoring the fact that I'm uncomfortable with certain things because I fear they might be upset with me for it. It's stupid, I know. I'm so pathetic and desperate for attention and I keep getting hurt because of that.

I don't really know where I'm going with this anymore. So, I guess I'll leave it at that :^",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"I'm so pathetic, aren't I?",2587867,Why did they do it,"Jul 7, 2024 at 1:49 AM","Hmm, this one is a toughie.
Coming from a neglected and abusive childhood, I can tell you that I learned how to derive happiness from attention even if it was negative attention. It's so bad to the point of where I actively seek out situations to put myself in to get any and all attention at all.
It is a severe toxic trait of mine that needs fixing if I ever want to be able to be happy, and make others around me happy too.

What I can recommend is that you need to take steps to identify when attention is negative and not allow yourself to seek it or put yourself in situations where it is given. It is hard I know, especially when you feel happy to get any attention at all.
You need to learn how to make a distinction between positive attention and negative attention.

Please be kind to yourself, friend. Tell yourself that it is not alright when you receive abuse whether verbal or physical. Treat yourself well, and others will treat you well too. You're not pathetic, we all need attention. Just need to learn healthy ways to get it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But recently I found why is that. It requires work on your Shadow. Being neglected again is of course a big theme. You don't want that and you are trying to be nice to people.

You can't force another human being to like you or to respect you. Either it's mutual or move on. I already learned that it's impossible to get along with everybody. You find a few people.

You are nice, you are OK, you treat them well but IT IS NOT REALLY YOU. There are agressive vibes that can't find expression.

I found the monster lurking in me. Maybe it even explains why I was neglected by my parents in the first place. I realized I do everything not to see the monster again I once were, yet it's still the part of me waiting for its expression.

I'm so nice but it's fake and people can sense it. You don't want to stay with fake people, it's understandable. Do you like fake ppl? Openness is sexy but you have to recognize people you can open to.

Integration requires to settle firm boundaries, fight back if needed, yell at someone if they're yelling at you. I recently broke some things and yelled at someone and guess what happened? She started to be very nice towards me! Respectful. Like establishing this boundary was healthy for both of us. Anger was justified I believe and no one get hurt. It was so refreshing that finally this emotion found an outlet.

As you can see, 'being nice' strategy failed.

"A Case Against Hell (sorry, i'm bored)",2586771,waterworks,"Jul 5, 2024 at 11:32 PM","It's Friday, I have no friends or plans, and I'm in my bed just thinking, so here are my thoughts, would love to here people's opinions.

1. Introduction

Definitions: To begin, let's briefly establish what's meant by hell. The word hell originates from the Old English hel or helle referring to the netherworld or the abode of the dead. This term comes from the Proto-Germanic *haljō, meaning ""the underworld"" or ""concealed place,"" which traces back to the Proto-Indo-European root *kel-, meaning ""to cover"" or ""to conceal."" To the modern person hell has come to mean (per Oxford Dictionary) ""a spiritual realm of evil and suffering, often traditionally depicted as a place of perpetual fire beneath the earth where the wicked are punished after death.""

History: The earliest recorded use of the word ""hell"" in English to specifically refer to a place of torment dates back to Old English Christian texts, which began to emerge in the late 7th and early 8th centuries. Bede known as ""The Venerable Bede"" (673-735 AD), an Anglo-Saxon monk and scholar, translated various biblical and theological texts into Old English, using ""hell"" to translate terms like infernum (latin. underworld, underneath) and gehenna (hebrew. place of punishment). This Old English translation was rooted in the latin word infernum derives from inferus meaning ""below"" or ""underneath,"" and it was used in early Christian literature to denote the place where souls awaited judgment.

The general consensus is that the then popular understanding of hell was similar to the Greek Hades which referred to a realm of the dead. This word appears many times in the Christian new testament. The old testament had the Hebrew sheol which similarly referred to a realm for all the dead. This later became what in latin was inferus the realm underneath, similarly with hades and sheol.


2. The Sociological Argument Against Hell

I can't really say I have a way to argue all of theology. The goal here would be to focus on the religions that have shaped our views on hell. Which is why I won't be focusing on Islam or Hinduism etc. Mainly Judaic and Christian literature.

2.1 Dante's Inferno

You may have noticed that the modern word inferno has roots in the latin word inferus, referred to earlier. Today, inferno has come to mean a place or state containing a raging fire. Though originally the word had little to nothing to do with a raging fire.

Synopsis: The most significant influence on the modern understanding of ""inferno"" as a fiery place of punishment is Dante Alighieri's epic poem, ""Divine Comedy,"" written in the early 14th century. In Dante's vision of the afterlife, the ""Inferno"" (Hell) is depicted as a series of descending circles, each containing different punishments for various sins. ""The Divine Comedy,"" is divided into three parts: Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise). Many of the punishments involved fire, interpreting much of the biblical imagery of hell as a place of eternal fire and torment.


Overview of ""Inferno"": In this section, Dante vividly describes a journey through nine concentric circles of Hell, each representing different sins and corresponding punishments. The imagery and descriptions of these punishments, including lakes of boiling blood, fiery tombs, and other torments, had a profound impact on popular perceptions of hell in Western culture. But the funny thing is how it incorporates supposedly ""pagan"" mythology into its narrative. For instance, Medusa In Greek mythology, is a Gorgon with snakes for hair, whose gaze turns people to stone. In ""Inferno,"" Medusa is depicted as a terrifying figure in the gates of hell

2.2 Catholicism: The Great Oppressor

One of the great wonders of modern Christianity is the diversity of institutions within it. One could say, there's a church born every day. But how did it go from a seemingly united organization under the Papal Roman Church, to what we see now. In one word Reformation. It was sparked by theological and institutional criticisms of the Catholic Church, particularly regarding issues such as corruption, indulgences, and the authority of the Pope. Key figures like Martin Luther, John Calvin, and others challenged Catholic doctrines and practices, advocating for a return to what they saw as biblical purity and simpler forms of worship.


Rejection of Indulgences and Purgatory: Indulgences , which promised remission of temporal punishment for sins, were criticized for their perceived exploitation of believers through financial transactions rather than genuine repentance. Martin Luther's famous 95 Theses, posted in 1517, denounced the sale of indulgences as a corrupt practice that undermined the biblical principle of salvation by grace through faith alone.

As noted earlier that institutions such as the Catholic Church through centuries have benefited from their tight control over the ""afterlife"", you could say. Through the mechanisms listed earlier, indulgences etc, they somehow managed to keep money in their pockets and believers under their steeples. In the very definitions of the word hell is a rich history of demented imagery that keeps leading back to the same institution.

3. Conclusion

This is one the reasons I don't find a case for hell compelling. The history and motivations that have often surrounded it, speak to a world troubled by manipulation and greed. An institution that dominated the then known world, creates a terrifying narrative to inspire belief. This narrative is picked up by a somewhat popular poet who creates a masterclass in writing that influences an almost global tradition. Every joke, every piece of artistry, every media sensation that borrows imagery from that work, serves to cement a belief that was born to serve an institution we think we are not related to anymore. Yet they still bind us in chains we don't see.",, , , ,,,,,,,,,

And I think the Catholic Church is correct in asserting that sin can plunge you into hell, at least in one respect: I developed severe mental health issues after catching an infection from kissing a person on a one night stand. If you read health forums, you see that many people also developed physical and mental illnesses from contracting something from kissing. So the Catholic were right in believing that sexual promiscuity is a sin, which can lead to hell. It certainly did in my case.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

i'm sorry that this might be a little off-topic, but your post made me think of that. the idea that ""if you think you're in Hell, it's because you are"" really tickles my brain. with that idea, Hell doesn't have to be fire and brimstone; it can be neon lights and office buildings.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A Case Against Hell (sorry, i'm bored)",2586866,EvisceratedJester,"Jul 6, 2024 at 2:48 AM","First off, no. Most people do not develop mental illness from kissing others. That's, in of itself, usually not severe enough to lead to mental illness. I'm not saying that it can't happen but, in most cases, it rarely amounts to anything, especially when done between consenting parties. Also, kissing is a low-risk activity when it comes to STIs and most oral STIs go away on their own, so I don't get why you are so anti-kissing.

Secondly, sexual promiscuity usually isn't in of itself the main cause of most mental illnesses. In some cases, it might be a symptom of mental illness or trauma, especially sexually based trauma, but there are plenty of people who partake in casual sex who are perfectly fine mentally. Consent, safe-sex practices, and not shaming others probably does more to help people when it comes to casual sex in comparison to shaming people and making them feel guilty over something that isn't even that bad.

It's true that certain infections from kissing can cause severe symptoms like that. But sexual promiscuity is hardly the problem, it's unsafe sexual practices. That argument is as absurd as saying, you can contract diseases from shaking people's hands, so don't shake anyone's hand.

"A Case Against Hell (sorry, i'm bored)",2587136,G50,"Jul 6, 2024 at 10:51 AM","At present, science still does not know the cause of the majority of diseases. But there is a theory that nearly all illnesses, physical or mental, are caused by the microbes we catch in our lives. Not of course cold viruses, which are harmless and easily destroyed by the immune system; but rather various other common viruses which are able to persist in our body (Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, coxsackie, adenovirus, etc). These viruses are all caught by normal social contact. If someone has such a virus in their body, if you spend enough time with them in close social contact (such as living in the same home or office as them), the you will likely eventually catch it. But French kissing can speed up the process, since all of the mentioned viruses exist in the saliva, and so the saliva exchange of French kissing greatly increases the chances of transmission.

I am sure you know that mononucleosis (the short illness caused by Epstein-Barr virus) is also known as the ""kissing disease"", as lots of people catch EBV from kissing, and are then hit with mono. Fortunately mono clears up after a month or so in most people. But in others, they go on to get the disease of ME after mono. ME involves lots of fatigue, cognitive issues, and often mental health symptoms such as depression, anxiety, panic attacks, OCD, and others. In the long term, EBV has also been linked to triggering MS later in life.

And that's just one virus. There are dozens of others in common circulation that are caught by normal social contact or French kissing which are routinely passed from person to person. Crowded modern urban environments make things worse, as there are more people around that you can catch things from.

Most of the general public are completely unaware of the connection between common viruses and bacteria, and all the major diseases that afflict humanity. But I would guess the majority of people on this website who are suffering so miserably may have a hidden infection behind their woes.

My life was totally destroyed by a virus I caught through kissing during a one-night stand, as the virus I caught triggered some really nasty physical and mental symptoms. And I know lots of people who had the same experience. It does not mean everyone catches viruses from kissing; you can just catch them from housemates or work colleagues by normal social contact.




Sex itself is probably not as bad as French kissing, in terms of passing nasty infections that may later cause a serious disease. Most infections humans catch enter our bodies by the respiratory or gastrointestinal route, rather than through genital contact. Safe sex can prevent sexually transmitted infections, but not ones transmitted orally by saliva. And of course sex and French kissing usually go together.




Many major religions have discouraged promiscuity and sex before marriage. This includes Puritans, Protestants, Judaism and Islam. Since the sexual revolution of the 1960s, the West now mostly ignores this religious tradition, especially since the arrival of reliable contraception, which has now prevented most unwanted pregnancies. Casual sex outside of marriage was certainly a bad thing in the past, as it led to so many orphans without parents. But now that we have good contraception, as well as abortion, this is rarely an issue these days.

So people these days think recreational sex, when performed with contraception and condom protection, is safe. But a one-night stand they have today could be the cause of the physical and mental illnesses they develop a few years later.




Well, this is something of a philosophical question. But I would say the hell of mental health that I have been suffering for the last two decades is very real. I've prayed for death nearly every day for these two decades, in order to escape this hell. I was a happy person, but I am now a conscious being plunged into continual torment. Only those will severe mental health or chronic physical pain might understand this.

Now, you may say that the hell depicted by Catholics (and other faiths) is different: that is an eternal hell from which there is no escape. And any hell humans experience here on Earth while alive is presumed ephemeral, because one day you will die, and then the suffering will be over.

But if you read the literature of the mystics, they believe that every moment in time also exists forever in eternity. Of course, it's hard to understand mystical ideas. But the notion that my mental torment is not just ephemeral, but will be there for all eternity, is rather scary!

Before suffering from mental health torment, if you had asked me does hell exist, I would have said no. But now I know that sentient conscious being like us humans can be plunged into a very real hell here on Earth. I expect many people on this site would agree. So hell exists for conscious beings; the universe in which we live in can plunge sentient beings into a chronic state of pure torture; but it is hopefully just an ephemeral hell, that death will allow us to escape from.",2586866,2586866,2586866,2587050,,,,,,,,,
"A Case Against Hell (sorry, i'm bored)",2587175,EvisceratedJester,"Jul 6, 2024 at 11:34 AM","A random theory that mental illnesses are caused by microbes we catch in our lives doesn't mean anything unless you actually have good evidence to support it. Along with that, microbes are everywhere. You could argue that plenty of nonsexual non-kissing activities would also thus have the risk of you contracting a disease.

Either way, evidence we have at the moment points to kissing being a low-risk activity when it comes to the spread of STIs and most oral STIs go away on their own. The whole ""but science doesn't know"" argument is one is that is nearly always used whenever people bring up the fact that something is unlikely. Science doesn't know everything, but it does work to provide a proper understanding of the world around us and so far, to my knowledge, the evidence we have gathered shows that kissing is a low-risk activity for STIs.
Okay, then what difference does kissing make if you are still going to likely catch these viruses via normal social contact?
If you acknowledge that mono usually clears up by itself and rarely leads to complications, then why are you so hung up on it? Also, the ME seems to mainly be connected to depression and most studies on it seem to be correlational. It could easily just be a spurious correlation. One study from 1999 even called into question these claims after not finding a significant difference in rates of depression amongst those who suffered from mono versus the general population. Along with that, other activities such as sharing drinks, food, or certain personal items (toothbrushes, lip gloss, etc) can also lead to one becoming infected with mono. Either way, the vast majority of the world's population (90%) has been infected by the virus before and most people are able to live on without any complications from it.
How do you even deduce that it was the kissing that even caused this and not some other thing? You noticing a pattern doesn't mean anything when people notice patterns where they don't exist all the time.

You seem to have a weird obsession with kissing dude. I've never come across someone who is anti-kissing.
Puritans are just protestants and protestantism are just a dominions of Christianity, and Abrahamic religions are not the only religions out there and are very recent in comparisons to many other faiths. There have been countless spiritual beliefs that have existed amongst many different cultures throughout human history, and this includes a lot of sex-postive ones. How different religions and cultures view and practice sex is varies a lot, so I don't get your point here.


You seem to have a weird hatred of kissing and that's fine and all, but please stop trying to make it out to be these horrible act. You can just say you don't like it personally, you don't need to try and treat it as this horrific act ruining the lives of many.",2587136,2587136,2587136,2587136,2587136,2587136,,,,,,,

"A Case Against Hell (sorry, i'm bored)",2587788,G50,"Jul 6, 2024 at 11:18 PM","No, this theory is not just about mental illnesses, but all illnesses. That includes heart diseases, diabetes, atherosclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, ALS, cancers, and everything else. If you take any everyday chronic disease you care to mention, you will find that research has discovered specific microbes living in the diseased organs. So there is an association between the disease and a specific microbial pathogen. These microbes are suspected of causing the disease in the organs they infect, but science has not yet proven this, because that is very difficult to prove. But nearly every chronic disease is linked to pathogens.




STIs are not my interest. Most are treatable.




Isn't that obvious? During normal social contact, you might have to live years with a person before their pathogens transmit to you. But by saliva exchange during kissing, you can fastrack those years to just a single one night stand, or brief affair.




I would not say ""rarely"". Around 5 ot 10% with mono will develop ME, and ME is usually a lifelong condition that can keep you locked in your home for decades, or keep you bedbound in the more severe cases. It's one of the worst diseases you can get.

Plus the presence of Epstein-Barr virus in the body has been linked to autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis. EBV actually lives long term in the B-cells of the immune system, which is why it can screw up the immune response.

And EBV is not the only virus which can cause ME, there are several other, include now SARS-CoV-2.




ME is not depression, these are completely different diseases. ME is a neurological disease, like MS, Parkinson's, etc. As with most neurological diseases that adversely affect the brain, with ME you can get depression, anxiety and other mental illnesses appearing on top of the ME. But ME and its symptoms are distinct from those of depression.




Because I know the person I caught it from, and I was only with them for a few hours, during which time kissing took place. The first symptom I got the next day was a sore throat. Not hard to put two and two together. I then some months later spread the virus to other people I kissed.




Where did I say that? Kissing is wonderful, just as sex is. Nevertheless, educated people are aware that sex has health risks; abd being so educated does not mean that they hate sex. It just means they understand the pros and cons.",2587175,2587175,2587175,2587175,2587175,2587175,2587175,,,,,,

YES! My psychiatrist (whom I truly do love) has suggested 1) fresh air, 2) taking off my shoes and burying my toes in the grass, 3) stoicism, 4) yoga… the list goes on.

In more complex way

When I was young, my family always pressured me to perform absurdly high in math even though I'm bad at math, it got so bad up to a point where they became manipulative to me. They tried and still try to gaslight, guilt trip and even threatening to abandon me just because of my math score. I'm also a weirdo in my childhood and even till this day, I always drawing stuffs and skipped class to read book and even once got stucked on my elementary school's library because it got locked while I'm still inside reading a book. But even with all of that, my parents still pressing me to perform excellent in math. I'm not a dumb individual, I can think, I have my own passions and hobbies and yet my parents kept pressuring me, citing that every job imaginable needs an advance mathematic skill and they also never acknowledge or begrudgingly acknowledge my passions or hobbies. And for someone who think why I value my parents so much? It's because I was young impressionable young kid back then, my only world was my parents only. Now, I'm old but that incident left a scar on me with how I view myself and the world. My parents also extremely hostile when they found out about my self harm scars, they threatened to evict me out, even though I was 15 years old back then. And I also have nobody to talk about, my passions and hobbies are more than complex for the average Joe in my area. Honestly, I don't know much since I had been on under impression of I'm who's wrong here and also because I never speak up or express myself out of shame. I hope I can at least explain my problems, even though it has running for years and deep. My parents are usually aren't that shit but when they do, I hope they die sometime, always acting like they're never wrong and manipulate me into believing I'm wrong, even though they kinda aware of my mental situation. They never embraced me as who I am, and keep on pressuring me to be what they want even though I can't, because I have ADHD.

MtF Im just broken biologically I cant know if everything in my head would actually make life right but I want a child. I want to be a mother. Im broken in the fact im a type 1 diabetic so this body doesn't even perform basic functions to sustain itself. Ulcerative colitis makes this body also tear itself apart. My mother had miscarried 9 children before me, had to have her uterus medically stitched shut to carry me, needed some heavy drugs because the rh factors of our blood were different and her immune system tried to kill me. When I was born I needed to be intubated and the hospital used the wrong size tube and broke cartilage in my throat permanently causing deformation. Being trans and not having my voice from testosterone sucks but knowing my throat was broken too just adds to that. So yeah a lot of biological shit is one of my major issues.

"If you’re serious, act like you’re planning a murder.",2586205,sugarb,"Jul 5, 2024 at 12:30 PM","(Please keep in mind that this refers only to people who are dead-set on CTB. If you're even the slightest bit unsure, do not listen to this advice.)

Suicide is treated as a crime akin to homicide by both the law and by pro-lifers, but despite the enormous stigma and even outright incarceration associated with a failed attempt, many suicidal people both here and elsewhere expect a peaceful path to nonexistence.

While there's nothing wrong with seeking comfort in the time leading up to the end or simply wanting to be happy, the bottom line is this:

The world we are trying to escape views suicide as self-homicide, so to get what you want under these circumstances, you need to plot a first-degree murder of the self. Adopting this mindset brings CTB that much closer.

As for what this mindset entails-

- Treat your victim as an object.

This helps with SI.

Dehumanize yourself. Disregard how their (your) family will mourn, how much it will hurt them. Disregard their future. Disassociate, if possible.

- Do not make any moves until the perfect moment.

If you were planning a murder, would it be smarter to slip a few pills into their drink on impulse or wait a year, buy a more lethal implement like a gun, and do it somewhere isolated?

Obviously the latter. You might only get one shot, so don't waste it.

- Keep up appearances.

If loved ones and doctors suspect something's up, they will question you. If something seems off, or they find evidence, they'll go further. This is inconvenient.

- Do not confide in others.

Specifically IRL, secrecy is of the utmost importance. Your friends, family, therapist, etc (if applicable) can and will rat you out, resulting in a mental hospital stay. It can be very hard at times but it's often necessary.

—

tl;dr- Suicide is stigmatized and punished to the point of it being treated almost like murder. Under these circumstances, the most logical thing to do is act as if you're actually committing a murder. Be secretive, plan carefully, don't do anything impulsive, dehumanize the target, wait for the right moment.

I think the part about planning and secrecy absolutely make sense for people living in countries where it's illegal, and for people living in countries where's it's so heavily stigmatised (which is pretty much everywhere!)

But I also don't buy into the narrative that CTB is murder, and don't want to pretend that it is, even if people around me are acting like it is.

I've never had any plans to murder anyone and don't ever intend to, but if I did, I also wouldn't want to dehumanise them. If that was what it took to kill them, then maybe I shouldn't be killing them. And for myself, if/when I decide to CTB, it'll be to end the pain and suffering of life, and I don't wanna add to that by treating myself like an object.

I also think I'm in a fortunate place where I've spoken to people IRL who agree with assisted suicide as a concept. Some of which I feel able to talk to about the desire, or any plans to, CTB. One of my friends asked me to be their back-up for helping them CTB when they get older.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

"If you’re serious, act like you’re planning a murder.",2586416,sugarb,"Jul 5, 2024 at 3:40 PM","I'm not buying into the narrative, either. I just found it helpful to think ""CTBing is stigmatized similarly to murder, so I should take all the precautions someone who's planning that sort of crime usually takes to avoid being stopped"". I understand how the metaphor could be taken as an endorsement of pro-life sentiments but I assure you it's not. The point isn't to pretend that CTB is murder, but to recognize that the aforementioned narrative is the predominant one and not acting accordingly makes CTB much more difficult.

I shouldn't have said ""dehumanizing"". To clarify- I meant less seeing oneself as an object and more seeing one's body as just an object; a barrier to the end goal, which is to stop breathing. ""I'm going to shoot myself in the head"" is much more upsetting and scary to think about in the moment than ""I'm going to pull this trigger and leave this body"". I don't know if there's a word for that. And I might also be saying something wrong here again

So he's a geek & a snoop & will use what he can against me & it could turn nasty & I'm defs trying to avoid that. He always knows stuff that he can only know from access to my phone or email or whatever so I think he's installed something or just has access to what he shouldn't. I wrote a dummy grocery list on my phone of stuff that we never ever buy & he came home with it all & tried to gaslight me but it was just a test. So I don't know what he knows. But I just cannot, under any circumstances, use any other digital things at home - I don't know enough to hide everything, I don't doubt he's spying on me & will use what he can & I'm a bit scared. I've got zero money & so hadn't looked into getting anything else for myself. But now I'm thinking of just hocking something, even my wedding ring, to get a tablet or laptop. But I need to be smart & be able to hide absolutely everything from him. So I want to steer clear of Apple in case I fuck anything up & it goes in shared cloud or anything. I'm in Australia & want to steer clear of Telstra - that's who we use for home internet & mobiles & such & still on a shared plan. I was thinking of getting a laptop preferably to have a good keyboard or a tablet that I can attach a keyboard - it will be bottom of the range stuff I'm sure, but a big screen, touch typing & saving stuff will be life/death changing. I need this. But because I know nothing, it only just occurred to me that I'd have to connect it to stuff at home - modems & routers & whatever, all of which I assume will be impossible for me to set up without knowing all our details & also easy for him to see new devices or people connected. It had not occurred to me & when it did, I felt punched in the stomach, at such a near miss, out of ignorance. I have limited access to the internet & limited time. I only have one legit excuse I can use at both work & home to go AWOL for a few days & I'm saving that to actually CTB. And I medically can't drive so am limited to what's nearby or I can somehow get & I'm not confident of having anything delivered here. There's a ""chance"" I can get it sent to work but that's not ideal. So if I know exactly what I'm looking for, I can make calls from work, go to what's in walking distance or get a taxi to a one off place. But I need to have all my bases covered. I can't afford to get it wrong. If he sees any evidence of this…. I have one shot to CTB. I want to take full notes of how to test SN, find a rural hotel or caravan park, read the differences between the successful & unsuccessful attempts, come up with a regimen, post it, get people's advice, all of it. But on a iPhone that I'm too scared to open links, can't see a large screen, can't touch type, can't save things on, it's just never going to happen. So what the fuck do I do? I don't know what I don't know. I know it can't be Apple, it can't be Telstra, it can't be anything connected at home, it can't be anything he can see as a nearby user or whatever. I need internet but I don't understand how much I need. I need a laptop or a tablet that can have a keyboard attached. I need it to be cheap or cheap-ish. But the big thing is - is there a way to get a prepaid laptop or tablet? Or a modem? Or anything? Especially something not on an ongoing plan with paperwork, just something I can top up?? Like the old school mobile / cell phones???
What am I looking for?
How do I not get detected?
I'm sorry I don't know any of this stuff & I don't know how to find out when I don't have any privacy or skills & the fear of being caught is so overwhelming. But so is the fear of how long research will take on a phone & what I could miss & get wrong when I only have one chance to CTB. We are still legally married & he threatens calling crisis teams for me when I don't do what he wants - he is a very believable person that looks rational & in control & if I was anyone else in the world, I'd believe him too….it's not good. At all. Any help appreciated. I gotta get this right so I can go. Please help.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I do not know the answer to most of that. Australia had a dumb internet thing called NBN that flopped. I work a couple of blocks from home & we just upgraded everything to 5G & I ""think"" that's what I have on my phone & at home - I know right before the work upgrade, the whole area went out of internet but my ex was still working from home without any issues & I think the 5G was the difference. I'm not sure. I appreciate your response but I will have to google all the things, sorry. If I attempt this, is there any way he could see that there's more or different wifi in the house? Or if I attempt to set up a wifi access point (I don't know what that is…) could I do it wrong & accidentally set up to the house or him in some way? Or is it the kind of thing I could ask people in a computer store to set up for me? Because it's a thing they do often? Because I'm an idiot? Or a service I could pay for in store? Is it that kind of thing? I really am clueless & time poor & scared so I really appreciate the response & I'm sorry for piling on more questions. But the more I learn now, the less I have to chase up & can just make super quick calls from work when no one's around, see if that store does it, if they don't, do they know who does, call them, ask the same short questions, go in, set up & then have proper access to the entire interwebs safely…. I can also then fib that my shifts got extended or I got extra shifts & go to a coffee shop & research thoroughly. Take notes. Plan. Make it happen. I'm hoping to have CTB'd before there'd be evidence of missing pay, or at least I could claim it was a payroll error that I'm chasing up. I think I've only told him one lie so far - I'm not good at it & I have to plan it in advance because if I'm asked a direct question, I'll give a direct answer - this is how I've lived my life & I'm very proud of my honesty & integrity, & it sucks to think I have to give that up at the end of my life, sucks for me, not for him. Lying comes easily & often for him & I didn't know the extent until recently… Sorry, the point is I need as much help as possible to make this impossible to find out - if it's something computer / phone stores do regularly, as a service, I'm happy to pursue. Obviously at the moment, I have neither an android phone or a laptop, so I guess going somewhere that sells both would be my best option?? Instead of going to a phone store? And then a computer store? I thought maybe there'd just be some sort of prepaid option that would exist just for old people to Facebook their grandkids or something,(!!) & I could just do that…",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Without knowledge he's literally a tech wizard. And it's quite common to purposefully be silent about the limits of ones capabilities.
Apple devices are notoriously hard to break into. He most likely just stole your passwords, by looking at you inputting it. If he's very tech savvy, he could then have installed something on it. I think you should use the system you're most comfortable with. Android will not bolster your security (though it's also sufficiently secure).
Realistically this is all protection you need.

With TOR no one will know what sites/servers you visit, but they could see that you're visiting a TOR relay.
With a VPN, only the VPN provider knows what sites/servers you visit. Others could see that you're contacting a VPN provider, though.

Modern basic encryption is something you'll get automatically, and makes it so no one can see what you transmit, even if they know the recipient. Tor and VPNs ensures that encryption is applied to absolutely everything, but it already is on anything important.

Millions of people (including very rich people) do banking online, without knowledge of security. Modern communication is very safe, unless your device is physically breached or your login credentials are shared/stolen.
Use unique passwords to compartmentalize security. You don't want one unlikely leak to give access too all your accounts. Avoid recovery questions that someone else can guess.

I hope that crash course in computer security offers you some piece of mind. Use a new device with a personal account and a new password, and you'll be fine.
Ask in a store for local 4G Internet options.

On a more personal note, you might want to divorce, get your own place, and think things through. CTB:ing while still in a stressful relationship riddled with paranoia, might not be the greatest idea. The idea of just having one chance to CTB is wrong. You'll have many chances, with new ones coming up all the time.",2586916,,,,,,,,,,,,

Tech help - do prepaid internet laptops or tablets or modems or anything??? exist that can be hidden from a digital snoop with shared accounts…??,2587653,DOHARDTHINGS24,"Jul 6, 2024 at 7:48 PM","Thanks. I'm fine using VPN's - I've got opera on my desktop & proton on my phone. I don't know what TOR is. When we split, I changed the passwords to everything I could think of, including my iPhone, all different, none of them auto saved, all handwritten only & stored outside of this house, somewhere he can't access. Got my own appleid, no find my iPhone, no family sharing or whatever. So I did the things I knew how to do. And yet, he still knows things he couldn't know any other way.
My concern is things I don't know. If I just buy a laptop or tablet, I have to connect to the home internet & I can't do that. So what I need to know is how to have an independent internet source, that isn't through an ongoing monthly plan, that I don't accidentally connect to anything of his or that he can see in any way. My decision to CTB is independent of this but it is influencing my time frame. I'd be happy to go tonight if I had enough information to be sure I'd be successful. Part of what I want to research is the difference between successful & unsuccessful attempts. And other people may have a million opportunities to do this, but I believe it to be true that I just have the one chance & need to seize it. I didn't come here to hang around, no disrespect to anyone else, I just came here to get as much help as possible, with the things I don't know, so that I can achieve one thing and soon. There are a tonne of crazy life circumstances that need to be worked around, causing most of the issues. Maybe I'll just block my caller ID & calll a computer store…The digital snooping is real as is the physical snooping - I noticed things out of place so I repeatedly lined different things up in particular ways before work & come home to them moved - in my personal drawers & such where he'd never have the need to be. It's why I've stored a few things permanently out of the house, kept on my person, or wrapped so heavily & hidden, there'd be no way for him to rewrap - it wouldn't stop him opening but at least I'd know immediately.
I just want a safe way to access the internet for a few weeks, not forever, to see this project through, without worrying about what I'm fucking up, what he can see & how he could use that against me - because he would.
Sorry, that only just posted now & I wrote it yesterday but haven't reread... I'm not that fussed if he keeps tracking my phone stuff - if I get that fixed it'll be a red flag to him that I've finally learnt a tech thing & he'll want to know why… Getting my own Apple ID & changing my phone password was definitely a surprise to him that I was questioned about. It's not great here.
And I definitely can't use the desktops at home - apart from worrying about leaving a trail, it's also easy to see from everywhere in the house that you're on it & he often works from home using it. So no guaranteed access & easily seen as soon as you open the door & I can't take to another room or coffee shop. So a laptop preferably or a tablet. And I'll hopefully always be able to keep either of those items hidden or offsite & with unique passwords, so I'm not that worried if he found that as well. I'll have to pre think of a lie, maybe even scratch the outside a bit & saying a friend handed it down to me… The real concern is connecting to the internet in a way he can't see, that isn't connected in any way to him or the house or our accounts. Using a dongle or a SIM card sounds ""easier"" for me to try & achieve & I'll look into that, even though I don't know what they are, they sound like ""easy"" words to google or ask a computer store. It's difficult when you don't know anything, if you're asking for something that already exists & normal people know about & takes 2 seconds for them to explain or if you're asking for something that doesn't exist or is stupid. I apologise for the ignorance. If I had the time to join a different forum for every problem in this process, I could reach out to different fields like tech. But I only have SaSu so have been leaning on it really really heavily for advice as I need help & don't have anywhere else to go. I have received much generosity here - people sharing their skills & time & understanding that I'm in a tight spot knowledge wise & time wise & have just helped with things I can't do by myself. I appreciate any responses. Thank you very much.
Ha! I accidentally sent both posts as one - 1 I thought I sent last night, then thought I sent now without rereading & then the 2nd starting from Sorry onwards. It's pretty clear that even basic things are beyond me. I'm fucking useless at all of this - the one thing I want to get right. As in CTB. Heartbreaking & soul destroying in a time when what led me here was already horrific. Thanks for your time guys. I'm so sorry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It's all worse which is just unbelievable to me. He's definitely still in my stuff - a few things popped up the other day & I got a young person (!!) to look at it for me & it took them 2 seconds to see how he was accessing multiple email addresses of mine. I have what I hope is a secret one, in that I've never told him about & haven't autosaved passwords etc. But I don't know how much tracking he's doing. I uninstalled a bunch of apps. Changed more passwords. But when I could see he was in my emails again, I couldn't see how, even after googling. But the kid took 2 seconds. I went home & confronted him about it & that was fucking stupid. I knew it was stupid when I did it. Everything is worse & I have less time alone, no privacy. My decision to CTB is independent of him & is not impulsive. I have been making this decision gradually & then finally. It's not just escape him & you'll be fine. It's health issues & complicated life circumstances & a bunch of things that can't improve, even if I tried. He's just making everything worse. I tried looking into the laptop thing but didn't get far. Have temporarily abandoned, maybe permanently. I don't know. I didn't learn enough to feel confident. I don't live near Apple geniuses to fix my phone but was hoping to make a special trip but then realised he would know if everything he was doing was somehow removed. And that that would be stupid. I'm trying (please god, that I don't believe in, please) get enough alone time to test my SN. Both blood & aquarium. And please god please let it be legit. I don't have a backup source & didn't want to open & test until CTB day but I can't take the anxiety of it anymore. So attempting to test ASAP but am worried I'll fuck it up - I haven't read the full instructions on how to do yet & I'm horrifically bad at following instructions & math & science &'it appears every fucking thing. I am so useless at all of this. Plus struggling to find blood pics that aren't links - too scared to click anything. Someone kindly sent me a pic but was hoping for more. I came on SaSu now to read the instructions & crack on while I had the house to myself for once, but have ended up procrastinating out of fear & dread so have written you a rambling batshit crazy message instead of Just. Doing. The. Thing. Crazy with anxiety I'll do it wrong or not be able to do it all. Anxiety I'll get busted. Anxiety I'll spill it or contaminate it & won't have enough. And the dread in the bottom of both my stomach & my soul that I've been scammed & just don't know what to do with that as an outcome. I hope you're ok - being on SaSu generally isn't a great sign…Thanks for asking how I am, but they say don't ask questions you don't want answers to & I've just written all this drivel. Sorry.

However for a drop like that it's about an hour drive which isn't too bad. the trains that pass in my home time go by frequently so i've been considering that.

now my biggest dilemma here is what day to choose probably within the next week or so, so could someone help me pick a day?

i'm not sad, scared, or angry. im actually quite blissful my life has come to an end. ultimately im a nihilist at heart. i tried killing myself and failed when i was younger. i'm now 19, 3 cars, a 3 bedroom house, government job, and in college, and also a barista haha. [no i'm not exhausted i have tons of energy]

so why am i doing this? i initially fell in love with a girl when i was 13 and it caused so many years of emotional turmoil and suffering. sounds funny, but i really love deeply. i started dating someone else after years and unfortunately my now ex girlfriend was unfaithful to me. i feel like life is beautiful but im not ready for the breakup to process and i feel 100% content in my life, i don't want to suffer this time.

i have everything i could want, and i feel empty, i feel like i've completed life.

i have affected many lives and i believe i have always been kind to others and left a good impression, because i know i genuinely care for others, but it was never reciprocated. i have no real close friends.

i want anyone who did me wrong to feel the pain i do, because i love and feel so deeply, and i want everyone to regret being rude to me, the humans i know are monsters.

TLDR: ex girlfriend was unfaithful and i don't feel like suffering, i'm 100% content with my life, and i want all eyes on everyone who's done me wrong.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

It boggles my mind that most humans never consider suicide and are ok working so hard just to exist so that something really horrible happens to them

I didn't have any problems for 13.8 billion years all the time before I was born. The big problems began for me when they birthed me into this evil world as a small animal that can suffer unending constant unbearable pain.

In non-existence forever I can escape this evil world forever.

Only in non-existence can I be free from all the threats and all the problems and hassles forever

Life is an imposition, torture slavery prison. But they have so many fearing non-existence which is the only freedom from all the horrors

Non-existence forever is the ultimate bliss

Parents who wish to CTB,2459575,Kit1,"Apr 12, 2024 at 9:40 AM","Dear RejectedKarma,

Welcome to the parents guilt life - I have two children (teenagers) and they are the sole reason for me trying my absolute best to keep myself alive. The reality (and ample evidence points to this as well) is that children will suffer greatly if either of the parent die by suicide. There is also a higher chance of a child/children ending their lives if a parent had ended their life. My aunty ended her life in the 1970s leaving behind two children aged under 5. In the 90s, the younger daughter ended her life. The elder daughter is struggling - bit there is trauma there and then there is the intergenerational trauma.

If anyone, regardless of whether they are a parent or not, ends their life - I will only have empathy and sympathy for that person. Because despite knowing all the stats and seeing what suicide can do for the generations to follow, it is painful to remain when we feel like we have reached the end of the road.

Good Luck with whatever decision you make - and I hope that you have looked at other alternatives and reached out for support before you make any firm decisions. Take care.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

My father committed suicide when I was 4 years old by using CO in his car. At 23 years old, I have only one vague memory of him from back then.
I don't remember what his voice sounded like, his mannerisms or what his personality was like, outside of what I've been told by family members.

Despite the fact that I don't remember him though, his death has definitely affected the course of my life greatly. I processed his death in many different ways, with varying degrees of maturity given my age, and I can safely say it fucked me up quite a bit. In fact, I think it's pushed me Towards suicide as well. Maybe it's not the deciding factors, but a huge contributing one to my poor mental health.

losing a parent In ANY way is traumatic for a child, and losing them to suicide is even more so. It brings a whole other sequence of questions regarding their motives and their mental state. Your son will most like think:

Why did they do it? Was I not important enough for them to stay? Why didn't they want to raise me? Did they not want kids, and that's why they ctb? Did they know how bad their ctb would fuck me up, and not care?

A million different questions. They'll feel anger and sadness and grief at extremely young ages. It's confusing and, at times, crippling. Even if you say your son is young enough to move on and not remember you, your suicide will inevitably be a traumatic part of their life, for the rest of their life. that is not in question, because it will be. It's up to you to decide if that matters to you at this point in your life, and whether you think your son will have the support system required to work through the issues your death will inevitably cause them.

You saying ""I think they'll be fine, they'll forget about me"" etc etc is a huge cope. Like I said, I don't want sway your decision to ctb. I would just say if you DO decide to ctb, your son deserves you looking at things from THEIR perspective too. Ctb if you want, but when you make that decision, make it with the understanding that you will alter the course of your child's life forever, and most likely not in a positive way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

@Kit1 made a very good point, and specially because the kid is little, he will be affected more. He probably won't believe in an afterlife forever, either.

I'd like to say it's your decision, but this cases are very delicate, because the people involved is more vulnerable than anyone else, and one made the decision to make them dependent. For the better or worse, our choices shape the responsibilities we take.

I understand one doesn't control suicidal ideation, otherwise, almost no one would die that way. It's usually a response to exhausting coping ways. However, if it was possible to improve, I'm sure your son will love it. :)

I disagree. OP's condition may not necessarily cause neglect or abuse to the child, and that's also more in control than suicidal ideation. Plus, being orphan may feel like an extreme form of neglect. Sure, it helps leaving someone to care about the child, but it's still not ideal. As I said, rights have obligations, but it's not always in our control what other's do and how they feel.

Nothing I've said is trying to guilt-trip, it's just how things are. There can't be an ideal solution for everyone, and I think the right of the child should be prioritized. It wasn't his choice to be through all this, after all.",2459619,,,,,,,,,,,,

I lost my father when I was a child, and although at first I didn't think I was severely impacted, a few years ago I had a mental breakdown and was hospitalized for an extended period. I never truly recovered, and I am still dealing with that grief now. My point being, even if you don't think your child will be impacted too much, I can guarantee they will, at least subconsciously.

Even so, as long as your child has another strong support system to care for them (parent, grandparent, etc.), I think you're completely within your right to CTB. Especially if your suicidal ideation is impairing your ability to parent. Having a parent who is there but not really there isn't going to be any more beneficial than not having a parent at all, at least in my opinion.

If you do end up CTBing, it might be nice to leave your child a note explaining why you did it for them to have when they get older. I'd also recommend leaving behind a voice memo so they can always have your voice. I know that really helped me when my dad died.

I didn't have MH issues or suicidal ideation when I had my kids, if I had I wouldn't have had them. So, I don't blame myself for feeling the way I do now. However I do recognise that my detachment from them is ultimately about protecting me, rather than them; and I'm struggling to come to terms with that. Suicide is selfish, but I'm testing my thought process on how selfish I'm prepared to be.

As with any suicide decision, it's one that can only be taken by the suicidal person. Others experiences and advice may help you decide one way or another, but I think you have to be so much more open with yourself when young children are involved.

I've had this conversation with my community mental health team (I've got a fantastic NHS team) and I've kind of given them the green light to section me if I get to the point where they think I'm about to take my life - as a way of giving me time to reflect.

Just some reflections following all the answers:

Suicide continues to carry stigma in our society but it seems this somehow gets bigger when the person who experiences suicidal ideation or dies by suicide is a parent.

Mental health is supposed to be a myth that we don't talk about to children at any level like they wouldn't understand. Anything expressed in age appropriate manner will be understood.
I am saying this because talking about it takes the burden of people feeling isolated and alone
No, mental health is there just like physical health. Just like any organ in our bodies, our brain can also have functionality issues, however you wish to conceptualise mental health.
So why is it so difficult to accept this?

If a parent has cancer and has lost hair and weight and their body is bruised from the whatever treatment they are doing, would you keep that parent away from their children because it's better for the child not to see them like that?
Then why do it with one who wishes to die?
What's so difficult to explain suicide to children?
They are going to hear about it anyway and the way we present this concept to them is going to influence the way they perceive: as a stigma or maybe some glorified if they end up watching that Netflix series.
Do you think talking about suicide is going to increase suicide rates? This is like talking about homosexuality, genders and what not? Do we think talking to children about these things increases their prevalence?

It seems that the pro choice movement exists but not for parents.

If you disconnect completely you might just find that you can interact with them if you don't have to anymore.

I think it would be good to at least allow the kids to see you occasionally if they want to. And when they are bigger you can teach them any hobby you might have... you don't have to play childrens games anymore... i am not a very good player either...",,,,,,,,,,,,,

i wish i had a different life,2586756,untilwebecomestars,"Jul 5, 2024 at 11:05 PM","I don't feel like typing much... but to sum it up, I just wish I was brought up differently. I feel like I've wasted so much of my life even though I guess I'm on the younger side of the people on this website. I feel like I haven't done enough but I feel like it's too late.

The biggest reason is my dad. I won't go into much detail but he's the definition of wasted potential. If he got a job, we would have more money, which would have completely altered the course of my life. That's why when I have a child (if I even make it that far... ) I want to give them the life that I never got to have. I'm determined to work hard for my goals. I can't make the same mistakes my family made.

I guess that explains why I'm pretty good with kids lmao. My friends' little sisters and brothers always love me because I guess I know how to keep them happy lol. With them, I try my best to put on my best smile and play with them so that I can help them make better memories. Much better than I had growing up.

depression on top of all that is also just... annoying. lmao

When my classmate committed suicide,2587477,vesisika,"Jul 6, 2024 at 3:59 PM","Two months ago, we had a traditional festival day at school, the most anticipated day of the year. Popcorn, candy, free condoms with our school's logo and no lessons. Music shows and comedians. Everything what the average youth would want from a school day if they got to decide. I had pretty decent time with my friends. The day ended and I went to Ikea with my friend to buy stuff for my future flat. I got home from shopping and started playing a game named V rising. It's about vampires and combat. I really loved the game. I was just getting my basement upgraded and I felt like I had found something I'm interested in. When I was gaming I looked at my phone hoping someone would have needed me. I had like 50 notifications. I opened my messages and then I read it. My classmate was gone. My heart was pounding, I started sweating, ripping hair out of my head, I sat down for a second just to get up and repeat that for 100 times because I didn't know what else to do. I called my friends, they agreed with me that it wasn't real. The principal sent a message for the whole school, to 700 students that one of us has passed away. She is gone. Forever. The weekend went by. All I could do was to iron my black button up skirt for Monday. No one told us to dress formal or black, but still most of the 700 students did. Something had really happened. The first school morning came, lessons were cancelled and my class was sitting in the hallway, it was silent as the grave, quite literally. We were in the 5th floor, and the elevator opened, there were like multiple social workers and psychologist, and they seemed terrified. Even they didn't know what to think. What to say. One of them was crying, our group's ""main teacher"". She was really broken. One of her ""kids"" like she called us had killed herself. She cried, we all cried. People that didn't know her cried in the hallways. We were all just, empty. She had a memorial table in the second floor. Well, first it was one table, but there were so many flowers from her friends and other people, even randoms from other schools, that we needed 3 tables to be able to put all the flowers there. There was also a book we could write stuff about her. A goodbye, words about what she meant for each and every one of us, apologies about stuff that should have been done. It was a thick book, but almost every page got filled. And the flowers, our biology teacher was changing the water and cutting the bad ends out of them like after every lesson, because that was everything she could do.

The memorial was there for a week and when I got my shit together I took the pen and started writing. And thinking. I though about our first school day, I was sitting in the right corner of the classroom, anxious as fuck and she sat down behind me. She had partly dyed her hair red, and she had cool clothes and a rainbow bag what all screamed gay. I gathered all my courage and turned around in my seat and I said something to her because she was so cool. I don't remember what but I said something, not knowing that 1,5 years later I would be sitting in her chair crying my eyes out when our teacher tells us she has killed herself. But back in the day, she made me feel safe. We had a same history course together, and again I gathered all my courage to ask her could I sit next to her. And she said ofc, ofc she said that, she was so nice. I learned that she hated history, and loved art. She was pretty damn good at it. We watched Joker together, because she wasn't interested about the course. She also loved pulp fiction. And I learned she loved David Bowie's music. I didn't know then that one year later I would be listening Life on mars on her funeral. After the course she gave me a high five bc she passed the course with like a C. I was proud of her. I got drunk the very first time of my life with her. She offered me a cigarette but I didn't took it. She laughed at me and called me pussy. I didn't know that three months later I would have wanted to smoke with her, more than anything.

She was a smart, most badass, gayest and art hipster person I have ever known. But the thing is, I didn't really even know her. I saw her mother the first time in her funeral. I hugged her, and I wished there was something I could have said. Something I could have done. Something else than buying a red rose and ironing the shirt. There wasn't. When I think about art, I think of her. When it's raining I wonder could there be a rainbow so I could look at it and think of her. When I see hair dye, I think of all the different kinds of hair she had. I was also supposed to dye her hair with my friend but we didn't have enough time. When we talk about mental health, I don't think about mine, I think of hers. When I drink alcohol, I think about her. When I think about history. When I think about school. When I think of video games I cannot longer play. When I think. But when she committed suicide, I am sure she wasn't thinking about me, we were just casual classmates after all, nothing special. She didn't know how much her death would affect us. me. And then I started thinking about the saying that there is always people that love you, even though you don't know that. And I started to believe in it.

freeze your arms in a bowl of ice water for about an hour to go completely numb. it will hurt but will get better over time.
before you do this, draw out your veins with a sharpie or something, because once you freeze your arms it will be swollen and red and you wont be able to see them anymore.
use a sharp razor or a very sharpened knife (i sharpened my knife but even then i suspect it wasnt sharp enough. get razor if possible)
cut lengthwise along the veins (not horizontally) to prevent clotting
get in warm bath to make blood flow to bleed faster

that's all i know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Too much pain,2587357,hopeless08,"Jul 6, 2024 at 2:21 PM","Now that I have my method, a million things, emotions are going through my mind. I can't take my pain anymore, it's unbearable like i said in previous post im scared of the actual act of dying so first thing is to be able to overcome that but most importantly is the suffering I'll put my loved ones through.
I made a suicide pact with my sister who is in chronic physical pain and as a result of that, emotional pain as well.
My issue now is that although we agreed to go together, sometimes by the things she says I feel that she not ready…
She's thinking of this more as if we need it in the future we'll have it, as if saying it's there just in case but I can't bear this emotional pain I'm feeling and I don't know how to go about this.
Leaving her is not an option. Of course I'm thinking about my mom who's 80 and had sacrificed everything for us, she's been the most amazing mother anyone could ask for, she's 80 years old, omg this is so hard to talk about I'm bawling thinking about the pain she will feel, absolute torture, I don't think she'll survive it, I'm sure upon hearing the news she would have a heart attack. I don't want her to go through that after everything she's done for us, this would be like an ultimate slap in the face.
I don't know why but it's my sister that I would never be able to leave behind, we have a very special bond, we have been through everything together, the good and the bad, some traumatic experiences
As well. When I imagine the pain she would feel upon hearing the news that I'm gone, is unbearable, just thinking about one second of the pain she would feel is too much for words. I would not be able to withstand that pain and vice versa.
I have two younger siblings but I think it would be a bit easier on them, meaning that eventually they would possibly be able to live their lives, with constant pain of course but would survive it.
If my sister was ready, which I don't think she is, but if she was ready, another issue is my mother having to loose not one but both of her kids, the pain would be unimaginable, how can we do that to her?
Anyway back to my sister, I have no idea how to go about this, I can bear my pain any longer but I can't leave her either. It's an extremely complicated situation.
I'm so angry at the universe, I don't get why we have to be put through agony and it's especially the good people that suffer most it's not fair, it's just cruel.
I used to believe in god but not anymore and if he does exist I'm sorry to say this but he must be a sadist.
I'm sorry for the rant and being all over the place, it's just that my pain isn't allowing me to think clearly and there's too much emotion in me right now that I'm just rambling.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I've read Fent OD accounts (accidental ODs who were brought back with Narcan) and it really is the ever mythical and coveted 'peacefully knocked out cold and then taken to the other side' OD. So long as you're not discovered by some busybody and given Narcan... it seems like a solid way to CTB. Especially if you have no tolerance.

Recent experience with lamotrigine (Lamictal) + propranolol overdose,2587057,miminkpo,"Jul 6, 2024 at 8:42 AM","I took about four boxes total of 56 lamictal pills. I weigh about 85kg and I am 21 years old. I was found within two hours of ingestion and I was barely saved. I woke up from a coma after 10 days. I had seizures but don't remember having any pain, I just remember taking the pills, lying in bed and passing out. I combined it with about 200mg of propranolol but I'm pretty sure this method would have worked without it.

Right now I don't have a realible method to kill myself. I still have a box of around 30 pills of 50mg lamotrigine, plus quetiapine and clonazepam (around 56 pills of each). Also alcohol and tramadol. It is very unlikely these pills by themselves will kill me, but I'm wondering if I take everything at once... would that be enough? I don't have anything else available right now and I'm a bit desperate.

Fun fact, the hospital is going to publish a case study of my method since what I tried wasn't done before, as in the mix and the quantity of pills. They confirmed that what I did would have killed me 100% if I wasn't found in time... so, that's that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I don't know how recent this was, but I'd recommend taking a break to make sure your body is truly ""back to normal"".

Some people do luck out in terms of not having lasting effects, but there's also lots of effects that don't show symptoms immediately, so it's best to make sure everything is functioning normally before considering another risky attempt (where the side effects are unpredictable).

For anyone else reading this, the main risks of these methods are surviving with side-effects/organ damage. I took an overdose of Wellbutrin many years ago, it did cause me to go unconscious, have a seizure and need intensive hospital treatment. But the dosage per person, the time you need without being found, and other factors are so variable with these medication overdoses, and the risk of organ damage that you have to live with if you survive is high.

So I'd never say a medication OD like this is a good idea, even in desperate situations, considering the risks.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly enough I did not feel any pain, just the feeling of my face sliding down felt very uncomfortable and disgusting. Woke up pretty traumatized.

In my second dream I went crazy and felt insanely strong urge to cut off my hand by the wrist, but I was too hesitant to do it so I started by cutting off my ring and pinky finger and I also really wanted to eat them, which I know I did but I don't remember it - it was like a cut in a dream. Then I wanted more and went for the wrist - cutting off my hand completely and I started laughing. Again I felt little to no pain. What makes this dream stand out is the fact that the dream wasn't actually traumatizing, it did not feel like a nightmare, It felt good even, throughout the whole dream and I woke up relaxed and happy - as if I woke up from a nice dream which obviously didn't last long, It just took my brain a while to properly wake up and function to realize how disturbing it was.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Official Danish doctors list of drugs and procedures for a good results,949679,ReadySetGooooo,"Oct 29, 2020 at 4:49 PM","Nobody likes waking up as a vegetable as a result of a failed suicide by drugs, so Danish pro active euthanasia doctors posted a list of drugs and procedures for good results. This is a Google translated document, so be extra careful when picking your drug(s) of choice. Also if you are not suffering from a chronic and painful disease, I would highly recommend that you talk to a professional first. I've seen posts on this board talking about acids they wish to inject, and I highly recommend that you do NOT dabble with that stuff. It will be beyond painful and could last for hours. So as a fail-safe in order to keep your as painless as possible, a list has been published. I hope you read it carefully and good luck!

Multiple spiritual awakenings,2584376,spentspirit,"Jul 3, 2024 at 8:46 PM","TL:DR, don't do drugs, and don't ever allow your friends, family, or loved ones to do drugs.

I used to be hyper-intelligent. My IQ tested at 144 when I was 12, but I had ADHD and couldn't really focus on the test and my psych thought it was actually much higher. I was put on Strattera and Vyvanse, which made me suicidal and made my eating disordered; I also couldn't sleep well. Later I stopped and developed coping mechanisms for the ADHD, which I now know is really complex trauma.

My family's background is...complex. I've never met anyone more multiracial or multiethnic than myself. My mother is French/Italian/Spanish and Jewish/Berber Moroccan/Algerian; my father is Guyanese with a mix of Amazonian/Portuguese and Chinese/Angolan/Welsh. At the same time, we have a lot of generational trauma that's persisted and created a lot of mental illness. My father and his father were the first to the scene of the Jonestown massacre, and my grandfather worked with the KGB and the CIA to secure deals and curry political favor for the country's airline. My mother's mother was the victim of a pogrom that took out her entire settlement in Morocco on Yom Kippur when she was 12. Plus more stuff I can't really discuss on this forum.

I've been fortunate enough to travel all across the world, hike many places across the US and Canada, and receive a fantastic education.

Unfortunately, though, I never saw the point of living. Everything was easy and I was unmotivated because people always seemed to want to either use me or misunderstood me. I never formed a solid ego that I liked; I was an outcast all of my life. My mom abandoned me with my dad when I was 2 for her boss. I would spend every weekend with my mother and weeks with my father, until later on when my mother sued for custody at which point I started to see my father less and less. Mom dated around a lot and started to take me between households of different people for a few years at a time.

My childhood was extremely unstable; once we eventually arrived with my stepfamily, I enjoyed a period of stability for about 7 years, but all the while things were still rocky. I never was able to form healthy social attachments with anyone, not my parents, not my family, and not my friends. The people I most enjoyed being around were my parents' friends, who I could talk about politics with.

In temple when I was 10, my best and only friend showed me the ugliest parts of the internet. I'm talking /b/, where Nazism, gore, rape, murder, incest, child pornography and the like ran rampant. He showed me lots of porn that he liked, especially drawn porn like hentai and yaoi as well as varieties with kids in it called shota. Eventually the emotional abuse turned into sexual abuse and he forced himself onto me. The grooming lasted over a year. Later therapy was... Unhelpful because I could not tell them what had happened.

Later in life I started doing drugs and drinking heavily, especially in college. I did not apply myself; everything was too easy, and I had no real interests to speak of beyond imagining what a better future would be like.

I tried really hard to be a part of that future to be honest. I really wanted to change the world in a meaningful way. When I failed at that through work, I went the religiosity route. I had multiple spiritual awakenings...and to be honest, what I saw terrified me. I'm not sure how real it is, but what I do know is that I feel guilty for wasting this precious gift of life that I have been given.

Things really derailed during the pandemic when I smoked weed every night, going to raves, and was in a toxic relationship. After that I couldn't stop making bad life decisions that really destroyed me and my brain. The nails in the coffin were hormones, longevity supplements, and magic mushrooms.

I don't want to keep taking up space for those folks who want to live and start families that will outlast this current bout of crazy.

I've chosen the night night method. I'm not sure when I'll go out, but I hope that I can make amends with certain folks before I do. Life is so much work, and I'm so tired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Multiple spiritual awakenings,2587111,spentspirit,"Jul 6, 2024 at 10:23 AM","Yeah, so I had a few psychotic episodes... I got really deep into kaballah and my senses started to expand to an unreasonable degree.

First it was that I could hear well beyond the confines of my apartment, and I started to imagine that my own mental state was affecting my neighborhood. Then I started to see fine particulates in the air some 100 to 200 feet away, then I could focus on 10-20 people talking at once...then I thought I heard G-d in the collective consciousness. And then I really lost it and saw divine light.

To be clear, all of these times I was on cannabis, and I had been microdosing mushrooms for months and was also taking longevity supplements and hormones. My biochemistry was well beyond the average human.

I can't tell you whether or not what I experienced was real or psychosis, but what I can say is that by the end of it I had lit up my nervous system so much that all of my nerve endings, my heart, and my brain were on fire and just in constant pain from all of the degradation. I melted away a serious amount of my nervous system.

The body is plastic and all and these things can heal with time, but I will never be what I once was. I had a lot of body privilege and I threw a lot of that away to go on a spiritual journey that I was not prepared for. I just was so confused about life -- my story is complex and unusual, I've always been a loner, I never learned how to fit in or develop healthy habits or interests that balanced creativity and intelligence.

Now, I really want to ctb, but first I've been systematically cutting myself off from life so that when I do leave there's less damage to the rest of reality (less than what I've already done).",,,,,,,,,,,,,

How much SN do I take for my weight?,2510632,eunoia,"May 9, 2024 at 11:21 PM","Hi.
I would just like somebody to confirm that I'm taking the correct grams of SN for my weight/height. I'm currently 92 lbs and I'm like 4'10 or so? I have the weight/water dose chart and the closest weight to mine is 88 lbs. The dosage for that is 32ml of water and 16g of SN. Would that be the right amount for me? I read that it's really important to make sure you're taking the right amount.
please help ;((

and if anyone has any extra tips for the SN method please let me know

thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Autumn I had the most amazing time in Venice then weeks later I gave my strongest ever interview performance when I came back to the UK. I got the job. The salary was great it was an increase from my last job.

I fell in love with an older man in his 50s because he just made me feel so special and it was great finally having a man see me while guys my own age ignored me and all my life I have been that girl now woman who never gets picked and always ignored and overlooked. Winter it was snowing in my city and across the UK. During my lunch break I took a stroll in the snow and it was so magical because my life was finally coming together and I was looking forward to the future. For the first time I wanted to live.

Christmas seasn I brought so many gifts for my family household with my work salary. The living room was full of presents I brought my family.

Then in 2023 it all came crashing down rapidly. I went from having the best year of my life to the worst year ever. January was stuck overseas being forced to see my relatives who dont even care about me and that month overseas was pure hell. The man Ioved who I wanted a future with kept messing with my head with his lying and mind games. He messed me up so badly. February I got fired. April my eating disorder gets discovered. The only good thing I had was getting into a masters programme and The last minute I was forced to defer my place which now I am going to lose this year.

I really wanted to live but it's obstacle after obstacle. I have been fighting to make things work out because I am not quitter now I can't fight anymore. At 27 I have nothing good in my life no husband, no successful career, no friends and I am just a loser",,,,,,,,,,,,,

How did you get over your fear of death?,2586861,BojackHorseman,"Jul 6, 2024 at 2:37 AM","I actually think something kinda similar. I am very much an athiest. I believe in what can be seen and tested. But I do think it might be important to imagine the afterlife is a peaceful happy place.

So think about going to sleep and dreaming. Surely I am not the only one who ever had a dream that felt like only a few seconds, just to wake up and realize its been hours. Or I've had the the complete opposite. So our brain seems to process time differently in a dream like state. The episode of Bojack Horseman when he is drowning in the pool, and his unconscious mind is imagining all the people in his life who died. He sees them all putting on a show. After each one is finished performing, they walk through a door into black nothingness. Bojack is the last to perform, and he tells his friend Herb who was acting as the announcer ""See you on the other side."" before he is about to walk through the door. Herb chuckles and says ""No. There is no other side. This is it. This is just your brain doing what it feels like it needs to do.""

That episode made me think. Those moments as your brain dies, what will it be doing? Is it gonna feel like a really long dream, a dream that in reality is only seconds or minutes? If so, what will it be doing? Will our brain be doing the same thing, imagining whatever it thinks its supposed to be thinking? If you have fear or a guilty conscious like Bojack, if you feel like your gonna go to some sort of hell when you die, is that what your brain will imagine as it dies? Can we instead picture peace and happiness as the afterlife so if we do spend time in some sort of dream like unconscious state it will be pleasant one. Obviously I dont think it will be permanent, I dont believe in a real afterlife, but I'm sure it will feel just as real while it happens.

Not sure if any of that made sense. Maybe I'm just crazy, but it makes sense in my head lol Basically I think we are in control of our own temporary, fake ""afterlife"" depending on our thoughts and emotions.",2586420,,,,,,,,,,,,

How did you get over your fear of death?,2586872,Ash,"Jul 6, 2024 at 2:55 AM","I've never been scared of death, at least not since I was a very small child. Growing up on a farm helps. Not just the livestock and seeing young born and a few stillborn, plus knowing where food on the plate comes from and helping to prepare chickens for Sunday dinner from the chicken field to the plate - usually the belligerent cockerels, but also going out on my own little adventures and finding dead animals and even more exciting, skeletons or skeletal remains and realising that it's all just one big cycle. Death is meant to feed the earth so that the next generation can feed on the grass and flowers and fruits - or the animals who feed on them. Without it, everything would wither away and would have done so billions of years ago.

It's not death that scary. Dying - now that can be terrible. And we can plan all we like but very few get to die with dignity or in peace. It's rarely instant or painless. And it's not in our control. Even if we kill ourselves. That's what's scary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

To get over fear of Death

1. Death is going to happen anyway to everyone and everything so why fear the impending inevitability?

2. After Death is non-existence forever : no chance of pain , problems, suffering ever . I don't see how anyone could fear that non-existence forever = zero pain , no extreme pain ever

Benzo OD Symptoms,2586967,rj3542,"Jul 6, 2024 at 6:07 AM","I'm planning on using benzos to aid in going unconscious with SN and make the experience easier. I have 35mg Valium, 70 mg Ativan, 2 mg xanax.

Benzo.dosage recommended for SN are 20x30mg oxazepam but I can't get oxazempam, so I converted the oxaz dose to what I have which is:

2 mg xanax (2 tabs) = 2 oxaz tabs
35mg Valium (7 tabs) = 2 oxaz tabs
32 mg Ativan (16 tabs) = 16.oxaz tabs

I'm planning on crushing this, making a thin paste, and letting it absorb in my mouth 30 minutes before taking the SN so it hopefully hits me the same time.

I've never taken anywhere near this high a dose of benzos though, so I'm not sure what to expect.

Even though it wasn't the reason for my visit, I profited off this occasion to ask for antiemetics, explaining my request with the fact that my migraines I told him about last time (treated with Propranolol) frequently cause me nausea and occasionally vomiting (which is true !).
He said he'd prescribe me antiemetics right away but then he checked something on his computer, looked concerned, and suddenly backtracked saying it was contraindicated to take this medication with Propranolol. I couldn't find anything online mentionning any interactions so I guess he just remembered these two bad boys are frequently used for CTB.

And it's so frustrating because, sure, if I'm being honest I actually asked for them for CTB reasons,
BUT I'm not sure if I'm ready yet, so I would have just found it reassuring to own them ""just in case"",
And if I'm not ready it would have been great to take them anyway to manage the nauseas in the meantime.
So now I'm stuck with my nauseas AND I'm feeling even more anxious than before, even more trapped in this world, and my hope to have a way to leave if it ever gets too much just vanished, because everything else I need for my plan is ready and the only thing I miss is this simple med I can't get.

Idk

I was rejected because I'm on Propranolol, which is, from what I've gathered online, used pretty frequently for CTB purposes.
But one has to combine it with an anti-emetic for it to work or else they'd vomit the whole thing.

Because I really don't see why she'd refuse to give me anti-emetics otherwise, since she doesn't know I own a large quantity of Ami.

Let's talk about harassment towards a SaSu member.,2176906,RainAndSadness,"Sep 30, 2023 at 12:52 PM","Hello everyone.

As some of you know, there are a bunch of people out there on Twitter, campaigning to get this forum shut down - without much success, of course. We're still here and we just recently had our five years anniversary, which is amazing and I'm confident we will stay around for a long time. I'm not concerned about this forum at the moment. The fixers tried to make access to this forum for UK members more difficult with the Online Safety Bill which was supposed to criminalise ""legal but harmful"" content and they hoped the ""Stop Online Suicide Assistance Forum Act"" would move forward, neither of that happened. And the people who celebrated the recent passing of the Online Safety Bill as a game changer despite its harmful effect on free speech and internet safety seem to underestimate the role of VPNs in this entire conversation, as there is a documented direct link between censorship and a surge in VPN usage. Their problem is, they have exhausted all options at this point and there aren't any legal angles left to take down this forum. Sure, they can hope for more articles and more Youtube videos about us, which will only make the forum more popular anyway, as I've outlined here. Their strategy so far clearly hasn't worked.

That's why they're resorting to personal harassement now, they know intimidating people who run this forum into submission is the only realistic way to get rid of this forum. And they know they can achieve that for example if they dox me. That was the goal of the NYT coverage back in 2021, in which the founders of this forum were the main subject of the article and intimidation was a huge factor of that hit piece. They had partial success and achieved their goal because the founders stepped down shorty after but the forum is still here because I'm still here. And that's a problem for the people who oppose this forum. So the fixers are trying to repeat that incident from 2021, this time targeting me in hopes I would step down because I'm the one running this community now. There is just one problem. They don't know who I am but for some reason, they think they do. And that's the point of this thread.

Now, what does that mean. Here are some examples. These following attachements are screenshots of Tweets from someone who is very obsessed with my identity, making lowkey threats into my direction. She has been doing that for a long time. Her Twitter account has since been deleted but the threats made in these Tweets still remain relevant to this day and I'll explain why in a bit. She made very clear in these Tweets that she thinks I'm a 50 years old trans-woman from New Mexico whose initials are ""TAF"", who has children and according to Catherine, is using donations to fund gender-affirming surgeries. Obviously, all these claims are false but let's go through these Tweets one by one.

Here she claims I'm 50 years old and that I live in New Mexico. That's not where I live and I'm not nearly 50 years old. I'm still in my twenties and I never made a big secret out of my age, the people who have known me for a bit longer can confirm these details aren't true.



Here is an example of them mentioning initials of what's supposed to be my name, ""TAF"". It's not my name nor do these initials resemble my real name.



Here she mentions me again, talking about children I'm supposed to have. There is just one problem. I don't have children and nothing is going to change that. I'm an anti-natalist, not just in theory but also in practice. I would never give up my freedom for offspring and since I'm a a trans woman who can't give birth, children are not an option. It's not that complicated.



And here she threatens to publish my face all over Twitter. Except it's not my face, it's the face of an innocent third party who for some reason got dragged into all of this because the fixers are unable and unwilling to fact-check their own accusations towards me but I'll explain that in a bit.



And in this Tweet Catherine claims donations are used to fund my surgeries.



First of all, no, donations aren't used to fund surgeries and I'm not sure why you believe I had ""gender reassignment surgery"". I never said I did and I don't see why that's anyone's business. What I can say is that all my trans-related surgeries and procedures so far were covered by insurance, all of them. It's simple, I live in a country where this type of medical procedure is covered by basic health insurance. Crazy, right? Well, that happens when you live in a civilized country. I could of course prove all of that in a court of law, there are health care documents which prove my health insurance paid for every single dollar of these treatments. But that's never going to happen because we'll never see each other in such a scenario, where I would have to defend myself in a court, as this website clearly isn't illegal and I haven't committed any crimes. Again, there wouldn't have been a bill to make this forum illegal if this forum was illegal but I guess logic isn't the fixers' strength either. But the point is, I never had to pay for any surgery out of my own pocket, which means none of the donations were necessary to cover for any of them. The donations, all of them, go straight to the forum - for some reason these people forget that running a forum costs money too and as long as the donations cover the costs of the forum, there is nothing shady about that. You can also fact-check for yourself that the donations we have received so far simply aren't enough to cover very complicated and extensive trans-affirming surgeries, they're tens of thousands of dollars. The people who oppose this forum simply want to make me look like the bad guy, and trying to do that by spreading doubt among community members about the authencity of me as a person. As I said, all conventional options to take down this forum have been exhausted, without much success so everything that might make it more difficult to run this forum is the next step and that includes slander and lies to sabotage this community and in this particular incoming donations. They're the fuel the forum is running on.

Now, let's get to the most important question. Why am I responding to these accusations? Well, first of all it affects an innocent person, a real person - namely the person that is attacked in these screenshots and that's not me. That person exists. Yeah, these threats are meant to go into my direction but they're not actually hurting me, they're hurting an innocent person that has done nothing wrong. I know who they're referring to, by the way. The person they think to be me has been a member of our community for a long time and I'm not going to mention their name to protect their privacy because unlike the fixers, I don't dox people. I respect the privacy fo anyone who wishes to remain anonymous and that's the big difference between me and them. So that's why I had to create this response in consideration of the privacy of the person that's been targeted in these Tweets and that's why I'm not going to dive into any further details about that person. But that person is real and they're victim of this targeted harassment. And I've reached out to the victim of this harassment and I've talked to them about this entire situation and this post has been created with the approval of said person - just to make that clear.

Kelli just recently made the following announcement and I'm worried they'll go after this person again - and this time it will get even worse. So that's why I'm posting this thread now, to signalize that's not me. And if they continue to harass said person, it will be clear that they're doing that despite my best attempts to stop them and despite the very high chance that they're harming someone else, ignoring potential collateral damage. I can also assure that any violations of my right to privacy would be handled very differently, certainly not in a thread like this because there are other means to defend myself. All I can do right now, in this particular case, is speak out and make sure it's understood that this isn't me. And what's what I'm doing with this thread, I'm not going to be silent anymore when these people act like absolute assholes, I made that clear when Tantacrul posted his video, implying I'm the one who is harassing anyone.



And while we're talking about Kelli, this is a good moment to remind everyone that she has doxxed members of our community as well. The more you dig into this anti-choice cult, the more you realize that they're absolutely vicious and they don't care if their actions are the final push that makes someone commit suicide. Again, the targets of their harassment are struggling SaSu members, which they claim are so vulnerable they need to be ""protected"" from ""harmful online content"" with the Online Safety Bill. And it doesn't really make sense for people who claim to be pro-life to act like this. Members of our community are already suffering enough and they don't need this bullshit. Leave them alone.
And these are the same few people by the way who also control the narrative through intense interaction with the journalists who write all these anti-SaSu hit pieces, just saying. Maybe that gives you some insight as to why the reputation of our forum is horrible.

Now. Of course I can't prove that I'm not 50 years old and living in New Mexico without actually revealing my own identity but I don't think that's even necessary. None of their claims are substantiated even with a hint of evidence, so I don't think I need to explain myself. The sole purpose of this thread is to stand up for the victim of this abuse, make clear that's not me and also make clear that these people alone bear the consequences of their actions. That's it. The burden of proof lies on these predators to back up their absurd claims that I've been a completely different person all along, it's not my job to debunk any of that. But I made clear now that these people are targeting the wrong person and that's enough in my opinion. The only thing we share is the fact that we're both trans and maybe that's why they think we're the same person. Maybe they think the probability that there are two trans people on SaSu is so small that I have to be that person but here is a reality check - we have a shitload of trans people in this community so that alone isn't really evidence.

And look, technically I couldn't care less if they go after someone else - it adds a layer of protection for me, simply because it means people are looking in the wrong places to uncover my identity, right? Sure but I don't like that they're going after innocent people. That's another difference between the fixers and me. They love to lash out to suicidal people and make them feel more miserable, I don't. And that's the only reason why I'm responding to these accusations, because it's simply absolutely disgusting to harass and intimidate someone who has absolutely nothing to do with the operation of this forum. It's a shame they're dragging a third party into this but their actions have tremendous collateral damage. As I've said above, they doxxed people in the past and they've harassed members of our community to the point of suicide, this isn't the first time they act like predatory assholes. And look, I'm also not going to simply ignore the fact that someone of my communities has been attacked. This is a member of SaSu and a member of the trans community, both are communities I appreciate dearly so I'm definitely going to call out nasty bullshit when I see it.

I'm also responding to this predatory behavior because it affects my reputation too. They're claiming I'm a completely different person when I've never been deceptive about who I am. My story and my background has been consistent throughout the years. From 2018 to 2023 I've never changed my story once because I've been sincere and open about who I am. Everything I said about myself has been the truth, the people in my team know that and people who are my friends do so as well.

So let me address these accusations here for the last time.





No Angela, you obviously don't know who I am. Given what you've tweeted in the last few months, you have no idea - all you did is harm an innocent person. There is a good chance you'll never find out who I am and that's a good thing. As a law-abiding citizen I have a right to privacy, it's that simple. And I have erased any tracks to sensitive information long before I became a member of this forum. So yeah, good luck finding any crumbles that lead to my identity. I wouldn't run this forum and expose myself to potential harm if I had massive online foodprint, don't you think? If there was information out there about my specific location, family members, my full name or when I was born (as you think that's my information), I wouldn't be in this position right now. I mean, that's pretty obvious. And I can also assure you that leaking any confidental information about the person you're targeting in these Tweets isn't going to end the forum's existence. Even if it was my information, it wouldn't, just to make that clear.

I've said it in the past and I'm going to say it again. These people are predators and they are preying on suicidal people under the disguise and with the justification of being 'grieving parents'. That's literally all they do. These screenshots are clear evidence for their disgusting behavior and it gets worse when you look at their long and extensive history of abuse towards members of our forum, the person that's been targeted in these Tweets isn't the only member that's been on the receiving end of their harassmentt, quite a few members could tell stories if they still were alive. But I might pick that up in the future and dedicate an entire thread to all the harassment they've done throughout the years. I have the receipts. I can tell the stories. And I'm done looking the other way. These predators need to get exposed, period.

Oh, and if you think what you've seen in these Tweets was bad, here is a little secret. I have intentionally left out more evidence that proves that they have been stalking the victim in this case and posting pictures of her too but as I said, I'm only posting evidence in this thread that protects the privacy of said person and that's why you only see a selected amount of Tweets, which don't contain identifying information. But it's a lot worse than this, let me tell you that. This entire thread only provides a small insight into the depraved behavior of these predators.

So yeah. I've planned this thread for a while but the due to the high chance they might lash out at an some random trans woman again, I felt the need to address the situation as quickly as possible. I hope they'll finally move on. I hope they'll seek therapy because they really need it, let's be honest. They think harming other will compensate for their pain of their loss but that's not how you heal. I've been through grief myself and that's not how I processed my emotions. And sincere question, do you see good actors in these Tweets? I don't. This here isn't the right way to go about it and I hope someday they will realize they have completely lost the plot. What started as activism to raise awareness about a forum back in 2019 has ended in targeted harassment towards suicidal individuals with the goal to ruin their lives, simply because the forum they've tried to deplatform is still up after all these years. Maybe sometimes it's better to take the L on a certain subject (because we're not going anywhere) than to end up being exposed as a predator on this forum. Just some food for thought.

It's a really unpleasant subject but it's important to talk about this. Thanks for your attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

But ignoring them hasn't really played into our favor, right? It gave them the freedom to harass our members without being held accountable and it also gave them control over the narrative around this forum. I think it's important to deconstruct what they say, especially when they attack innocent members of our forum. And in this particular case they've been targeting one specific member because they think that's me - for whatever reason, I still don't get. And with this thread I actually gave them the chance to either double down or backtrack but given their response to my thread has been a single 'fuck off' - which is is to be expected from malicious actors who don't want to explain anything and rather focus on harassment instead, confirming what I said about them being predators - it seems they have decided to double down. They could have explained themselves, apologized, anything. But it seems they're so convinced that I'm a particular person that's been on their radar for a very long time that all ratio has been thrown out the window. There are no excuses anymore after this thread, I made very clear they're harming the wrong person and they will have to face the consequences for their actions if they continue to harass that person. I mean, it's very simple - why would I bring attention to these Tweets if they contained accurate information about who I am? It's silly. And again, there are member in our forum that can confirm that none of the information in these Tweets refer to me in any way. Everyone in my team knows that.

And to everyone else, thank you for the support and kind words. It's appreciated and I'm glad the forum provides a safe space to discuss your most personal thoughts and struggles and we try our best to keep this forum up and running - despite all attempts to make us disappear. I don't fear these people, they're actually very predictable and their reaction just confirmed again that they don't know anything about me despite everything I've ever said in almost 2000 posts.

They can only hope to inspire outrage in others by weaponizing the deaths of their children for their unholy selfish petty goals. It's pretty disgusting.

They KNOW what they're doing. They must know these actions will only push people to suicide, but they do it anyways. I don't think it's really about preventing suicide anymore, it's just about blaming others and lashing out, as if this forum is the only reason people ctb. It's about being a kind of ""white knight"" and having the moral high ground as they cause collateral damage. These kinds of people only make things worse, and what's worse, normies and society at large will treat them as heroes even if their harassment, DOXing, and other activities pushes more people to suicide then shutting this forum could possibly prevent.

I really hate this world at times. Instead of improving it, the ""solution"" to suicide is typically drugs and manipulation/gaslighting to keep people just alive.

-

WTF this is the kinds of people who ""care about you""?!!? Honestly, this really proves my point. They don't want you to ctb, until they don't like you then they're suddenly LTG.
One of my deepest fears is that I talk IRL /w others, like family, and they keep me from ctb until they really know what I really am, see how I'm fucking hopeless then turn around and say, ""You should kill yourself NOW!"".

I went outside for the first time in 10 months to see the solar eclipse,2452882,Arvinneedstodie,"Apr 8, 2024 at 5:04 PM","I'm currently writing this post from my favorite spot of my favorite park. This is the first time I've stepped outside during the day in over 10 months, the first time I've been back in this park in over a year. I suffer from bad agoraphobia, among other worsening issues that have put me in a state of deep depression and isolation. I've been building myself up the past couple weeks to step outside and witness this solar eclipse today. I was finally able to step outside and I'm still sitting in this park, trying to piece together the racing thoughts and emotions in my head.

I didn't have the solar eclipse glasses, and I couldn't find one from any of the stores on the way to the park. I came to the park anyway, thinking surely someone else there would share their glasses with me. By the time i got to the park the eclipse was happening, and there were many groups of people watching. Against my social anxiety, I asked three people for the glasses, two of them politely rejected me in a cold manner. An older lady who was by herself handed me her glasses before I even finished my words. That was my only quick glimpse of the eclipse today. I thanked her and walked to a quieter corner of the park. While everyone was looking up, I was looking down and around. I was more amazed at the seagulls and ducks swimming around the water, it's been a while since I've been around nature. The park and the views of the water and skyline are pretty amazing.

I'm happy to be here, but I feel like a lonely ghost back in my favorite childhood park, surrounded by strangers from a different time. I feel like the loneliest person in this whole entire city, but then my estranged mother called me, asking if I'm watching the eclipse. I realized that I'm still luckly enough to have my mother who remembers my existence. There must be people out there who don't have anyone, not even their mothers. I'm 28, a rotten hollowed out zombie, rising from the shallow grave, hanging on by the last remaining thread of stubborn internal hope. How long until I become that someone who's truly alone. How much longer can I survive in this world like this. How long before i exhaust that last thread of hope and can no longer rise from the grave. Screw that underwhelming solar eclipse. Screw those cold people who can't even share their 2 dollar paper glasses, even though their groups had many glasses. Thank you old lady for maintaining that last ounce of kindness. The sea air is refreashing, the ducks are adorable, the seagulls are seagulls, the nature is better than I remembered, and man these views, these views are amazing.

I think I'm ready to finally come out of the isolation and hold my head above the water so i can take a hard look at where i am. I need to decide if I want to exhaust and exploit these last bits of hope until none is left, or do I want to hold on to them and leave with them. I hate the idea of leaving without clinging on to at least some last bits of hope, like a book ending without any room left for questions or what ifs. I don't know if im making any sense, but I'm in a conundrum here. I never thought I would live this long, it's been a confusing and detached life. I also didn't think I could ever come out to the park again, and here I am...

For anyone reading this, thank you for reading. For anyone out there who can remotely relate to me, I'm sorry if you're also lonely and hopeless. If you were here with me, I would do anything for you. I mean it, I would have braved against my anxiety and asked as many people as I could to get a pair of those glasses for you. I would have done way more for you than I did for myself today.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm nervous about the abdominal pain and heart racing/anxiety. I included the benzos because it's hard for me to lose consciousness normally (never blacked out when I was a heavy drinker and couldn't lose consciousness with nitrogen gas method even with O2 down in 50s). I included the propranolol to help with the tachycardia.

Benzo dosage
I used this handy calculator to convert PHP recommended dose of 600mg oxazempam to what I have on hand
Benzodiazepine Conversion Calculator
Our benzodiazepine conversion calculator allows you to compute the equivalent doses of drugs when switching from one to another.
omnicalculator.com

Benzos recommended are 20x30mg oxazepam
1 30mg oxazempam = about
1 mg xanax
2mg Ativan
15mg valium

I have on hand:
2 mg xanax (2 tabs) = 2 oxaz tabs

Do you have any feedback or critiques? I know simpler can often be better, but I'm weighing that with my phisiology and difficulty with loss of consciousness a.d fear of pain.

Advice on SN timeline,2586830,b1cycle,"Jul 6, 2024 at 1:34 AM",I read that you really only need 8 hours of fasting. I think too much fasting will increase the acidity of your stomach which is the opposite of what you want. You just don't want anything in your stomach.,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Advice on SN timeline,2616036,PhDone,"Jul 31, 2024 at 9:47 PM","I like this protocol. Questions for you:

- do you expect any side effects of propranolol, eg. dizziness or drowsiness that might compound things from there with benzo's?
- how did you figure tramadol dose? I have morphine and wondering whether to use this as pain killer prior or as part of knock-out/lethal drug immediately post SN
- what are you thinking benzo peak time will be?
- what time gap are you thinking to know if vomiting will occur, like 5-10min post intake maybe? Have you thought about the benzo window accomodating this?

Love the research you're putting into this and thanks for posting it for others to learn from.

Hoping you go with peace.",2586827,,,,,,,,,,,,

But either I cannot get the chemicals/medicines, or I cannot have the setup necessary in the apartment where I live with my parents. Therefore, I am asking for suggestions for a method that does not require hard-to-get medicines/chemicals (like SN, N, benzos, etc.) and complicated setups (like inert gas, hanging) and can be executed in a few hours when I am outside. But i would prefer the method to be quick, painless, and 100% guaranteed, as I don't want to end up with paralysis or hospitalization.

As for why I want to CTB is because each and every single moment feels like hell to me now. I have not been able to do what I should have done in my life so far. This gives me immense shame. Thus, I do not feel comfortable talking to anyone now or socializing. My friends and classmates have progressed in their lives in all aspects personal and professional but I have not. My family members are also aware of my hopelessness and helplessness, and I feel very ashamed talking to them. Thus, CTB is important to me on an urgent basis, as it will solve all these issues, and liberate me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also possible, but not recommended: trains; trucks. (The problem with those mthods is that they could traumatise the driver.) And with a truck, at least, failure is a real possibility.)
I think you lose nothing by giving yourself more time to see how your life goes. When I was 32 (in 1985) I broke off contact with a very close friend from school. His life seemed to be going really well, and mine was not going so well. I was embarrassed. I later regretted doing that, but by then it was not possible to contact him. We had both changed addresses several times. In 2012 I managed to track him down, using the internet. It turned out that his life had fallen apart in 2000, whereas by then I had made a real success of mine. Sadly, it was not possible to repair what 27 years of no contact had done, and I have had very little contact with him since then.
Life is unpredictable. The day may come when you are doing far better than your friends and classmates. Don't rush to ctb.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

@Linda You seem to do well. What do you want to CTB?

I can't shoot with firearm. Drowning might be painful. Falling from height could be an option but getting into tall buildings and jumping from a reasonable height seems a bit fearful as I have height phobia.

Train/bus/truck may leave my body damaged thus this is not preferred option.

So, only option could be hypothermia but @Linda could you please let me know how can I do hypothermia in my context —- only have a bathtub in a bathroom and it is summer so no cold outside —- I'm in US.

I did a bit of search for hypothermia here, but did not get specifics applicable to my context.",,,,,,,,,,,,,

For SN:
I am in the USA. So, just wanted to check–
Is Ibuprofen the same as Advil? So, would this work? It has 24 tablets. Each tablet is 200mg. So, 3 tablets are needed for 600mg.
Also, is Acetaminophen the same as Paracetamol? So, would this work? It has 100 caplets. Each caplet is 500mg. It is of extra strength though. 2 caplets are needed for 1000mg.
Which one should I use —Advil or Acetaminophen?

Also, I have no idea where to get 30 mg Metoclopramide, 600 mg Oxazepam/Benzos and even SN. I found out online that Metoclopramide and Oxazepam/Benzos can be available for purchase only with PRESCRIPTION. Where can I get prescription for exactly these medicines? Is there any other way to get these medicines?

And, please help with getting the SN. I searched online but could not find any reliable source to get SN with at least 95% purity. I know discussing about sources is not allowed here. Then, what else can I do to get it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,

Need a suitable method,2584969,Agon321,"Jul 4, 2024 at 12:06 PM","Yes, Advil is ibuprofen.
Acetaminophen is paracetamol.
If I remember correctly, Advil is simply a brand of ibuprofen.

I don't know if it makes much difference what you take.
I'm going to take 600mg of ibuprofen, one hour before drinking SN.

Well, it is possible to get prescription drugs online.
For example, I ordered Domperidone from an online pharmacy.
I just had to fill out a survey.
Of course I wasn't being truthful.
I just had to wait a while for acceptance.
Domperidone came to me without any problems.
Unfortunately, the source I ordered from is no longer valid.
I also have no idea about any other source.
If you are determined, I think you will definitely find the right online pharmacy.

People on this site are reluctant to post sources.

I'm from Europe, so I don't know what the current situation is in the USA.
But I have some tips, maybe they will be useful to you.

Try looking for a source in Europe and Asia. Don't necessarily use English to search for SN.
Focus on looking in chemical stores.
Of course, SN can be bought in other places, but chemical stores are the most reliable.
Alternatively, you can try looking in butcher shops.

I don't know if my comment is helpful to you.
Unfortunately, I'm not an expert.",2584944,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, extra strength of paracetamol work? Or do we need regular strength ?",2584969,,,,,,,,,,,,
Need a suitable method,2586795,Agon321,"Jul 6, 2024 at 12:23 AM","Well, the most important thing is a clean SN (obvious).
Antiemetic is highly recommended.
All the other drugs are just to make your CTB a little smoother.

Theoretically, you can drink SN alone because the chances of success are relatively high.
There are cases of people who achieved success this way.
Definitely mentally prepare yourself for vomiting because you will most likely vomit.
It is also a good idea to prepare an additional 1-2 cups of SN.

Without antiemetics you will reduce your chance of success (I don't know how much), but ""success"" is still possible.

Pain is a matter of individual interpretation.
Without additional medications, CTB will definitely be less pleasant.
It all depends on what your pain limit is.
For some it will only be discomfort, but for others it can be very bothersome.

You must decide for yourself whether the potential symptoms are acceptable to you.

I always thought ibuprofen was a bit stronger.
Well, I don't think the choice between paracetamol and ibuprofen makes much difference.",2586298,,,,,,,,,,,,
