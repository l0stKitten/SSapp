For 4 years I deluded myself into believing I could go into this niche career with so much socialization required. But for at least 3 years, I felt so free of the terror. I could live and play pretend house, dreaming of a future that would never come. Would we own a dog when we married? What would we do when we took a trip to Japan?\\n\\nAnd now its becoming clearer that this career is not a good fit for me. Maybe no career is a good fit for me. And my boyfriend is anxious as I have been on voluntary hold already. He wants a house and maybe some healthy children that I can't give to him due to my genes. He hasn't broken up with me yet, but we have planned on moving soon.\\n\\nAnd I kind of want to end it here, in this apartment while he's out at work and I can set up a sign to call the police, instead of subjecting my parents to the horror of it all somewhere down the line.\\n\\nI don't want to go back to inpatient.
