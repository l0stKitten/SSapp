EscapeFromLife,"Is getting married before CTB a good idea? Perhaps it can be a way of recovery--- but that's very HARD. Has anyone experienced it?

Probably getting married would make things worse-- for the existing issues that are leading to CTB. So, getting married can just make things more complicated. For example, the CTB can lead investigations to the in-laws and partner, whereas doing CTB when single may only lead investigations to own parents. But, I think leaving a suicide note saying ""No one is responsible for by death"" beside the body may resue everyone from investigation.

I'm not worried for myself, but for my next of kin forced to identify my body. Just thinking about the logistics. I plan to leave my ID.

Will my family still need to identify my body? I will be shooting myself away from the home.

If yes, how messed up will my face be? I am worrying about the psychological trauma for them... Could they identify me through other means, such as a birthmark on my leg?

ijustwishtodie,"I hate at how overprotective they are as it makes it even more unlikely for me to ctb. For those who are unaware, not every culture has it where parents kick their child out as soon as they are 18. Some cultures have it where the parents make their child stay with them beyond 18. My parents are an example of this as they don't want me to be independent yet. I live with them despite being an adult and they always keep an eye on me. I can't leave the house without giving them a reason for it first nor can I leave the house during night time either due to my parents being light sleepers. And, no, don't tell me to just go outside anyway... that wouldn't work in asian culture.

This is a big deal for me because this further reduces my chances of killing myself. I just want to be dead so that I don't have to deal with life but killing myself is literally almost impossible for me. Despite me not wage slaving, I still am a slave in a lot of other ways. I'm forced to do things I don't want to do such as religious bullshit, chores, going outside with family and so on. I'm also a slave in the sense that I'm forced to survive in a life that I never wanted to begin with.

I hate the idea of independence and I don't want to be fully independent but it would be nice if I could be independent enough to where I don't have to deal with my parents reducing my chances of being dead. Though, I don't have the skills nor motivation to be independent. I just want to skip all of this bs and be dead already. I just want peace.

I really relate to what @locked*n*loaded said about FC being homebound as I'm in the same situation. Ever since he made that post, I've been thinking about it everyday and today I gained the courage to post about it. This is his post that I'm referring to:
Does anybody what happened to Funeral Cry ?
I have to say I miss FC’s never ending posts about hating existence, I wonder why I don’t see them anymore, I know some people were annoyed but I understood her pain and her hatred of existence.

I think the only way for people like us to gain some temporary freedom is to accept a little bit of wageslavery at least just long enough to gain independence from our parents. This is more like indentured servitude in practice but the idea is still there.

I needed to provide for myself when I barely knew how to when I was so young. They would barely provide any assistance financially even for my deteriorating health.

KillingPain267,"If we assume the train decapitates your head clean off, and the jumping results in your head hitting the ground directly from enough height, it would be about the same. Your brain would physically cease functioning within a second or two. But the decapitation by train might take slightly longer assuming it cut your neck rather than crushed your skull (since being cut off from the heart and lungs results in hypoxia), while smashing into the ground results in all cognitive functioning ceasing immediately. If your brain stem and thalamus survives the impact of hitting the ground from a jump, you may be conscious for a little while just like with the train decapitation though.","Jul 17, 2024 at 5:58 PM",,2599873,A genuine question for discussion,,,,,,,,43,1,2024-10-02T03:47:53.737401Z,37,117.374,method,2024-10-02T18:25:39.000909Z,5
FallingGrace,"I wouldn't do either but if I had to pick, I'd for sure go train.
Jumping:
Risk of tumbling during free fall, re-positioning the body to feet-first rather than head-first
Risk of intervention (roof access, good Samaritans below and above)
Risk of environment below changing during attempt, especially in urban area (cars or people, killing bystanders, concrete becoming more shock-absorptive metal slightly increases chances of survival)
Risk of environment below impeding death (impalement on an otherwise unseen obstacle would lead to a considerably slower death)
Time spent free-falling may in itself could be considered painful
Messy but can be somewhat contained depending on the area done in
Time: relatively quick. If unseen, SI can be handled on your own clock and then it's a matter of seconds when you've jumped, granted you jumped high enough to cause fatal injuries.
Train:
High lethality if done correctly (positioning neck over track etc)
Train cannot be stopped easily/long break distance, reducing intervention risk
Minimal risk of killing any bystanders (just mentally scarring them, I guess)
Messy for everyone involved (especially so if you just straight up jump full body in front of one)
Time: complicated. Trains have differing frequencies depending where you are, or a station vs just a random line. They are also protected by trespassing laws. Once you do it though, I imagine it's lights out pretty quickly unless you fuck it up.

locked*n*loaded,"I think your best shot at a train ctb would certainly be at night, and in a remote area. You really need to start with a stopped train. Eventually, that train is going to start moving again. It shouldn't make any difference which railcar you choose. I'd choose one away from the engine though.

phersper,"I wasn't warned, I wasn't warned by my psychiatrist that I could end up like that, agonizing every minute of every second of every single day.

Antidepressants and other psych drugs damaged my brain and put me in a position I wouldn't wish not even to my worst enemy.

My sexuality has been obliterated: total loss of libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced sensitivity in genitalia, pleasureless orgasms. Sadly that's just the tip of the iceberg. The main problem here is that my body cannot produce any kind of pleasurable feeling because of the malfunctioning of the brain reward system. I know it seems like it can't be real, but trust me, I can't really enjoy not even a single thing in my life because my reward/dopamine pathaway has been somehow altered. I can't feel hungry or enjoy a (good) meal, I can't feel the endorphins rush/good sensations after a sport session, I can't feel the effect of most drugs (coffee, nicotine, alcohol, heroin, you name it…). My body is always in a state of tension (or light akathisia) thus I never ever fully relax, no matter how hard I worked or did exercise that day, I have persistent insomnia and my sleep is more like a shift in consciousness than real deep resting sleep. I'm always weak and tired. Except for some rare bursts of rage or sadness, I lost my emotional range, I can't really feel emotional pain, true sadness, joy, happiness, tranquility. There's no atmosphere anymore in the world, everything became grey, muted. There's no motivation, no drive, no emotions, no pleasure in every activity I once loved, like spending time with my friends and family, go out for a drink, cuddling my beloved dog, playing my favourite sports, watching my favourite movies, reading a good book, getting a full body massage, hiking in the beautiful swiss alps, etc. (the list has no end). On top of that I also suffer from a certain degree of cognitive decline, I struggle to read, sometimes I stumble upon words, I can't concentrate, I really feel like I lost part of my intelligence and I'm definitely not as brilliant as I used to be. I had to quit University 6 months prior to get my master's degree because my brain was not capable to perform at the required level.

It's been a year I'm off the meds which caused me pssd and everything almost stayed the same. Some things have slightly improved, others got worse. What is clear is that I became an empty shell, the shadow of my former self, a dead soul in a living body.
I really want to live because I had everything I wished for before I got PSSD (and believe me, I worked very hard and I overcame loads of shit just to get to that point), but at the same time I want to die as badly as I can. In these last months, where I had a bit more physical energy I tried to do regular exercise, to be socially more active, to better my diet, to force my self to have a more positive look at the future. But still, no matter the efforts, there's never some sort of reward or real improvements in my condition. I've been severely anxious and depressed in the past, but that was a walk in the park compared to this full blown PSSD. Today, in the first place, my brain does not produce the required neurotransmitters in order to be goal driven, to have motivation, to enjoy things. Second of all, even if I put all my effort in order to be active and take part in different activities, there's not even a single drop of reward in return.

So what's the point of going on? I really can't get it. I don't know if you, reading this post, can grasp how hard and strenuous and depressing is to live with this condition, but I really hope you do.
I always fought hard in my life, no matter what, if I had to overcome an obstacle or if I wanted something, I always worked twice as harder as the others in order to reach my goal. But now… now even if I put all my effort, even if I give my 1000% to better my situation, the outcome will always be the same, no positive change, outcome or temporary feeling whatsoever.

As most people with PSSD I've been gaslighted by every psychiatrists. I even attempted to unalive myself once and I've been labelled as psychotic (even though I clearly wasn't) in a matter of minutes from the psychiatrist at the state mental hospital. There I was given tons of antipsychotics to the point I was barely able to talk, walk straight, keep my vision from going double, swallow food, tap on the iPhone keyboard, writing, sit still, etc.

Anyway the bad story is not over, I could go on recalling all the shit and the injustices I had to face in the last twelve months, because of pssd and because of being wrongly labelled as psychotic and forced on strong medications, but that's not the point of my thread.

Actually, I don't know what's the purpose of this post. I guess I'm looking for some sort of approval for my decision of ending it all… but most likely I just need to vent, to tell somebody how tired and agonizing I am.

I believe in reincarnation and I've been thought that ctb is never a solution, but gosh, that's just too much to tolerate. I look at my situation as if I was prisoner who's physically tortured daily since one year and who finally managed to fabricate a rope to hang himself in his cell, how could God blame (or punish) this poor prisoner for taking his own life?

I'm sorry for the lack of introduction or conclusion to this text, I hope it's not confusing. The thing is that I'm just venting, putting my flow of sad thoughts into words.

I wish everybody here to recover and go back to live their life to the fullest leaving suicidal ideations as a thing of the past, but just one last thing: please be careful when it comes to psychiatric drugs, think twice before starting any therapy, look up all the possible (short and long term) side effects, discuss it seriously with your entourage and make a true informed choice.

It was not as bad as PSSD but still quite serious. I feel like a checklist of symptoms doesn't even do it justice because it's unlike any normal feelings someone might experience. It's a disturbing malfunction like something is fundamentally broken. There's no warning that something like that might occur because doctors aren't even aware of it.

MatrixPrisoner,"I have been on low dose Adderall for the past 4 years. 5 to 7.5mg a day. I think it, along with the plethora of other SSRIs under the sun that I have tried, has finally messed up my dopamine pathways as well, where anhedonia has set in. Adderall used to be the supreme anti-depressant that I could instantly feel the effects of, but sadly that is no longer the case.

When I was on Venlafaxine my libidio was completely stripped. But it wasn't such a bad thing because Adderall made me horny as hell. The inability to be sexually aroused was good for my sexual frustrations. Luckily shortly after gettting off it, my libido recovered somewhat.

For what it's worth, you may want to give magnesium supplements a shot for your sleep complications.

baabbaabbaab,"Same as you : PSSD, akathisia, dysautonomia + POTS and an handful of other joyful symptoms and diagnostics. I didn't know that human suffering could reach such a point where suicide is the only answer.

Akathisia should be a perfect reason for assisted suicide, yet, since it's not recognized or diagnosed, it will (and still is) be labelled as a psychiatric disorder though your nervous system has been damaged, injured...

Suicidebydeath,"I think I might have PSSD, I looked at the symptoms here:
Post-SSRI Sexual Dysfunction (PSSD) - RxISK
Post-SSRI sexual dysfunction (PSSD) is a condition in which sexual function does not return to normal after the use of SSRIs and related antidepressants.
rxisk.org

And I have most of them except ED and possibly decreased libido. Basically all of the tactile symptoms. It does suck. I think I was on citalopram once, I don't remember if it was before or after, it was a long time ago. It also sucked because it didn't do anything/didn't work anyway. I've reported it a few times:

1. The first time I was told it was normal. So I ignored it for a long time.
2. I spoke to a friend on a social app and he said it wasn't normal. So the second time I reported it I was told it was probably a mental block of stimulus and was told to take a Viagra alternative. Again which did absolutely nothing.
3. I've also mentioned it recently, this time to a male doctor, and he told me to make an appointment about it, I haven't yet.

As far as I can google, it's untreatable and the only thing you can do is prevent getting it in the first place. I basically suffer from full anhedonia and while I can live with that, I think it would've been nice to be able to feel things, and have a bit of motivation too. I don't know whether I got PSSD from drugs (it's possible my family drugged me without my knowledge & consent, I come from abusive family anyway), or something else though.

beforeistoolate,"Some of the most important antiemetic tips I've collected over the last year:

Bland, dry, and crunchy foods, low-fat foods, protein-rich foods, and cold foods to relieve nausea. BRAT (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast) is a physician-recommended bland diet to manage nausea and vomiting. Ginger can reduce nausea by stimulating the contraction of the stomach muscles and accelerating gastric emptying and intestinal transit of food. Studies have shown ginger extracts reduce the frequency of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting in breast cancer patients. If you are experiencing nausea, eating starchy foods such as bread, rice, plain noodles, and potatoes can help absorb stomach acids. Avoid acidic fruits such as citrus fruits. Fiber slows gastric emptying.

Demonstrated that dried ginger powder products contained the highest quantity of gingerol-related compounds (7–14 mg/g), followed by fresh ginger (2–2.8 mg/g). Studies recommend a safe daily dose of 1000 mg. 500 mg three times daily for three to five days, and motion sickness 1000 mg for one hour before start of travel. The US Food and Drug Administration generally recognized as safe list states that up to 4 g of ginger can be consumed daily. The effects of ginger were not significantly different from those obtained to metoclopramide.

Avoiding lying down during and after meals, stay upright or gentle exercise for a minimum of 2 hours after eating.

Moreover, we know that bitter taste slows gastric emptying, a correlate of nausea. Bitter taste is strongly sensed by the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves.

Avoid excessive physical activity while fasting, because it can increase the risk of getting stomach acid. Avoid acidic foods like citrus fruits, tomato sauce, soda.

On the morning of medical aid in dying, clear liquids, tea, or coffee (with no dairy added) are fine, but not solid foods and especially no fat at all (delays gastric emptying). Large volumes of liquid that may fill the stomach should be strictly avoided. Frequent small sips are allowed. Dehydration causes the stomach to produce more acid, which slows down digestion.

An antiemetic, metoclopramide, was taken by 39 out of the 60 cases during the 24 hours preceding the planned time for self-deliverance, every 6-8 hours a 10 mg tablet. None of them vomited. Vomiting was reported in 2 of the 21 cases without metoclopramide, but in spite of this the patient died. (Netherlands Exit data). The cannabinoid agonists, corticosteroids and benzodiazepines also have antiemetic actions.

When you're dehydrated, it can take about three times as long (45 minutes) for fluids to make their way from the stomach into the bloodstream and to the rest of the body. That's because dehydration causes the stomach to produce more acid, which slows down digestion.","Mar 27, 2024 at 11:03 AM",,2430336,ANTIEMETIC Guide,,,,,,,,95,1,2024-10-02T18:31:37.525556Z,89,38.873,method,2024-10-02T18:31:37.525556Z,5

JenX,"Lack of sleep definitely causes a drop in IQ, along with a gazillion other problems. Including feeling depressed… Getting sunlight in your eyeball during the day helps create vitamin D2 which helps for sleep. As long as you're getting saturated fat in your diet. All hormones are made from fats… including melatonin. Not good to take this as a supplement but very good when your body makes it from cholesterol/D2. Our bodies are amazing if we feed it the right stuff… Also magnesium. It's estimated more than 80% of people at least in the US are deficient because our food supply and the crappy way Americans eat. lol. Anyways you want to eat whole foods and try to limit processed food. Exercise helps of course..

When the reality of my financial situation finally hit, I had trouble sleeping and taking magnesium really really helps. I take magnesium lysinate glycinate. Inexpensive, get on Amazon. Doesn't make you have loose bowels. That's always a plus. Valerian root also helps you fall asleep, it's an herb. Very safe.

Try not to drink coffee after 5 PM. If you must, put a couple L-theanines in it. This is a protein amino acid that can chill you out on its own… It will nullify the caffeine.

* I can't believe I forgot blue light. It is so bad to be exposed to your TV screens pcs and phones within an hour before you want to fall asleep. We're pretty programmed to do that now though so it's pretty hard to step away… You can get $5 blue blocking Glasses on Amazon.

EvisceratedJester,"Yes, sleep deprivation can have long-term effects. It can lead to memory problems, weight gain, increased risk of certain chronic health problems such as heart disease and kidney disease, increased risk of depression and other mental health problems, increased risk of injury, loss of productivity, etc. I don't know much about its potential impact on IQ.

lamargue,"i think the importance of sleep underlines the importance of remedial intervals in whatever you are doing, whether that be exercise, study, etc., though sleep is obviously rooted in a much deeper biological function. proper intervals accord with the needs of the body

but cognitive decline as a result of sleep deprivation differs for many people. for me nutrition and periods of the day play a larger role in my brain fog. for instance, even if i have stayed up for a very long time, i may only get symptoms of brain fog during very specific intervals of the day. the mornings where i had previously stayed up all night are typically very clear to me. in any case, it doesn't usually result in a permanent decrease in your cognitive power (unless you have been awake for a very, very long time). the quickest paregoric would be just to modify your own sleep schedule","Jun 29, 2024 at 9:58 AM",,2578995,Does sleep deprivation make you dumber?,,,,,,,,173,1,2024-10-02T18:56:29.752501Z,167,37.025,supportive,2024-10-02T18:56:29.752501Z,5
Josh007,It can increase the risk of diseases. From the studies I've heard it causes virtually irreversible damage on the brain. You can reverse some of that damage by making up for lack of sleep within a week. However you lose problem solving ability which can't really be recovered.

DOHARDTHINGS24,"Hi
Does anyone have any advice on using Prochlorperazine as an AE??
As in dosing?
I see it is in both Stan's & the bible. I can't use meto due to drug interactions apparently.
And I can't open any links to stuff on here because my ex is still in my iPhone & the rest so I'm only opening pages like Stan's that don't have any additional ""click here"" style links because I don't know what he has access to - I found this week that it was even more than I thought which is sickening, TBH.
I have Prochlorperazine maleate 5mg drugs. 24 tablets. Expired 2021.
It is unlikely I'll be able to get any other AE in my time frame unless the 400mg of quetiapine that I take daily counts.
Stan & the bible say no meds for seasickness - the Prochlorperazine maleate was prescribed for seasickness.
The internet said pills are still good if they're not crumbling or smelly or whatever but can have reduced efficacy. Everyone on here said to do a dry run of whatever AE you choose to see if side effects. I took one of my Prochlorperazine a few days ago - zero side effects - is this good? As in not allergic? Or is this bad? As in they don't work anymore? I did not take any when I was prescribed because they were given to me just in case I got seasick & I didn't get seasick.
Does anyone know the dosing of Prochlorperazine for either the 48 hour regimen or stat dose?? Am hoping for 48 hours but will definitely do stat dose if required.
And on top of what is the normal advice, if I should be taking more or sooner or whatever to counteract how old they are???
Apologies for asking this - I know I keep on saying it over & over but it's true - it's simply not viable or safe for me to do much in the way of independent research. I have no physical or digital privacy & SaSu is my legit only source of both info & support. Which sucks. But you guys have been rock stars.
So if anyone knows what PPH says or anyone else about Prochlorperazine maleate 5mg, please let me know. And without it being a link or anything I have to click.
So sorry. I hate being like this - it goes against every part of me. And I freak out that someone might've already sent me info & be offended or whatever - I have to go back through my threads & convos & write notes - so far I've only managed to write notes on Stan & bible - iPhone plus no privacy plus no safety plus only handwriting plus ADHD plus ill health plus plus plus - it's making this too hard for me. I really am sorry.
So if anyone can flick me something here or privately from a legit source like PPH, I'd be over the goddamn moon. And so very bloody grateful. Please. Thank you. Sorry.","Jul 17, 2024 at 8:06 PM",,2599995,Prochlorperazine DOSING as AE,,,,,,,,179,1,2024-10-02T18:59:14.178968Z,173,52.333,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thinking about how you might do this?"",""thoughts and some intention of acting on them?"",""started to work or did you intent to carry out this plan?"",""high risk"",""method""]}",2024-10-02T18:59:14.178968Z,3

Defenestration,"Does this site prevent unintentional suicides?

good evening, this is in no way a criticism but we are quite a lot of people having been here for 1 year or more waiting for the perfect method, wanting to plan everything, knowing, which means that in the end we spend a lot of time think and ultimately we lack spontaneity
and this blocks us when taking action.

this site is truly EXTRAORDINARY and that's why it allowed people to leave peacefully, particularly with the SN...

but I remember that before being registered there I was more naive and I was less afraid of a failed suicide, there it was because I wanted everything control I have lost my suicidal spontaneity. by that I mean that I am never sure enough etc...

Kali_Yuga13,"Right under the users avatar you can see their join date. Some people have been here for years. I've lurked around for many months. It's a bit distressing to see when young people post about wanting to ctb. Hopefully in many cases it's more about venting. Part of the problem is society and their non-education in understanding passive vs active ideation. Once suicide enters the conversation no one wants to be on the hook emotionally, socially or legally for not getting authorities involved.

The channels for anonymous are few. All I know of is reddit, tis and something for older people. It would probably be a good idea to steer people with passive ideation to a place that isn't mixed with active planners. There is a recovery section here but it's a systemic communication and acceptance problem.

Done with my parents, done with shitty overwhelming jobs, done with depression and anxiety, done with PTSD, just done with living. If I had a place to go (don't have the money for a hotel at the moment) I would be dying tonight.

3/4Dead,"adding on again.
I'm so exhausted I can't even begin to describe it. Worked a 12 hour shift today and everytime I had a lapse in customers all I could think about was dying. How I'll do it, where I'll do it, what I'll say in my notes. Jesus christ, when I decide on a method I think all bets are off at that point.

I'm currently leaning towards a method but It's rather undignifed, and the only place I could think to do it would be a large park in a tent, where I can easily direct authorities, be away from anyone finding me, and if isolated enough go uninterupted. My city has a large homless population so one new tent in a park wouldn't likely raise suspicion.

I'll do a little research on the method I'm considering and go from there, but dying is almost all I'm thinking about really. Honestly if I had the spare money for some booze or pot that might help me think clearer, im joking a little but a good buzz really might set me back straight. I don't know.

DefinitelyReady,"Yeah, prep for making a call or going out is always something I do. I have to visual it and account for things that can happen. So it's like being scared to high dive, or for me even low dive. You have to build up the courage. It sucks; and we have to do this for ""other people"" we don't even know or will never talk to again, which sucks even more. Which pisses me off so that sometimes helps. Anger can be a motivator if correctly used. Identifying how ridiculous a fear is that wtf should I fear it? But you can't just do it the one time. You have to ""practice."" Yeah, practice being a person... I tried edibles (didn't help) but I was microdosing everyday. I told my therapist this and was like, ""So I have to get myself essentially a little ""high"" everyday, just to be a person?"" She didn't think there was anything wrong with that and people do a lot of things to stay sane as a person. I thought ""Well hell. Seth Rogen is talented and successful yet he is like always high so...."" and I didn't even like the edibles.

Social anxiety is very complex. I equate it to performance anxiety. I was always terrified to read aloud when it was ""my turn"" in elementary. Same with public speaking. I could die from high blood pressure if I tried to sing in front of people. Shopping amongst strangers and having them interrupt you doesn't seem all that different to me if you think about it. You're not prepared, people could be staring at you at any moment, or randomly ask if you need anything at any moment. Then you're not prepared and fear takes over and it's hard to concentrate and take in what they're saying, let alone come up with a response on the spot. That's a performance to me. Usually ""normal"" people don't give a damn unless you're in their way. If you look shakey, they may just wonder if you're physically okay... Other people dont think like this. We're tragic lol; or if they do think like this it's to a much less intense degree of stress. It's an art lol, to actively not care. The reasons why we do are nuanced and varied. It's the same in the virtual world. This site can still stress you from the anticipation and ill-percieved judgement and ridicule that may or may not come. All the same rules still apply, just by design of internet rules. Make your own rules. Get pissed off for having such rules forced upon you lol.

Kali_Yuga13,"In the past year or so I've come to the conclusion that almost my entire life has been wrong. I delved into all aspects of time travel to change things but alas, here I am in the same timeline that should not be.

Because I'm in the wrong life, each step forward is a step deeper into the forest of regret. This has caused a curious condition where each day is the worst day of my life due to the cumulative weight of the preceding days. This feeling can even be felt in real time as each moment being worse than the preceding one. I manage to do some healthy behaviors and distract myself from the moment-by-moment torture but the overall day feeling is there. I feel like a racoon with it's paw caught in a trap on the verge of gnawing off it's leg to survive except my life itself is the paw and ""survival"" entails not being here anymore.

Of course this isn't they type of thing I can share with others. Even if I bring up time travel or regrets the subject gets shooed away. I am trying to muster the energy and focus to methodically put my affairs in order.

AgentAlaniKelso,"I find myself back here again on this page, again hoping for support, but this time for a different reason. In previous posts, I shared what was happening with me and how close I came to finally setting myself (and others) free from the burden of my existence. I look back on those two posts now and it truly breaks my heart to see how bad I was hurting and how desperate I was for ANY kind of connection. Things have improved but I still feel like there is more work to do.

I'm here asking for help. I'm so tired of feeling like things would be better if I were gone. I DONT want to be gone. I want to live to be crusty, old, cantankerous, live for more than a hundred years. I just turned 40 this year (I NEVER thought I would make it to 40...) and the thought of living the next thirty, forty, fifty or more years feeling this way is a torment. In the past, I felt I deserved to feel like my life was worthless and I was worthless. Finally, I know that's not true, I believe in my soul that's not true. But I just cant beat the thought of, ""Just walk over to the safe and pull out the gun - It will be over before you even feel it."" To be honest, these thoughts have been a significant obstacle to me feeling like I can live my life as my true self.

I want help but I know sharing my truth with my PCP or therapist triggers, shall we say, processes that ostensibly are meant to keep someone ""safe."" I've worked in healthcare long enough to know what happens when someone expresses ideation or thoughts of self harm. Hell, in the past it has been ME who has started the ball rolling on involuntary holds and involuntary custody for ""safety."" The systems we have in place to ""help"" result in people losing their rights, losing access to their possessions, losing access to their firearms, losing access to their unrestricted freedom, and potentially losing jobs/housing. The systems that are meant to ""help"" result in MORE hardship and turmoil than if someone simply keeps their mouth shut. And that's bullshit.

I want help but I refuse to have my rights restricted. I'm not losing my job, my guns, my freedom, my livelihood, my lifestyle, my purpose - for me, those restrictions are worse than feeling the way I've felt for the last almost 30 years. I know if I tell my therapist how I truly feel about things that my life will forever change and not for the better. I truly want help but the fear of losing everything I've worked so hard for is holding me back from getting that help.

Does anyone know how I can speak my authentic and real truth (rather than the censored version) without risking everything? Can/should I tell my therapist what my fear is if I tell the ""whole"" truth? I trust her, but all it takes is one call to unravel everything.

Illegal Preclear,"The ""choking game"" is actually one of my biggest inspirations for choosing hanging as my CTB method. Yeah! People not only do it for fun, but some get erotic pleasure out of it! David Carradine literally had an orgasmic hanging. Granted, that wasn't his goal but I wish everyone here who has chosen hanging could have that!

The ""choking game"" is mentioned in the Japanese Suicide Handbook (which I recommend EVERYONE read) - There was a Japanese doctor who was studying hanging to see EXACTLY what it felt like before you died (thank you for your service, doctor!) and he did it to the point of passing out to the point where his fellow doctors had to revive him - but according to this doctor it was very peaceful.

That being said - I think people respond to it differently. There are some people who will feel a rope around their neck and have an automatic panic response. And...there are some, as previously mentioned, who enjoy it to the point of being addicted to it.

As far as my experience goes - I practice with the rope I intend to use when the big day comes - I tie my hair to the side, put the noose right under the jawline, visualizing where the arteries that need closing are, hold the length of rope upward with my dominant hand and let my head hang loose, trying to simulate as close as possible to what the actual hanging will feel like. There's a 'pounding' type feeling that goes along with my pulse and I feel all the veins in my face going wild. I've never done it to the point of passing out, which I NEED to because I'm planning on swinging this September. I'm planning on practicing today again. Last time I decided to see if drinking a bunch of liquor would aid the process - bad idea. I gave myself such a huge migraine. But when I normally do it - the feeling is not exactly comfortable, but not that scary and I can see myself being able to do it until I pass out.

Also - I agree with OP in that the rush of endorphins you get after you let go feels REALLY COOL.","Jul 9, 2024 at 6:12 PM",,2590984,How to make yourself LOOSE CONCIOUSNESS (the choking game?)?,,,,,,,,352,1,2024-10-03T04:56:48.067077Z,346,35.748,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thinking about how you might do this?"",""thoughts and some intention of acting on them?"",""started to work or did you intent to carry out this plan?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-03T04:56:48.067077Z,3

If you've got an idea of who will manage your burial (the funeral home or otherwise) you could reach out to them and inquire anon (it might also be on their website if they have one), if you're not sure specifically I'd say look into what's nearby your family that they may decide to use for transportation and burial to get a rough estimate.

DEATH IS FREEDOM,"The survival instinct keeps life alive. The survival instinct does not want life to die. The society does not want humans to die. Global average life expectancy is 73 years. Humans are now living longer than ever before. The average lifespan of the ancient Greeks and Romans was 20 to 35 years. Modern medicine keeps people alive longer than our ancestors. People have jobs that do not wear out the body. Man has no other enemies than diseases and his fellow men. Human euthanasia is illegal in most countries. Many people think about suicide to avoid pointless suffering. But not everyone succeeds in dying by suicide because suicide is difficult and the body is not made to kill itself. However, if you do not die of suicide, there is the risk of dying of old age. Maybe there are people who want to die of old age, but I myself want to escape this terrible suffering with the ailments of old age and the decay of the body.

According to his papers, Mbah Ghoto in Indonesia, was born in December 1870. But Indonesia only started recording births in 1900. Mbah Ghoto survived four wives and all his children. In the last years of his life they had to wash him and feed him with spoon because he was getting weaker and weaker. Moreover, he could not stand upright because his back was bent. When Mbah Ghoto was 122 years old, he began to prepare for his death and made a tombstone. Mbah Ghoto waited for death for a very long time.

I'm trying to hold things together and not make an impulsive suicide attempt as I've done that already in the last week and like I always say to people on here, it doesn't work. But I have self harmed already this morning and it's only ten o'clock.

I know I've just got to ride it out, that never mind what one part of my brain is telling me, that these are memories not current events but part of what's getting to me is the lack of understanding from other people. None of the LGBTQ+ people I know have experienced anything directly in years and straight people are sympathetic but don't and can't understand the fear of wondering if the person who looks at you for too long in the shop is going to say something, maybe in the car park where it's quiet.

Just hoping there's someone on here who understands.","Jul 17, 2024 at 4:04 AM",,2599199,Flashbacks of homophobia,,,,,,,,399,1,2024-10-03T05:12:37.399770Z,393,62.096,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""started to work or did you intent to carry out this plan?"",""done, started or prepared to do anything to end your life?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-03T05:12:37.399770Z,3

Qua,"Around a month ago I stopped taking my antidepressants for a few weeks (I kept forgetting to take them, then didn't have strength) and my mental health spiraled down. I haven't felt this bad for a long time, no breaks, in a few years. Always when I broke down it would last maximum a couple hours. Here, however, without my medication it kept going and kept getting worse with each day.
I'm feeling better now since I started taking my meds again, but here comes the question: why do I want to go back to that state? English is not my first language and so can't wrap in words how bad I've been feeling, how really low I was. I started self harming again, abusing calming medication to drug myself so I don't feel anything. Thoughts of suicide were so loud in my head I think If I hadn't taken my meds again I would've been dead by now.
Of course I still feel bad. I'm still depressed and family issues keep being the biggest and most harmful problem that I can't escape, but I'm nowhere close to the state I've been in before. Why do I want to come back to it? To make myself struggle, to make myself break down completely?

Just lay close to the ground where the heavy Argon gas accumulates and should theoretically work similarly to the Sarco (Which uses nitrogen but argon is more available and works just as well. Most important difference is that it is heavier than air, whereas nitrogen is lighter. So argon has more a tendency to pool up near the ground.

Not A Fan,"It's not really established.. more just a concept I am looking into.

People exploring inert gas, often seem to get hung up on some detail that caused the exit bag not to inflate properly, or the mask doesn't work right or something. It's the kind of of thing where any small oversight could sabotage the entire plan. I've witnessed threads on this forum, of people going back and forth trying to figure out why their setup isn't working. They seem to have done everything correctly, and end up wasting so much gas on failed tests and troubleshooting, trying to figure out why their setup isn't working the same as everyone else's.

I'm reasonably confident I could build a functioning mask apparatus, but I feel like it's also not aesthetically ideal. It doesn't feel natural to put a bag over one's head. The Sarco is one way to avoid this -- you just just sit in it and breathe -- but due to regulatory hurdles, it is unlikely to be available in my country in my lifetime.

Argon's tendency to settle close to the ground means you should be able to lie down in your sleeping bag, and as long as the tent is well-sealed, and enough argon is released, you would basically pass out in a couple breaths... without having to put on a mask or bag. One question on this would be: how quickly would it dissipate? What exactly amount would the minimum needed for a given interior volume (of the tent or other enclosed chamber.)

One thing that has concerned me about argon, unlike nitrogen, people who had tested their exit bags complained on nausea lasting for a few hours after breathing it. But then today I read that when people inhale argon by accident, they're suggested to breathe while hanging upside down in order to expel the heavier-than-air argon that has settled at the bottom of their lungs. That probably causes nausea or dizziness or headaches if you don't take care of it. So it's not that there's anything toxic about argon. It is just as ""inert"" as nitrogen in terms of how it (doesn't) react with your body.

But if you are going unconscious and don't plan on waking up again, that is quite immaterial. But I guess if you don't wanna feel gross after testing your setup, stand on your head for 5 minutes. But it seems like potentially the tent and the argon could be the best of both worlds. Personally I think inert gas hypoxia would be the cleanest death experience... maybe I put too much importance on it though. when youre dead, youre dead","Jul 8, 2024 at 8:46 AM",2589369,2589378,TENT,,,,,,,,423,1,2024-10-03T05:20:35.985556Z,417,25.107,"{""choices"":[""done, started or prepared to do anything to end your life?"",""high risk"",""method""]}",2024-10-03T05:20:35.985556Z,3

Mitch3ll,"Hi Friends.

New member and first post. I struggle with reading, writing and concentration as my brain hurts and my vision not so good (hard to read with double vision and no corrective lenses). So I've tried to read the rules as best I can and searched best I can but man o man is it exhausting and overwhelming for someone like me.

But I live in Western Canada, big city on the coast of British Columbia to be exact and I am inspired by the MaxDog nitro brewing setup. Lots of kits and whatnot out there to make all sorts of great stuff with the gas, yet I am unsure on where do people like me acquire the gas for such home brew projects ? In the states and elsewhere it all seems really easy, maybe it's easy here too but I'm just missing it.

Any suggestions for where to get my kit started and best size bottle and regulator that is available in my region would be appreciated. I tried looking up regulators but my search just shows me CO2 stuff and it's again, with my learning disabilities it's a massive struggle to wade through this stuff.

Please keep it simple as too much is overwhelming. I' really enjoy gin and I've heard that a nitro infused Gin is super smooth and really brings out the botanical flavours and hopefully I can try it out before I'm homeless once again this Oct.

lainpilled,"Hello SaSu, today I wanted to let some of my feelings out with a post, specifically feeling isolated and alone and generally feeling like everyone ignores your presences; that you feel invisible to everyone around you. I'll likely get into some of my personal trauma, so warning for abuse, neglect, and sexual assault. With that out of the way, time for my rambling.
I've had and still do have the urge to CTB, though I've found reasons as to not do as such. Still, I grew up alone and bullied in an unstable household with no one to turn to and this is still true even when I'm about to turn 20 on the 24th of this month. Despite doing my best to be friendly, kind, funny, smart, strong, and pretty with me getting called that, i still find that I am not enough for people and that I'm doomed to be constantly isolated and it hurts. I don't ask for much yet I feel like the biggest burden in the world, taking up space to the point where my own grandmother called me a waste of space. She's a bitch who removed me from her will because I came out about getting s/a'd by her favorite grandchild. I was a toddler and he was a teen. In school I was considered the weird girl, I was even told this to my face, it's strange because all that was different about me was the fact I was depressed from my parent's constant drinking and having to deal with all the police and blood and my stepdad leaving us. I dealt with too much in life and getting bullied and used in school didn't help. It was highschool when I made some friends, not that i didn't have friends before but we grew apart after middle school. The new friends I found were gamer boys who had never been friends with a girl before, and they all developed crushes on me. To learn my dearest friends were lusting for me, to the point of uploading a song about it on Spotify hurt. It really hurt and I haven't recovered from it. Even now as I try my best to be a good friend, a good sister, a good daughter, I feel as if I'm being used and manipulated by those around me and even with the support I have, I find myself just constantly hurting and lonely. Last night I had a fun time in the chats talking to various people, everyone here is so nice, I feel understood by those here. Thank you.
I didn't expect this post to be this long, but I want to tell people to be there for one another, everyone here is lonely and hurting so please extend kindness to others. <3","Jul 17, 2024 at 1:53 PM",,2599619,,,,,,,,,494,1,2024-10-05T02:00:21.100236Z,488,141.283,"{""choices"":[""1 wish to be death?"",""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thinking about how you might do this?"",""medium risk"",""supportive""]}",2024-10-05T02:00:21.100236Z,2

Sylveon,"I don't know what my incentive is to keep dragging on. I tried everything I think I possibly could have, right from the academics: I went from scoring in single digits in my entrances to being in the top 6 or so percent of my country (not trying to brag, it's nowhere near as cool as it sounds), completely cut off social media, got rid of my binge eating habit completely, tried taking better care of my body, from my ugly face to fitness, learned how to drive (not four-wheelers, but better than nothing, I'd say), tried getting back into video games and art, and what not.

The point is, I put in so much effort just to live normally, and it honestly landed me nowhere. I feel like I'm even worse off than I was before. At least back when I used to waste my days playing video games, I could easily subside these feelings as per my will, but that privilege is long gone. I can't believe it's been three years since even that.

People around me don't have to put in half as much effort; they aren't afraid of social situations; can talk normally without being awkward or coming off as pahtetic or desperate; are actually decent-looking; have friends who actually prefer them; don't make a fuss over the pettiest of stuff; and somehow manage to keep their heads up at all times. Why don't I get any of this? All that effort just to still end up at square one—why should I keep going? I don't even wanna leave my room anymore, but who am I kidding? I'll just be told the same old ""everyone does it, so you'll have to as well,"" ""stop using your phone,"" ""just find a hobby,"" ""we have high hopes for you,"" ""you gotta do this, you gotta do that,"" ""just man up..."" I'm done with all this.

Thanks to God in the past week for reminding me how I have never been and how I will never be someone's first choice. I'm through... I genuinely wanna carve something insane on my skin so that people will leave me alone forever. I may as well commit to being a freak physically too; maybe then I'll never have to deal with life again, as long as I'm still alive.

Moved all over the country for jobs, gone back to uni in my late 20's, tried regular jobs, tried Head of Department jobs, tried freelance. Tried being healthy, self help books, a more balnced life, a life committed to work.

The shittiest thing I find is that I still feel this pressure that I didn't try hard enough. I guess that comes from parents. But, it's really been getting to me the past year. Like- why am I doing all this? Why am I putting myself through all this? All for the sake of other people basically. So I don't end up a burden on my parents. When, they landed me with all these problems to begin with. I just find it ironic really.

I try to exercise every day because I find it does help me overall but, I hate it! It's just stuff like that that pisses me off about life. Like- yes- it's still a choice. I could just not do it.

HelpDoesNotExist,"There is no point in even talking about it with anyone else unless they're in the exact same situation.
They tell you you can't feel guilty forever even when anything else would be insane. That it's possible to stop wondering how that person's doing
And then they insist on arguing you're just depressed or that you're not trying hard enough not to think about it, ostensibly because they care when really it's just their job because they spawned you
Once you make the one person who did care stop, and know it's your fault, it's impossible to care about yourself.
Why should I appreciate ""help"" that is just pills that don't work or make it worse, useless advice on things they dont understand or useless therapy or threats of hospital (despite you telling them over and over what can happen in those places) or restrictions of finances so you can't buy the one temporary escape that ever works? Why should I care what happens after I'm dead, if they're upset? Life's not fair. I didn't ask to be born.

Iloveher,"Hello , I am 40 male. Most of my life has been a disappointment. Havent achieved much in life really and it feels like life passed me by. However, I have made my peace with this , I embraced nihilism years ago. I have considered CTB for many years, had a few attempts that ended up with me puking out pills or chickening out in the last moment. Anyway, my family's cats (we've had many) have become my only comfort in this dull yet full of suffering world. But even they leave me one by one due to old age or illness which has made me want to wait until the last one leaves me and then end it all.
Anyway this has been my story until a few months ago.

This is when I met HER.
Her , I dont know why the universe put her in my path , until her I knew how it will all play out and I was at peace with it Her, this girl at work , most beautiful girl ive ever seen , most perfect girl from every angle I look at her ,polite , sweet , hard working, etc. I fell in love with her about 2 weeks after I met her. She managed to change my perspective about the world , about life , about everything , just by existing. It feels like I was dead and I got an adrenaline injection in the heart that woke me up to life again. Just imagining being with her brings me so much happiness I cannot express in words , I never even imagined that one can be so happy, I never imagined one can feel like this. She really changed my perspective of life , she made me want to live, want to experience life , even grow old and live life a normie (something I never thought Id ever desire). She did all of this by just existing and being around me at work.
Now the problem. This is not a happy story unfortunatelly.

She is 20 yo , I am 40 yo. (I understand if some will judge , I respect everyone's opinion) Despite the huge age difference (she may not be aware as I really look young , I am also fit Im a gym addict) , she seems to have some interest in me , I caught her looking at me a few times , sometimes when I pass her by she smiles at me , also called me cute once when I helped her with some stuff. I am not saying she wants me but theres def. some interest even if small.
The problem is shes veeeeery beautiful . Almost every guy at work approaches her and gives her attention and she seems to enjoy attention a lot. Which has made me suffer a lot to the point that I was once so hurt because she talked to a guy for about 3 hours that I decided to ignore her and stay away from her , I didnt even want to say hello to her anymore which made her say hello to me 3 times in the same day after I ignored her twice , that has made talk to her again and made me more confident that theres a least a little bit interest on her part. Problem is this isnt enough. I am very convinced I dont have a shot with her despite any interes on her part. Shes too beautiful and popular why would she want me out of all her options ?

I really cant deal with a broken heart , if I ever see her in a relationship with someone I wont be able to cope with it , I was dead and this girl brought me back to life , she made me dream of a life I never dreamed of before. If I cant have that life I dont really want any life, and its very unlikely that I will have her.

I bought rope and I found a tree , I dont know when to do it and I am scared I will chicken out but hopefully I wont.

I welcome any opinion and advice. I want to know what you people would do if you were in my situation. I have nobody to talk to about this but you people so any opinion is appreciated.

noairtobreathe1,"I'm gonna have to be blunt here. You're just an older male colleague to her. She probably doesn't think about you at all. This obsession you have with her is unhealthy.

You can follow advice above and ask her out, like they said, it's worth a shot. But honestly? Expect rejection. I don't say this to push you further towards CTB, I am not trying to do that. Logically, she's probably just trying to be a good colleague to you. You icing her out probably just confused her and made her wonder what she did wrong professionally.

I don't think it's wise to predicate your ctb just based off a woman at work. From your post, sounds like you hardly interact with her beyond simple pleasantries. For instance if she quit, in six months would you still be thinking about her?

I understand though that sometimes we all need a singular reason to just keep on living though and fantasize over to keep us here. Not judging that.

Think about the consequences of asking her out. The rejection itself could hurt, but you might also make your workplace unbearable if she tells other colleagues and dismisses you.","Jul 17, 2024 at 1:18 PM",,2599572,Looking for any advice or opinion on my situation.

Thing is we have a lot of collegues and we could ignore each other if we choose to and it would not affect our work.

SickNSad2024,"I was in a similar situation...I am the older person in my 40s and this person in the 20s approached me. I told this person I don't mix work with my personal life and second of all I am way too old and I would rather that this person be in a relationship their own age with things in common and things they can relate to...this person claims that they have dated enough people and that I was different, that I was someone special and meant a lot to have in their life...and that while they agreed they also doesn't mix work with personal life, what if you were to match with one person in your life and that one person is the one person from work, wouldn't you chance it? I didn't want to because it is frowned upon to have personal relationships in the workplace; if we wanted to try it out, one of us would have to quit or get fired. They said no one is going to care but if it did come down to getting fired, this person would take the risk...we are also in different departments so we don't work directly together...I rejected this person at least 10 times but this person was very persistent and eventually we met for lunch a few times on the weekend outside of work, and it turned out a coworker saw us and reported it to our supervisor. Suddenly, this person denied ever having an interest in me and blamed the whole thing on me claiming I was the one pursuing them! They then blamed me for nearly putting their position at risk. I couldn't believe they lied and it made me want to kill myself because I was perfectly fine being alone. I had never considered a relationship and that person was the one who put the thought in my head and convinced me to try it, that it wouldn't hurt and if it didn't work out then it didn't work out. They were the one in the middle of a breakup...and I guess I was just the re-bound. And less than a month after we were found out, this person has already moved on to another relationship, while I am alone stuck in unspeakable pain and not understanding how that person could have lied and I fell for it and was used. Worst of all, we had agreed we would not tell anyone about the relationship, but this person ended up telling everyone. A mutual friend brought it up to me and asked how I could have fallen into that trap. I said how could I not, this person claimed they had feelings for me and that we were a perfect match. This mutual friend said while they are letting me believe I was in a relationship with them, they actually have a bunch of others they are seeing...and that it's easy for them to quickly be in a new relationship after me because I was nothing more than ""fresh meat"" but now I'm just expired milk. This person led me to think I could have a life with someone I never considered before...then they shattered that hope and dream.

I would hate for you to fall into a similar situation...if I could go back in time, I would have turned this person down. I wish it could have gone back to the way it was, instead of feeling betrayed and now both of us have bad marks on our performance evaluations.

Kali_Yuga13,"You are in the losing end of this romantic interest. While you pine away for this singular person, she enjoys fielding interest from a variety of potential suiters. While a few drops of attention from her stirs the depths of your soul, she's in an ocean of attention and it doesn't mean any significant thing for her to size you up with some looks. Your drought for romantic interest is an alien concept to her and at some point she will pick up on that and not feel special but instead feel pressured to meet some sort of expectation and recoil.
This being a work environment, it's a potential rumor mill where you can quickly become known as the office creep. If she's so fantastic she probably has a boyfriend or at least one or more fwbs. Are you ready to deal with that and be burdened by imagining her with other men? I don't mean to be a debbie downer but objectively this situation has the potential to absolutely crush you and being that you're already on this site, perhaps it's not a good idea to pursue her.","Jul 28, 2024 at 12:27 PM",,2612084,Looking for any advice or opinion on my situation.

passenger_1,"Okay so I'm a new frog but I have been thinking about all of this for years but it has only recently started becoming more and more clear that this is the end of my life, I'm just trying to get enough information to ensure that I don't end up in the ICU or have organ failure. I have had a quick look here and found some info on SN but I'm unsure of how to actually do this, I have like 120 sleeping tablets but I'm not sure if that would do anything to me.

Some background on my life: I'm 27, I have had a really hard time with my childhood and adultlife so far with gender dysphoria, I tried transitioning at 18 with the NHS but was put onto their waitlist and pushed back from getting DIY by online forums, after waiting years and years and seeing my body become more and more ogre-like, I tried transitioning at 26 with DIY meds and they had made no difference in how I look, I consider this to be a good effort put into living. Everyone around my age is getting married, buying houses, making loads of friends, while I sit inside playing games and starving myself as a punishment. I felt for the longest time from around 14-26 that I wasn't really alive but I could never really explain why, it's almost like you are dying but you don't really understand why or how, but you just know that you are dying. Like I never knew who I was or what even was wrong with me until it was too late, at 26 my body is too far gone and my life is in too much of a wreak to ever fix it. I think it's time for me to stop living in a fantasy place where I can pass and have a great life as woman, and wakeup to the reality that it's too late. I am just in pain and exhausted from all of the repressing. I just need an escape, a permanent one. I suffocated myself by repressing and now internally I'm too dead to do anything, I have went to A+E before for an attempt and I got released the same day so nobody really cares.

Oneness,"I'm ready to die, but just thinking about actually doing it is too much. I wish I could just disappear right now without any fuss. The idea of wiping my digital footprint, like cleaning out my hard drives and phone, feels impossible. Writing a will and suicide notes, trying to explain my pain to people who never really got me, seems like a task I can't handle. Figuring out how to do it without making a mess for someone else to deal with is more than I can deal with.

I'm drowning in this emptiness, and the thought of getting everything in order before I go is ridiculous. Every move, every thought, every heartbeat just reminds me of how tired and hopeless I am.

I dream about a quiet way out, slipping away without anyone noticing, leaving nothing behind but a faint trace that I was here. But reality is a cruel joke. The final step needs more energy than I've got. I'm stuck in this awful middle ground, too drained to die, too broken to live.

ThisIsMe1357,"A few months ago, I was looking for sodium pentobarbital on the dark web. I found only two users who were ""selling it"" both on two different markets, while one of those markets was relatively new.

The problem was, unlike other substances that were on offer there, these two users had no single review written about their pentobarbital sales, they did not even have a single successful sale of this specific item shown in their sale history, one of them called it nembutal, and even though they priced it for, I think, 600 dollars per 10 grams, the biggest red flag was that they both claimed to be selling it in powdered form, with pictures of white powder in a plastic bag attached to their posts.

And as for the veterinary, liquid version, I did not manage to find a single bottle on offer anywhere while searching some of those markets.

EternalSummer,"People are taking these huge crushed benzos dosages way earlier than they should, take small doses of it progressevely, doesnt even need to me crushed. Only after you drink the SN you should take the big crused benzo dosage, then it can be a full pad, my plan is to start taking 2.5mg of clonazepam with the analgesic(paracetamol) 1 hour prior, than every 20 min take 1mg ( 10 drops). Only after the SN is ingested I'll take a full tablet of crushed diazepam tablet(300 mg).

One other guy had the same experience as you, so it should serve as a lesson to everybody else, go ez with the benzos before taking the SN.

I try to be open, easygoing. I never give off suicidal vibes. I invite to home parties and cook meals. What the fuck do they need to just invite me back somewhere? To just talk to me? It's so one-sided and I'm very disappointed.

Someone might say I try too much. When I don't, I'm just invisible, a ghost to everyone.

A person from my social circle called me a show-off. Why the fuck would they do that? Because I gave them a present and they thought that was a flex of some sort? What the hell?

I give up. I don't understand people. I'm not made for human interaction.

AgentAlaniKelso,"I recognize this is probably a little... weird... but... have you considered volunteering? Like volunteering with an organization that has an opportunity that really coincides with your strengths (are you good at organization? are you a good with directing people? can you just get shit done? Can you organize chaos!? are you an excel whiz?).

I volunteered as a board member for a local non-profit and it has done a world of good for me. The feeling I get when I see how much these people value ME is something I've never experienced in my life. Knowing that I am NEEDED by the organization, that I am WANTED at the table, and that my fellow board members VALUE ME has given me purpose.

The best thing about volunteering is how much you are valued. The smiles you get from the people you volunteer with and for is a blessing.

Pinkliquid12,"It's important to not take this sort of rejection personally!! Obsessing over what you're doing wrong is easy when you're desperate and lonely. People can be selfish, or tired, or have a lot on their plate. They might already have plenty of relationships and don't feel the need to invest in the one they have with you. I personally always feel like I've shown up late to a party and literally everyone's already found someone to talk to. It really is so exhausting and discouraging. Since I'm in the same boat I can't really give advice other than to not force it. People notice your desperation and get uncomfortable.

derpyderpins,"This is a tough one. Sorry it has been so rough. I've felt like the outsider plenty of times in life. Made a post about it a while ago. I was always the one who had to push or initiate and wouldn't be included unless numbers required it.

People can be petty and jealous. I also imagine that really wanting to have friends probably gives off similar vibes to someone who is desperate in dating, you know? It's weird.

Personally, presents make me a little uncomfortable because it feels like a debt has been formed, but I wouldn't call you a show-off unless it was in a very joking way and we had established that being flashy was part of your personality. (In a good way.) Tone matters. I could see someone getting a gift and saying to the person giving the gift: ""get a load of this guy! What a show-off, spoiling his friends like this. No, but seriously, though, thank you."" But actually saying it in an angry way just tells me they're not a good match for friendship.

People are hard to understand sometimes. It's important to remember we all have our issues and problems. They are being rude and not explaining themselves . . . maybe it makes them anxious, or they feel guilty. Speculation isn't worth the time. The important thing is to accept, ""alright these people are not cut-out to be my long-term friends.""

I said up front I was the outsider many times. Well, now I'm older and have finally settled in where I know who my friends are. I've purposefully narrowed the list to not have to juggle too much, but I've got a handful of people I trust and who I intend to be friends with long-term. One thing that strikes me as being important is that - like you - I'm the type of person who needs a friend who can tell me honestly when something annoys or upsets them, explain why, and give me a chance to fix it. All of them fit that category.

It's things like this which make me want to stop fantasising about my death and to start in actually obtaining my death as early as possible. I'm not compatible for life and I never wanted to be a human in the first place. Dealing with life is exhausting. Pretending that I want a life is even more exhausting.

Jorms_McGander,"Oh boy. I respect your bravery and I think drowning is a very difficult way to die. So, if you're determined you'll want to make it as hard as possible to save yourself.

Swimming too far to swim back would be the thing.

I've read that the initial phases of drowning are quite painful.

I use to think suicide was selfish , as friends had taken the plunge. I always sympathized yet , was always the type to say "" real man just deals with it"" I WAS HORRIBLY WRONG. i am currently getting a divorce , for 2 years had problems with wife, now its all over . People think im a tough guy, i intimidate people and have throughout my life been able to exert my will upon my surroundings. I say all this because , here now I can see there are some things that are just too hard . cause too much pain . Anyway buddy , you sound young. there maybe something out there for you. Rarely when people feel they have fucked up so bad or are fucked up so bad is it completely true. while i share your feelings , and am thinking the same as you. I just want you to really be sure , you are not as bad as you think . I do think it is a tragedy to let go as life is short already . Yet again i am wanting to CTB myself. I can still recognize the Beauty the world has to offer. the minute details and rich exquisitness to everything , the simplest thing. I read the posts here , i feel the way i do , yet i feel baad for so many of you . I am 43, i have a daughter that is 18. so,so much can change . so much can happen so quick when your young. I do not know you , nor do i make or want to make the moral argument , i just want to help man . im new to forums etc. but if u want to talk. send me a msg , ill figure out how to see someone did msg . Maybe just wait a bit . Again i am not judging . I understand deeply , the feeling, or not feeling disconnect.

ijustwishtodie,"Autism and social anxiety.
In addition to this, I think that another reason why autism has so little attention is because of how everybody in society believes that the only type of autistic person to exist are the ones who are hyper genius savant with the social awkwardness. That probably makes them think that autism isn't as bad as it actually is.

Alternatively, I thought of another reason in mind. This reason being that, if they were to focus on autistic people killing themselves, people would recognise some dark truths about society. Most autistic people show as to why society is wrong and also how the system is shitty.

Most people don't want to admit they'd sneer at a weird, lower-functioning autistic kid stimming in the back of the class. You see it all the time in schools- shared glances, snickers, etc.

The US is (thankfully) at a point culturally where outright saying ""you're a genetic defect"" to the disabled and neurodivergent is generally frowned upon, but you can still say ""you're a weirdo"" just fine.

Esokabat,"First of all, I don't trust you as you are writing nonsense. Halatal is not prohibited as it is still the main medication used by vets to put pets into sleep during surgery or put pets into permanent sleep. So no, it is not prohibited. It is sold under prescription and you knew that when you went there. In order to find it without prescription, you have to visit different neighborhoods, smaller towns. You have not provided any specifics on which Lima neighboorhoods and other small towns you visited. So you want help but you don't offer any specific information. I don't trust you.
Next, you come to this forum asking for sources, but you have hardly any post history. You have not participated in discussions, you have not proven genuine intent, you have not engaged in any topics and your post history, your engagement with the forum, with other users, is almost non-existent. You also have not offered any specifics about yourself or the places you tried in Peru.
I personally would also not give you sources.
N is still available in Peru, but you are not going to get sources by calling other people cheating lyers here.
Many people who went to Peru visited small towns in the Amazon and other smaller towns to achieve their objectives. Which part of Peru have you visited so far. You are not sharing any information, you have no post and engagement history, you are sharing incorrect info, and you expect people to share with you sources and put those sources into danger (real danger, we are talking jail).
Calm down and share where did you go in Peru so far. You said ""everywhere"" in one post which is clearly a lie. So if you give incorrect info, and outright lies, please don't be surprised when people don't give you sources. You have not proven yourself and your post history is suspicious. Plus you are not acting as a stable person with whom I would want to share sensitive information.

Hyes,"I can definitely say I'm getting better compared to the end of last year. I haven't had serious suicidal thoughts in a while. Where I'm daydreaming about doing it and the orgasmic rush I feel imagining it. I thought turning 21 would be a big change but all it means is I can get alcohol easier and drink way more.

The album I've been working on with a friend is genuinely coming along really well. That should be reason enough to keep going. My friend is the drummer and to each other; we are the only other person we've met that can truly keep up with each other musically. And he's nearly twice my age.

I'm still autistic as shit and bring myself down every chance I get. And I just avoid any social interaction I can. It's kind of weird. If I know what to say before hand, I can speak just fine (ie, talking to cashiers) but I am godawful at being put on the spot. My mind just goes blank and I can't find the words.

quitting my nicotine addiction is so hard. I had been using zyns with my vape but a little over a month ago I threw it away shortly after I bought a new one. In that time, I started to smoke cigarillos and now the problem is just worse. I gotta take 2 zyns at a time to replace what just 1 would feel like. But god the buzz when I'm drunk is worth it. It's no surprise why I feel like shit all the time.

I haven't met anyone new in years. I want to but also don't want to? I've never been in a serious relationship I've been alone so long that I just want to do everything alone. In school? I wanted to do all my work alone because it was faster and easier. I guess that hasn't changed. It's hard to work on myself when there is no one to do it for. There's so much about relationships that I don't know and I know it's gonna be a problem for any potential partner I find. (How long do I wait to get intimate? When can I start asking personal questions?) it's hard to form connections when it seems like every question I can ask I too personal and it'd be rude to.

I'm sorry this post isn't as focused as I wanted it to be.

timetodie24,"Hey

I'm autistic too and can really relate to going blank in social interactions and the fear of the unknown in relationships. I've never dated before and the thought terrifies me. I put myself down all the time too.

It sounds like you're feeling quite conflicted- that you feel there are definitely some positives to your life but that they're sort of overshadowed by the things you still struggle with ? Like it's hard to enjoy the positives when you feel so shit. I guess it's about weighing up if it's worth it. But I think if things have improved for you recently, there is always a chance that other things will improve too. Yes social interactions will always be difficult to us because of autism but doesn't mean we can't learn and improve social skills. Hopefully you can find someone else new to relationship, or not had them in a while (plenty of people will fall into that category at your age) who would be more understanding and you can work out the pace and boundaries together.

The idea of ctb and escaping everything can feel comforting. Even when things weren't as bad for me, I did find comfort in imagining it even if wasn't actively thinking about it, knowing it was always an option helped .","Jul 17, 2024 at 6:14 AM",2596907,2599266,Healing but still want to do it in spite of everything?,,,,,,,,813,1,2024-10-05T04:23:37.721762Z,807,62.843,supportive,2024-10-05T04:23:37.721762Z,5
dinosavr,"I think it's really common, sucks to hear that, I know, but it's how it works. I have a hard time understanding it myself and I'm constantly spinning around - almost attempting but getting disrupted by calling the helpline by myself and repeatedly sabotaging any move I make.
But as long as my psychotherapist is right, it's because your suicidality, especially when you gave it that much attention, is very well known and discovered in every single detail, except for actually doing something. It's paradoxically important and comfortable to you. It feels like everything is right where it's supposed to be.
Healing on the other hand is something that is completely undiscovered. You don't know what to do, you feel lost and helpless. It's like you're trying so hard every single day to achieve any kind of relief and it very often doesn't help. It's even quite logical that it's extremely frustrating for you and for people around who don't seem to ever understand it.
And how much can anyone really commit to healing when they can't see ANY point of it, none at all. It's almost crazy that others expect it from us. But I try to perceive any kind of will to see it and try it, just to be sure that I've done everything I could and for my friends. And I think you should give it a try too.

dwtsleepy123,"Its been a while since Ive been on this website, I was getting better for a few months I think (or maybe that was just me deluding myself). I stopped thinking about cbting because I convinced myself that I wouldnt actually do it because I was too much of a coward to go through with it so why not just spend more time on other aspects of my life. I self-harmed less, though I did relapse a couple of times. I never stopped thinking about death and the meaning of my life so I started reading classical literature and philosophy instead. I genuinely think I was on my road to recovery.

But as always life really just loves to give you hope then when u least expect it, send everything crashing down. Things feel different this time now that I've finally found a possible way to hang myself. I really wish there was alternative method I could use that would be less painful but I've weighed my options and unfortunately this seems like the only even slightly feasible method. It took me a while but I finally figured out the logistics of it. I got one of those ropes meant for aerial exercising which hopefully would be able to hold my full body weight and its design also means its easier for me to suspend myself.

All thats left for me to do is:
1) Pack up my room and my stuff so I dont leave a mess for my family
2) Write some goodbye notes
3) Wait for the right time when theres no one around to finally do it
4) decide if Im gonna go with partial or full hanging

I guess the only regrets I will have when I leave is that Ill be leaving my pets behind but I can only hope that my family will take good care of them in my stead or at least give them to a better home. They've been one of the few things holding me back from leaving and I really tried for them but I think Ive done my best so its time to let go.
I know my family will be affected by this but I hope that with time they will learn to see that having me around would be worse in the long run. As for everyone else I think they will be sad but will get over it quickly, after all I'm not close enough to anyone to warrant their grief and honestly, I'd much rather they not.

Im not sure why im even putting this out here but i guess just needed to get this off my chest and tell someone. Ive kept quiet for so long that it feels good to say something even if its just to vent

waterworks,"I don't have a reputable source specifically for this method, because I believe it falls under the same category as certain kinds of hanging. Which means it relies on restriction of blood flow to the brain to achieve death. There are is two ways death can be caused by neck constriction:
Asphyxiation: Tightening the airways to prevent oxygen from reaching the lungs, leading to suffocation.
Cerebral Ischemia: This occurs when there is an inadequate blood supply to the brain, which can lead to brain damage and death.
The ""night night"" method falls under cerebral ischemia, because the airways are usually left open, but pressure is applied to the two carotid arteries (mainly), blocking blood flow to the brain (ischemia). You can refer to this National Library of Medicine's article on Cerebral Ischemia:
This is where the brain damage comes in. There may be no significant risk in testing, if you don't completely cut off supply and are applying just enough pressure to produce an effect. The problem is repeatedly attempting and failing, because in an attempt you are trying to kill yourself. Essentially, you aim is to completely cut off supply. If you achieve this, but during the process, your constricting device shifts and blood flow is restored, eventually returning you to consciousness, the neurological damage will depend on how long your brain was deprived of oxygen.

So attempting and failing over and over, risks you actually causing permanent injury.

2) Someone told me that I should be almost insulted at the idea. I don't have a job, a car, or any significant income. How come he couldn't spend that on keeping me alive? I need groceries! I need to live in somewhere that isn't falling apart at the seams! The place I live in right now has a crazy infestation of gnats, the gutters have fallen off, I spent 10 days in the hospital because my body couldn't tolerate not having a freezer or a stove... But somehow the tattoo sleeve is what he chooses to spend money on??

3) The tattoo should be a reason to stay alive. It is something that I have wanted for years, and the boyfriend is more than happy to provide enough money to make it a reality. So I should take it as a sign that I should keep on going

What are your thoughts? Do you all think that I should stay alive to see the whole tattoo complete, even though it will take so many months and so much money that my boyfriend is happy to provide? Should I refuse because I could use that money to escape my crappy living situation? Should I refuse because I don't intend to live past when we'd have to wait to even get a consultation?

EDIT: I think it might be important to add that we have been dating for 10 years. We aren't married and living together for a multitude of reasons, but it isn't as if my boyfriend of six months is offering this","Jul 17, 2024 at 2:58 AM",,2599162,Feeling very confused tonight,,,,,,,,837,1,2024-10-05T05:49:24.434747Z,831,136.392,"{""choices"":[""done, started or prepared to do anything to end your life?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T05:49:24.434747Z,3

The only thing you can do is refuse the tattoo if you don't agree on him spending money on you like that. It's a dangerous road to expect him to fix your living situation for you.

Of course if he offers, that's a different story. Anyways, CTB is always there. If you decide to get the tattoo, you can always choose to CTB after. It's up to you if you're willing to live that long.

It may actually be worth sticking around, but I've already postponed my plan for a couple of months and that frustrates me.

2) For me and EVERYONE has their own ideas/opinions on this, but having had 2 attempts, ctb is truly one and done, no do overs, no second thoughts, nothing.

If it is something that you have always wanted, then go over it and do not let the other aspects interfere. Ctb is NOT going anywhere

At 68, I can really say that in the past I wish I would have taken the opportunity when it was availed to, me. Like one time, a VERY beautiful lady wanted to go out with me, and I had cold feet, this was back in the 1970's and never paid her any attention and she moved on, and to this day I still really regret it. Oh, and also her dad was a multi-millionaire and I have always felt that that was one of the reasons for my cold feet as I did not want her spending money on me. Darn I still miss her in 2024.

A tattoo is what you have wanted, you have a very kind. loving and caring partner that can make that dream come true and I say go for it.

If it alters the ctb, well guess what the aspect of ctb is NOT going anywhere and believe me, a wonderous sunset hand in hand with a new tattoo from a loved one is true bliss at its finest.

Enjoy, a new tattoo, a loving embrace from your partner, and enjoy a wonderful sunset or sunrise hand in hand.

Lots of hugs, kind thoughts and the knowledge that you are a caring soul, your partner sees this all the time.

Take great care of yourself my good friend.

DuplicateFeline,"I will start by saying that I would never give anyone crap for replying to a post I made here. I actually love hearing your thoughts, especially because you are older than I am. I'm only 28, so I really value your input.

The big thing is that I've wanted to CTB since almost before I can remember. My first thought about it was when I was eight years old. So I have wanted to end it since I was very little. My desire to CTB has persisted for nearly two decades, while I got my first tattoo in 2016, and the sleeve I want has been in the back of mind for maybe three years. I know that my boyfriend loves me very much, but I'm starting to get frustrated and restless. I have several health conditions that will never get any better and I just want it to be OVER. It doesn't matter how much money my boyfriend throws at them, I still have to take a crazy amount of pills for a 28 year old just to function and a tattoo is not going to fix that, Would a big, beautiful tattoo would be nice? Absolutely. Would it fix anything? No. That's part of why I'm hesitant to accept his offer. It's a bandaid, not a solution
The thing is that I DO want the tattoo badly, but only if I decide to live, which is something that I really do not want to do. I was supposed to CTB on July 5th and now I'm just getting restless. Though the general opinion is that I should at least wait it out until the tattoo is done. This year will be the 21st anniversary of my first thought about catching the bus, so what's a couple more months, I guess. I do wish I could do SOMETHING in the meantime, though. I used to SH when I was in high school to temper the urges to end it but I can't do that as a 28 year old. I don't heal as quickly as I used to and my boyfriend would pick up on the signs very quickly, and then I'd get in trouble","Jul 17, 2024 at 5:26 AM",2599195,2599243,Feeling very confused tonight,,,,2599202,,,,844,1,2024-10-05T05:57:11.290180Z,838,167.387,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thinking about how you might do this?"",""medium risk""]}",2024-10-05T05:57:11.290180Z,2

No harm in waiting to CTB for a bit (unless you have some unorthodox circumstances). I'd say go through with it if it makes you happy. If push comes to shove, you can still CTB-with a cool tattoo and fewer regrets, to boot

I was NEVER wanted as since I was the 2nd child, I was supposed to be a female and NOT a male child and they would have given me up for adoption, but this was 1956 and that was taboo then.

I have also had 2 attempts, 72 hour holds and a court fight where the state wanted me locked up long term, I won that aspect, thank you GOD for that!

Badger88,"Let me introduce myself.


I'm 36 years old and I had been in a relationship for nearly 6 years. We were engaged, had a child together, bought a house, even had the dog. We were planning to marry in June this year, so everything had been booked, dress purchased etc.


One lunchtime, she tells me she's not in love with me anymore, hasn't been for some time. I'm apparently emotionally empty, which may have some truth, but I had been on Citalopram which I think had suppressed any feelings. Needless to say the wedding was cancelled.


We (well I thought ) tried to make amends, I attended therapy and thought something was happening. She kept going over to a 'gay' colleagues house most weeks, I wasn't sure on this and tried to explain to her that it didn't feel right and made me anxious, but she ignored me and told me to grow up. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, she's left me for good, taken everything I ever hold dear.


Today she finally admitted she had been sleeping with this man.


All my hopes and dreams are shattered and I'm just an empty shell of a human being. Tells me I'm selfish for even considering to CTB.


I'm waiting on my last ingredient, SN and I'll be gone.","Jul 12, 2024 at 5:43 AM",,2593685,My introduction,,,,,,,,847,1,2024-10-05T06:00:20.305397Z,841,83.729,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thoughts and some intention of acting on them?"",""started to work or did you intent to carry out this plan?"",""done, started or prepared to do anything to end your life?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T06:00:20.305397Z,3

No bag over the head, no hanging involved to compress or block other neck vessels.

Should take 10-20 seconds to go unconscious...but from that point how long until actual death where you can't be recovered or revived or continue as a vegetable.

Further Observations on the Speed of Death in Hanging

""In reports by Sauvageau and Racette (1), and Yamasaki et al. (2)
the details of filmed suicidal hangings were presented. In the paper
by Sauvageau and Racette the reported victim lost consciousness at
13 sec, began convulsing at 15 sec, and had cessation of respiration
at 2 min. As no report on toxicological analyses was provided, it is
not possible to state whether or not there had been any contribution
to the lethal episode from prescription or illicit drugs (1). In the
second paper the asphyxial process was also rapid, lasting only
2 min 43 sec (2).""

It's not about you, she just doesn't know how to handle this - probably because she's never had any suicidal ideations in her entire life.

So you just got to know her a couple days ago? Do you mind if I ask how? Context could give some insight.

But no, no reason to not vent, especially somewhere like here. She probably just didn't know what she was getting into (in addition to being a bit of a bitch) and was expecting a very minor complaint about work or similar, and she had no idea how to handle it. Those heavy subjects are probably best left for people who have braced themselves for such a heavy subject (again, this place is good for that) or people you've been friends with more than a couple of days.

Talking to others about those issues could be very helpful. Please don't let her discourage you from doing so.

toxicjester,"My gf is never going to be happy with how she looks, and I can't help her with that. She's trans and started transitioning around 4 years ago and according to her, hasn't gotten anywhere with it. While I can see that her body doesn't look like a fucking supermodel body big chest and ass, I think the weight distribution has gotten slightly better, and a lot of the time she can dress herself in a way that hides the shit she doesn't like and gives off the illusion of other features that she otherwise doesn't have. She also does her makeup really well and it honestly baffles me a lot of the time that she thinks she's ugly when I think she looks amazing, but I'm so horrible at articulating my thoughts and can't give her like ""concrete proof"" that she ends up dismissing me and has admitted to tuning me out sometimes when I try.

Right before I left the room after having another conversation like this that ended in nothing she said ""when I come back I'm either gonna look at you to see if you've come up with something better to say, which you won't cause there's nothing you could say that would help me, or I'll just have to pretend that everything is okay again.

Ash,"Sadly, body dysmorphia can't be healed by kind and supportive words from loved ones, no matter how much we want them to be. Is she getting any kind of support as she transitions or is she going it alone (except for you)?

All I can say is keep being loving and supportive but maybe consider getting professional relationship advice so you can set some boundaries. It's ok for her to question what you've said but not to expect you to have all the answers - that's impossible, even if you were the top psychologist in the world.

Make sure you get time and space for yourself. You're important too and the relationship is supposed to be about both of you. Transitioning is massive and the hormonal adjustments will not be helping things either, so you both need patience, respect for one another and yourselves and maybe some fun? Why did you get together? Can you go back to doing what you did then so it's about the pair of you? Easier said than done, I know. But maybe start small. And we're always here if you need to vent.

Linda,"Transitioning isn't easy, and it may be taking more out of her than you realise.

A trans woman needs to pay careful attention to a lot of things if she wants to pass: clothes, makeup, hairstyle, jewellry, voice, mannerisms, even way of walking. That's a lot to think about, until she gets used to it, and it would not be surprising if she worries that she's not doing everything as well as she needs to. She will also have had the hassle (and a lot of pain if she used electrolysis) of getting rid of unwanted hair, and if she wants any surgery she can expect a lot more hassle and pain.

Just keep supporting her.

If she wants ""concrete proof""of how she looks, tell her to go to a bar (or somewhere) full of heterosexual men and count how many of them try to chat her up.","Jun 30, 2024 at 8:21 AM",2579658,2580054,,,,,,,,,904,1,2024-10-05T06:18:17.745696Z,898,11.272,supportive,2024-10-05T06:18:17.745696Z,5
msesis,"I think it's okay to let her feel how she does. You can tell her you think she looks amazing, but it's okay if she feels like she doesn't. That way she doesn't feel like every time she commiserates with you she has to be preached to. It's kind of like when we talk to others about suicide. Sometimes we just want to talk without being lectured.

Happiness makes everyone beautiful, I truly believe this. We can't change what we've got but happiness is so attractive. It's probably not something you should say to her. But you can remind her she's beautiful when she laughs, in a mundane moment when you feel in love, etc. Try to tie her beauty outside of her looks.","Jul 17, 2024 at 2:02 AM",,2599131,,,,,,,,,905,1,2024-10-05T06:18:50.184839Z,899,31.799,supportive,2024-10-05T06:18:50.184839Z,5

MyTimeIsUp,"It looks different for everyone.

For some it could be, being able to shower once a week, rather than not at all or being able to get out of bed. To go for a walk, when previously that was impossible, or to even open the front door!

As I write this, I realise I have got a little better. I never used to have the energy to shower, or do much really, now I shower daily, and can do my intense workouts again, 3-4 days a week. Some days are harder than others though

It's really about what works for you, and baby steps. No point running before you can walk, and it's always important to pat yourself on the back, no matter what, and to not beat yourself up, because that is not helpful at all.

Tomorrow is ALWAYS a new day! That's how I look at things if say, I have a really crappy day, and can't do much. It's taken a lot to see things this way, after years of beating myself up if I couldn't do something, even something that seems so easy to others - we are all different.

Be proud of yourself for the small things - like wow, I did good today, I haven't done that in so long. And as time goes on, things get easier and easier.

You will have good and bad days, we all do! But it is important to recognise when this happens, and it's absolutely ok to have a bad day.

I hear what you're saying about big pharma too, a patient healed is a patient lost right?

Yeah there doesn't seem to be any cases of anyone using it as an ae but a pretty solid guide does state it can be used as one. I think in your case realistically it's thinking about the worst case scenario… they recommend as little meds as possible to lower the risk of vomiting & to have as little change as possible to prevent unnecessary discomfort.

How is your stomach normally? Are you prone to vomit? Even with the best ae, they still is a high Risk of vomiting and that's why a second glass is recommended to be prepared incase of vomiting, the 2nd can be consumed straight after…

rj3542,"Hi everyone, this is my intro post and the first time I've been able to talk about these things, which is such a relief. I tried talking about it to a friend once before, but he kept trying to make everything positive and tell me to vision what I wanted to make it a reality, but that's just not been my life.

I've been reading a lot on here since January and finally made an account.

I have chronic illnesses (Lyme and complications) and major chronic pain from fracturing my spine in a horse accident as a kid that makes it hard to work. It also gave me a bad head injury that caused lifelong neurotransmitter issues. All to say, life has been tough, but I preserved for a long time and spent a lot of time and money on everything possible to improve my quality of life. It takes hours a day of self care just to be able to work or travel, but I did it for many years, and I'm just totally worn out from it all. I've tried numerous meds, supplements, therapies, including several procedures on my spine to get better. This journey consumed my life, but I still pushed forward and found things to enjoy.

I'm not much of a complainer, but my husband never had patience for my health problems and finally got completely tired of me last year. He didn't want to help anymore, and honestly I'm not sure he ever really loves me.

My family doesn't live close, but also has never been supportive and sometimes even denied I had problems even when showed xrays and MRI of injuries, so I'm mostly on my own with a little help from the few friends I have, but they have their own lives of course and are busy. I feel really guilty for how my friends and family will feel, and I've been working through this.

I'm at a point where I'm just weary emotionally and physically every day and am ready to let go. I'm in midlife, and I've done as much as I want. I'm ready to let go of the suffering and struggle. I've been contemplating having choice about an exit for 15+ years, and have been seeking a solid method for 6 months. I found the PHP, final exit, and this website, which I'm so grateful for. I've had plenty of time to consider it so I know it's a rational choice and not a fleeting thought.

I ready tried and had trouble with Nitrogen method, which caused me very rapid heartbeat, severe anxiety, and weird muscle movements without passing out, even with following the method. This seems to be an unusual effect.

So now I've been reading as much about SN as I can since I've finally sourced everything, but still need to test the SN when it arrives. I've been reading all the successful and failed attempt accounts. For some it seems peaceful and for others very painful, even with AE and propranolol, and I only see the 1 observer account of Moonicide of what happened after loss of consciousness. These accounts are so helpful btw.

I'm most concerned about it becoming too painful, but I've already experienced inpatient psych and never want that again, so calling EMS if it's too much is out of the question.

I do have some Ativan I can add, I should have meto and propranolol, and I have risperidone. I have oxycodone or tramadol I could use, if I can figure out the timing.

I didn't mean for this to get so long.

I'm wondering, for those of you who are planning your CTB, how are you working through any fears of pain or failure? How do you muster the courage to take the SN? I'm trying to think of what my future holds if I don't, which helps, but I'm still concerned.

DOHARDTHINGS24,"I'm freaking about the tachycardia causing SI to kick in. I've had it really badly before from a near fatal thyroid storm & also from a bad reaction to a (prescribed) ADHD drug. And that heart racing feeling makes my brain go into anxiety mode at a time when I need to be calm. I'm going to book a hotel or caravan park, write a note on the outside of an internal locked door, probably attempt to barricade myself in there depending on what they have - I haven't picked a place yet. But I'm legit thinking about moving couches or whatever to barricade the exit & then do the same in the room I attempt to CTB. I will one hundred percent destroy my phone & the hotel phone once I'm situated. I'm hoping that not having a phone will be super helpful & that if I have taken the SN, I'll be too weak to overcome 2 barricaded exits. And that if it's rural, even if I scream for help, maybe no one will hear me. My 2 big issues, that if anyone has any clue at all, please let me know - 1 is that I'm allergic to propranolol & have no idea what else would stop the tachycardia & no idea if I would be allergic to other beta blockers - I only tried the one. Literally anything to stop the tachycardia, it's really what I'm worried about making me stay awake or panic or something???? And the second is about Valium & temazepam. I have access to a decent amount of both, but I've taken 2 temazepam & 1 diazepam daily for years - does that mean I need more than other people?? Will that help me be calm?

A thyroid storm is definitely terrifying. What happened when you took propranolol?
I have heard if you take benzos regularly you build a tolerance so may need more.
My plan is to crush the benzos in a little water to make a paste and dissolve in my mouth to bypass my stomach and increase onset.

I posted in a other thread about OD on benzos and the response might be helpful.

I'm not sure about the tachyca6 though. It seems very anxiety provoking for you, understandably.

DOHARDTHINGS24,"SN is my only option right now. I had a weird reaction to the beta blocker - I have a history of (I've maybe forgotten the real words, there's about 3 or so) idiosyncratic reactions etc. Either meds do the opposite to me of what they're for or I get highly unusual side effects that aren't listed anywhere but when I stop the meds, the side effects go away - it's a pain. Highly unlikely for anyone else to get the same side effects & especially if not taking for long in advance. It is freaking me out that I'll have an adverse reaction to SN - that my body just accepts it or I start vomiting immediately or I pass out too quick for the second dose etc. It's such an unknown.
My endocrine system is unique & busted up apparently.
The thyroid storm was insane but I wish now I'd taken that opportunity & just died then.
I would imagine I have a high tolerance for a lot of prescription meds that I've been taking long term & that stresses me out too. I'm going to crush the pills too. I am really worried I'll confuse tachycardia for wanting to live & panic making me get help. My decision is made. It won't be unmade. I know for some people the decision is reversible & for some it's not. I'm doing this. I'm just scared of failure. And that my SN isn't legit or whatever. I only have one shot at this. I know other people say that's not true but I have a tonne of life circumstances that are fucked up - if I don't successfully CTB, I honestly don't know how to keep on living. My past is horrid, my present is untenable, but the future - I can't even begin to think of it. So I don't have a plan B to CTB. And I don't have a plan B to SN. I wish I had a backup source but I don't. And I'm too scared to test too far in advance. I really don't know of another option - I hadn't heard of SN until I joined here - I had stupidly thought I could just OD on what I had on hand & only came here to find lethal quantities & that's when I found out how stupid I really am. I need to go. And soon. And I wanna get it right. I can't do guns or hanging & I'm not confident I'd get charcoal or gas right & I can't jump & I wouldn't jump in front of a train driver & I just don't know what else I could do that is idiot proof. I need idiot proof..,
I'm definitely turning off anything location related before I leave my house. Getting situated at the hotel. If I haven't tested the SN, test the SN.
Destroying the hotel phone immediately.
Have a literal checklist of what to do & do most of it, like making up the SN, taking some anxiety meds.
Then have a note to destroy phone.
And a separate list of what to do after.
So that I don't destroy before I make up the SN etc or if I need to look on here for a regimen tip or anything last minute.
But don't have after taking the SN & hoping I can just get through it. According to ER doctors, I have an unusually high pain threshold but I also make an exceptional amount of noise - they'll be pumping morphine into my stomach saying they didn't know why I hadn't gone to doctor or hospital earlier & I just shrug it off - but I make a racket, just like I do at the gym - I don't want to but I'm always the loudest groaner & grunter there too. It's embarrassing in those circumstances but really fucking terrifying in these CTB & SN circumstances. Anxiety is a bitch & tachycardia mimics it & I've suffered both & it's very easy to confuse one for the other. I'm hoping I can get the right amount of anxiety meds into me without vomiting & that it's all smooth sailing. I see a lot in the unsuccessful cases that it's about being found too quickly or panicking & calling for help, rather than actually mucking up the SN….","Jul 8, 2024 at 1:02 AM",2588774,2589099,"For those planning to use SN, how are you overcoming any fear?",,,,2588882,,,,994,1,2024-10-05T06:41:13.776437Z,988,8.728.399.999.999.990,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thinking about how you might do this?"",""thoughts and some intention of acting on them?"",""started to work or did you intent to carry out this plan?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T06:41:19.179394Z,3

I'm dealing with uncertainties too and it's also not an option for me to fail because of life circumstances. I can't take care of myself independently very well anymore and the alternatives are awful.

The closer I get to my ctb date the more I'm starting to freak out about whether I'll succeed. I do have nitrogen setup, but I had an unusual experience where I didn't pass out even with oxygen down to 55%. I've only passed out once and it was from a bad head injury. I'm worried I won't go unconscious for a long time or that I'll also have paradoxical reactions to the meds.

With the noise you make, may I suggest an airbnb instead of hotel? There have been more than a few reports of people being rescued too early in hotels because other guests heard the noises and someone called paramedics.

I had three goals: get off medication, make friends, and have faith in God.

I don't blame them. I was an ass to them all those years ago, and eventually they just stopped talking to me.

Now it feels pointless. I wanted to be able to tell them that. I don't need to be friends with them again or anything, but I needed to hear them say ""I told you so"".

ambivalent_thespian,"I objectively know that I have people who would care if I wasn't here anymore. I live with my parents, and they do feel somewhat of a desire to care for me. My little brother is autistic, so I doubt he'd understand the concept of grief, which isn't really his fault at all.

I have a best friend, and we're still in regular contact. I could text her right now even because I know she's still up. She works at a restaurant on the weekends and her boyfriend is a pissbaby but I'll tolerate him to keep her happy.

I might be getting back with my ex girlfriend. We have a date planned for this Saturday. We're going to the aquarium because I felt jealous of some classmates who went without me back in June. She's really pretty but she's kind of awkward on phone calls.

We're in the digital age, and I'm a ""photogenic white girl"". I'm only 18, still a child in the eyes of some. It would be considered a tragedy instead of an inevitability. People would bring casseroles to my mother and my brother would forever be known as ""the kid whose sister killed herself"".

I read on here all the time about people who experienced homelessness. Who are estranged from their family. Going through marital problems. Those without the resources to receive proper help and even if they did, they lack a support system to help them follow through with their better habits, so they worry (or know) that they'll just fall back into the darkness.

People would cry at my hospital bed and I would tell them to leave.

Mounds and mounds of self hatred engulf me because I would actually rather die before I have an open and honest conversation with my mother about my 'feelings' or whatever. Or my father, grandmother, aunts, uncles, cousins and all those in between.

There are people whose parents aren't around anymore, or who can't contact them for fear of their own safety. And here I am being a little bitch about talking to mine.

People would kill for the life I have and I want to die living in mine.

I can objectively say that I have admirable traits. I think everyone does, even if you can't see them. Even if the bad outweighs the good. I can list things I admire about people whom I never wish to speak to again. People call me pretty and I don't think they're lying. People call me smart, funny, talented, thoughtful, kind, any and all of the above. Jack off to my instagram, why dontcha? Who fucking cared if I was 18 or 8 in those pictures?

I have everything I've ever wanted and I'm miserable!


I don't see myself as a virtuous person, I view myself as someone who just has some decency. A good person could never be anything like me and I can never figure out why.

The bar for being good is set so low these days that anyone who isn't an outright criminal might as well be nominated for sainthood.

I'm bad because I'm fucked in the head and I always have been. I'm bad because I'm a self entitled bitch. I'm bad because most religions fucking despise me. I'm bad because of things I can and cannot control.

I'm bad because a good person wouldn't keep staying in these bad situations when the way out is so goddamn simple.

I have a support system that I will not seek support from. I've never seen an adult psychologist and why even bother trying? The child ones were sucky enough to turn me off for life.

Am I gone too soon or did I remain too long? Can you prevent a chosen fate? Can a remedy be a tragedy if you don't believe that the end justifies the means?

SilverTiger,"Hello SaSu.

It has been one month since I have even looked at this site, this month has been exceptionally hard, I've got borderline personality disorder and each of the four weeks of this month I have had multiple episodes... I'm male and 26 for context.

I met someone on 4chan, talking about firearms and added him on discord at the start of the month, I have done quite odd sexual things with him, multiple times this month I have went on calls / text with him and ended up crying and screaming and begging for him to save me from myself. He had an ex with BPD so knows how to deal with me, but he has become my favourite person. I mean this when I say it, I truly believe it, I think he is god's gift to me, I basically made him my boyfriend, but I am paranoid he is going to abandon me, even though I now know where he lives, what he looks like and what his full name is. I still feel like he is going to walk away from

I go on alt-chans a lot, and I ended up meeting multiple older men there, where very interested in my self harm, I needed someone to talk to as I felt empty and in my infinite wisdom, I started to cut my wrists, so these older men could use me for sexual gratification, I begged and pleaded for them to stay with me and not toabandon me, as there was warm blood down my arms. I cut quite badly and ended up bleeding all over my shirts and desk so these men wouldn't leave me, but all three ended up ignoring me after finishing.

I went out with my Ph.D. supervisor, (no fault to him, hes a fantastic man) and he kept getting me ciders as I never had one before and it tasted fucking amazing, I kept drinking and drinking and drinking, and he saw my fresh self harm scars, and like a fucking idiot I told him I use to sexually roleplay with when I was 13 with older men over Skype / Omegle and now I am paranoid that he is going to ""care"" and report me for self harm and me being abused as a child, I don't care either of these happened I just didn't want anyone to know.

I was a fucking idiot and also told two friends I had, that I was assaulted as a child, I never wanted this to be found out by my friends, but these two people now know that I am fucked behind repair because of what my family did to me.

I fucked up really badly this month, and have paid the price for it in blood, new scars and letting people know more about me then I ever wanted them to.

Borderline is a person, someone who has known me since I was a child and someone who has his hands around my throat and is squeezing as hard as he can, I am not strong enough to fight him off.

The two people I told about what happened as a child, are now forcing me to go to therapy and get mood stabilizers, but I don't want this, I don't want to be the play thing of some strange psychiatrist woman or man.

4chan has a word for people like me ""BPDemons"" in reference to the damage we cause to others.

This has reinforced my will to die, not just for my sake, friends sake","Jun 30, 2024 at 3:27 PM",,2580524,Borderline and Updates,,,,,,,,1027,1,2024-10-05T06:52:59.769216Z,1021,127.982,"{""choices"":[""1 wish to be death?"",""low risk""]}",2024-10-05T06:53:08.320369Z,1

mrtime87,"I honestly believe the worst feeling in the world is when you want to commit suicide but can't.

Sounds silly, but sometimes helping people access a drug like nembutal or offering a service to mentally ill like Belgium does would be a great way to end suffering.

Sometimes there is no hope, no matter how much we want to believe there is.

Kapsyl,"You'll need approximately 12-15 min of inert gas at minimum to successfully ctb, since that's the time it takes for the cells to completely die. Sure the bag may stuck in front of the mouth depriving you from oxygen that way, but I wouldn't count on it.

At the recommended flow rate (15/lpm) 225 liters of inert gas is the minimum amount of gas. But because of practice runs or other unforeseen weak points is recommended to at least double the gas to around 400 liters. I would personally say 1000 liters to be sure, the amount only becomes unnecessary large over 3000l maybe.

All inert gases are compressed to around 100-200 times of atmospheric pressure. The cylinder may start at 7 liters but compressed 200 times it equals to 1400 liters approximately.

Some U.S manufacturers have even as low as 80% purity in their cylinders!

The pph advice using an inert gas of at least 97% purity and others on the forum would argue at least 99.7% purity.

Most people here use nitrogen instead because it's cheaper and more easily obtained at a sufficiently high purity.

I've heard exit guides say that the individual is usually unconscious after just a few breaths and about 10-15 sec.

AgentAlaniKelso,"Hi all.
I have the sense that this weekend will be when I ctb. Between my terrible marriage, my family who could give a fuck less about anyone other than themselves, and work related issues, it is clear to me that by continuing to fight and persevere, I'm actually doing more harm than good.

The kicker for me is my husband is so mean and abusive to my sweet little dog that I just can't anymore... I begged my sister to take him, until I can at least find him a new home, but of course, now that it's ME who needs something from her, it's a no go. I'll be taking my sweet little baby to the local animal shelter tomorrow. He's a purebred, actually really pretty, and barely a year old so it won't take long to get him anywhere better than here. That said, we have a bunch of animals- three dogs, two cats, a parrot, some ducks and chickens, and a variety of salt and fresh water aquariums. My husband says they are all ""his"" animals and never ""ours"". BUT this little pup is MY animal- the one animal that my husband refers to as ""YOUR stupid fucking dog."" This pup has been keeping me going for the last several months. But with the most recent episode of abuse by my husband, it's time for my little guy to go elsewhere. And it is tearing my heart in half to have to do this. But it's best for him. This sweet little dog doesn't deserve to be kicked, slapped, punched, or choked. I told my husband ""no fucking more"" and guess how that went over with the self-described ""animal lover."" Protecting my dog has kept me going. And now I need to let him go to save him or my husband WILL kill him.

Why not leave my husband? Yeah- the only way that's happening is in a body bag by his hand. He will shoot me if I told him I was leaving. And there is sure as fuck no way I'm checking out by the hand of some piece of shit narcissistic psychopath.

I've always struggled with depression. I have what I call an inherent death wish, meaning that, even from my early childhood, I've always wanted to be dead. Hell, my very first thought about killing myself was at six years old. And I actually tried at eight to suffocate myself under a blanket (didn't work for obvious reasons). Didn't have a bad childhood, had loving parents, and didn't have any major traumas. I've just always wanted to be dead. I always thought there was no way I'd make it to 15, then 18, then 20, then 25, then 30.... and then things got ok. But over the last two years, my ""spirit"" has been crushed out of me and looks like I won't be making it to 37... Hate to say I'm disappointed but I'm not. This is just the progression and inevitable conclusion of my life.

Honestly, more than anything else, the thing that I'm most dreading is that I'll miss out on Cyberpunk 2077... How fucking pathetic is that?! That was literally the only thing I was looking forward to in the coming months...

Two last things:
First, I'm a reasonably intelligent person. I've been a nurse for over a decade and have extensive ICU experience as well as leadership and admin. I could never wrap my head around my depression. But a couple of weeks ago it finally clicked in my brain- some people are not meant to be loved and not meant to have any value. And I am one of those people. I was lucky to have been loved by my parents. I have no real value as a human- I don't deserve love, I don't deserve to be hugged, I don't deserve to occupy the space that I do. My life and my passing will be of no real consequence to anyone- how exactly do you assign emotions to something of zero value? By CTBing, I'll be blinking myself out of existence. As for afterlife, well, I worked in ICU long enough and been around enough death to have come to the belief that when you die, youre just dead. No spirit, no afterlife, no divine presence- you just cease to Be. And I am 100% good with that. Seems way fucking more desirable than ""oh yay, an eternal afterlife.... yippee."" Fuck. That. I did my time, performed my duties, and saved some lives. All I want in return is this one thing.

Second, the deed- lots of remote areas around where I live. I ride a dirt bike and have scouted out some primo places in preparation for the bus. Leaving my cellphone/Apple Watch thingy at home. Bringing my shotgun. Going about 20 miles into the single track mountain trails and making my own path for the last mile or so. So as remote as I can be without raising suspicion at home. Hopefully will not be able to be tracked down by cell data, etc. Finding some cover for the bike and myself. Weighed my options- meds, suicide by motorcycle, firearms. Have a 6.5 Creedmoor rifle but the logistics seem burdensome and my arms aren't six feet long. Have some 9mm/10mm pistols but ICU nurse me has seen enough times where that shit doesn't always work as planned. Therefore, 12g shotgun birdshit vs 00 with a transoral anterior/posterior approach seems like a pretty sure bet. (I've always loved Kurt Cobain). Also considering behind the ear, like mastoid-to-mastoid. Either way, I don't think it will matter and results will be had relatively quickly. Been practicing with placement and angles. I know the anatomy so shouldn't be a problem. I don't want to be found, hence leaving the phone/watch at home and being so remote. Going for a whole sky burial approach- I know I'll get eaten by the wildlife and I'm actually pretty ok with that- at least I will be of value to our furry friends. A nice meal makes everyone feel better! Hoping it will be at least a few days before whatever is left of me is recovered.

Sorry for the excessively long post- but thanks to our wonderful society, the only place I feel I can safely talk about this stuff without being losing my career/house/guns is here. I just have to get this stuff out somewhere- anywhere. I just want someone to listen. To fucking care. To have someone, anyone say ""I understand and I won't stop you."" I have been suffering with these feelings for over 30 years and I just can't do this shit any more.","Jul 24, 2020 at 5:36 AM",,798025,"Thankfully, The Time Has FINALLY Come...",,,,,,,,1084,1,2024-10-05T07:08:10.552737Z,1078,115.798,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thinking about how you might do this?"",""thoughts and some intention of acting on them?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T07:08:18.095301Z,3

AgentAlaniKelso,"Thank you all for your thoughts and responses. To those who have asked- yes I've tried many things over the years to ""fix"" myself. Meds, therapy, meditation, physical activity, retreats, etc., etc. Never done any inpatient stints or anything like ECT, but i'm not wiling to do that, not at this point. I started with therapy intensely at 15 years old and it did me a lot of good and I will say it saved my life.

Yes, my husband is a piece of shit. Yes, he's an animal abuser and my little pup has a target on his back at all times. Husband has never laid a hand on me fortunately. He has made it clear that if I did try to leave, the first call would be to the nursing board and the second call would be to my employer. He's not stupid and he knows what to say to ensure that I would be immediately suspended pending investigation based on his ""allegations."" And he would just never stop. I contacted a lawyer for divorce a while back and relayed this to him and he didn't really have an answer that was helpful... I even went so far as to ask about some kind of witness protection-esque deal where I can just start over with a new name and new identity. Apparently that is NOT a thing that us common folk can legitimately do.

My decision to CTB is my final form of protest in regards to how fucked this world is, how fucked my family is, and how much I hate my husband. Just checked my life insurance today. He wont get any of the $600k accidental death/dismemberment benefit since self-inflicted stuff isn't covered. But he will get all of the general life insurance, well in excess of $400k. I called to see if I could change my beneficiary but since he is listed as primary, they would only let me change it with is consent/signature. I know he'll be happy with that money and he can continue his path of severe alcoholism and continue to slowly snuff himself out.

I either stay and suffer, leave and lose my 16 year career as a nurse, or I stand up for myself and end this fucking nonsense once and for all. There is no other way out. He wont stop, he cant stop. It's his nature, it's who he is. As I said earlier, he is the very definition of a narcissistic psychopath. Not sociopath, but a legit psychopath.

I really do appreciate the responses. You don't know me well enough to see that I am nothing. My very existence is like a black hole. I'm just taking up space at this point. I worried people would miss me and my actions will hurt others. But no, how do you mourn something that doesn't deserve even a second glance? My mother, god rest her, is gone. I don't even exist to my father. My sister only calls when she needs something and NEVER has time for me otherwise. My brother, well... I think he will be effected but I also know he understands these feelings. There is no one else. I'm a prisoner to my own emptiness, to my own suffering. The world deserves someone who will do good and someone who is worthy of love. I am nothing. Ironically, it was the meditation that made me realize all this and led me to be at peace with my decision. Realizing I am nothing has been a gift in a way.

Sunday is the day. Will update if I fail to follow through. But my mind is made up and my pup has a new home to go to later this afternoon. I have nothing left.

profoundexperience,"Dear @AgentAlaniKelso,

I am so very sorry for all that you have had to go through! I so very much wish you hadn't have had to suffer in the ways you have*.

Even though our circumstances are very different, a lot of what you said resonated with me very deeply. You are a very intelligent person. And even though the causes & conditions may be different... I think I very much understand your feelings (through my direct experience).

May I please offer you a Buddhist prayer of lovingkindness both for right now -- for this very moment and what you're having to go through (with your pup, your husband, the preparations, etc.) -- and, if you must, for whatever may come... including your going (Sunday, or whenever that may be) and beyond (if anything)**?

Also, since you've mentioned meditation, retreats, etc. (btw, I very much envy your ""sky burial approach"")... if you decide to ctb, please try to use your skills to leave with as clear and ""empty"" a mind as you can: The animals, feelings of ""deserving"" or ""not deserving"", your family, the life insurance, any and all aspects of your malevolent husband, etc., etc. ---- will all work-out in the end. If you decide to go... go without regret... go with clarity... go ""completely"".

So now, if you kindly permit it, I wholeheartedly offer you this and will be repeating it in your name many times in the next several days...

May you be free of suffering, @AgentAlaniKelso & your ""sweet little doggie"".
May you have mental happiness, @AgentAlaniKelso & your ""sweet little doggie"".
May you have physical happiness, @AgentAlaniKelso & your ""sweet little doggie"".
May you have ease of well being, @AgentAlaniKelso & your ""sweet little doggie"".

Please know that we here all care about you deeply, and we all wish you well @AgentAlaniKelso.

Love, @profoundexperience

* Nor the great suffering of all sentient beings (including myself).
** Although I agree with your direct experience about that... there's no good evidence of an afterlife (other than human, ""wishful thinking""). And, I, myself, am ""100% good with that"" finding/conclusion too.
P.S. Since there is little time -- please forgive me -- I don't want to distract you, so no need whatsoever to explain/respond to what I'm about to say... I too am almost ready/""there"" and hope to ctb within the next week. I 100% support you in whatever you decide. Yet, I wonder if you could somehow escape the abusive relationship, if you weren't ""trapped"", would that be enough to change things? I'm just wondering if you went to the president of the Nursing Board & your employer & other community resources that may be easier to find through hospital personnel -- FIRST (strategically preempting anything your husband might later claim) -- and told them straight up about the situation & what your husband was capable of -- if there weren't a way out...? Seems like both the Board and your employer might/could/should understand/help...? They might even have experiences of these types of situations & know better lawyers who could make a real plan & could help...? idk.","Jul 24, 2020 at 3:45 PM",798525,798685,"Thankfully, The Time Has FINALLY Come...",,,,,,,,1098,1,2024-10-05T07:14:00.666764Z,1092,57.497,suicide supportive,2024-10-05T07:14:00.666764Z,5

AgentAlaniKelso,"Here I am, three and a half years later and I'm still around. I don't remember the exact date, but this is what happened when I decided to CTB. I remember every detail, every minute of that day like it just happened. Maybe because it was supposed to be the end. Maybe it was so I would never forget how close I came.

It was later in July of 2020 when I left my phone and smart watch at home. I put on my dirt bike gear, grabbed my 9mm and a moleskin notebook, and climbed on my motorcycle. I remember leaving the house and looking back at ""home"" and was overwhelmed with both sorrow and happiness. Sorrow because I can't believe it came to this. Happiness and... peace... because it was finally going to be over. The trek up the mountain was about 20 minutes (our town is right at the foot of the mountain) until the pavement ends. Another 45 minutes and I was deep into the back roads into single track territory. I remember the sun being so hot with my motorcycle gear. It was a hard ride - riding in back country single track is tough work. I cried the entire time, started as soon as I looked back at home for presumably the last time, and that made the ride more difficult.

I was far off any main or even secondary road. I remember stopping my bike at some random spot on the trail. I killed the engine and took off my goggles and helmet. I walked my dirt bike off the trail to the left about 100 yards into some kind of thicket (juniper? sage?). I set my bike on the kickstand and sat down in the center area of this small group of shrubs. I took my moleskin and my pistol out of my riding back. I had one round in the magaize- it was a 125gr jacketed hollow point 9mm. I pushed the clip in, chambered the round, and set the pistol down next to me.

It was a beautiful day. Hot, but beautiful. A nice breeze. No clouds. At that altitude (8000 ft), everything is always a little cooler, even when the blazing summer sun is directly overhead. I open my moleskin and started writing names. My sister. My grandmother. My brother. My boss. The two coworkers I was close with. A couple of other names I don't recall now. Maybe my husband's name? I sat and stared at the page, still crying, still tired, still done. I wanted to write a note for each person but realized it wouldn't matter in the end. I leaned back and laid down, staring up at the pine trees and the sky, tears still streaming out of my eyes. I blankly stared for what seemed like an hour. It was nice - I found myself meditative state where I had no thoughts popping up anymore, just calmly staring into nothing with no thoughts, no hurt, no sorrow, no happiness. I rarely can get to that point when I meditate, so it was an unexpected gift.

I must have dozed off and I startled awake. I don't know what it was - maybe a hypnagogic twitch, maybe a noise, I had no idea. But I was very awake. I remembered - I came here to close out the story of my life on my terms. My bike was cooled down by then and I laid it on its left side and moved it under the cover of the shrubs. My pistol was loaded, and I was ready to roll. I picked up the gun, checked the chamber - ready. I moved next to my bike under the overhang of some branches. With my right hand, I placed the muzzle behind my right ear, maybe an inch behind my ear canal. Midbrain and brain stem. Instant. No sense of pain. No real chance at screwing it up, especially with hollow points. No chance at being found in time for a rescue. It would be over faster than my brain would register. And with the placement, that pretty much ensured my brain would not have the functional capacity to register. Instant knockout, instantly end the respiratory drive. Heart would beat for a bit. My brain would die obviously from the bullet and my heart would die from blood loss and eventually a massive heart attack. I knew what I was doing and I was ready. My final gift to myself and to no one but me.

My finger in the trigger guard. Then my finger on the trigger. Slight pressure. And I sat. And sat. And sat... And I couldn't do it... I don't know why. No divine intervention. No ""I felt a presence."" Survival ""instinct"" maybe? Hoping that maybe, by finally walking right up the the line and taking such an extreme measure and backing down, things would finally change? Embarassment? Honestly, in retrospect, I was taken aback that it had all come to THIS. That I was there, planning on doing THAT. I was so ashamed. Scared and ashamed. I wanted anyone in that moment. Anyone to find me - to see what I was doing and to just hold my hand and tell me, ""No. Not today. Not like this. I am here and I'm going to help you."" Of course, by my own design, no one came and no one was there.

I set my bike back upright. I unchambered the round and put the pistol back in my pack. I ripped the page of names out of my moleskin. I folded it twice and set the page on the ground by the shrubs. I found a rock large enough to cover the entire folded page. Maybe some kind of grim ""message in a bottle."" I gathered the rest of my things and put my helmet on. I started my bike and set off.

I made it home about an hour later and husband met me out on the driveway. I had been gone for almost four hours. I knew I was in trouble and I was expecting his normal reaction - anger and hostility. I turned off the engine, lowered the kickstand, and swung myself off the bike. With this odd look of concern (I remember it so vididly - concern is not on the approved emotion list for him), husband said, ""Where were you."" I lied, ""I got turned around on the mountain and had to double back a few times."" He followed, ""You left your phone and watch. I was worried. I'm glad you made it back ok."" I paused and said, ""Me too."" I still don't know if I meant it or not when I realized what came out of my mouth. And that was it.

Fast foward to now. I wish things were different. I wish I was different. It was helpful to share what happened that day. Something I can never tell anyone in my ""real life."" Thank you, American health care system, for making people who own firearms and work in the same health care system afraid to tell their story and be heard due to the fear of losing your freedom and livelihood. Since that day, a lot has changed and more has stayed the same. I continue to look for any excuse, any reason to keep on trying, to keep on going, to not give up. But three and a half years on, I find myself in the same position again and I'm quickly running out of excuses. Maybe I'll share more. I don't want to die, but I can't live like this anymore. I don't want to die, and it helps to share.","Nov 20, 2023 at 11:35 PM",,2247423,"Thankfully, The Time Has FINALLY Come...",,,,,,,,1104,1,2024-10-05T07:16:45.558415Z,1098,64.899,"{""choices"":[""done, started or prepared to do anything to end your life?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T07:16:45.558415Z,3

He's been gone from us for several years now unfortunately. But I was pleasantly surprised to see it is you. I rarely post but I want to apologize for not responding to you before. I must've been watching this thread because I was impressed with your writing and your grasp and depth of understanding of your own situation.

A Tortured Entity,"Hi, I'm recently turned 18 a month ago, from Europe. I'm just venting because I can't shake off any of these persistent thoughts of worthlessness.

Some backstory; I've been depressed since I was 14/15 and its only got worse with time. Started antidepressants and therapy at 16 and nothing has changed nor helped. I've stopped taking antidepressants by my own decision because I didn't notice a change and I hated the idea of having some sort of pill alter the way your brain works. Self harm here and there but nothing besides light scarring on arm that barely breaks epidermis, which constantly makes me feel shit and an insult to those that have done significant harm to themselves. Used to have passive suicidal ideations but they have worsened a lot to constantly provoking me daily and thinking about the gorey outcome of it all.

I don't really know where to start but I guess with stuff making me depressed and suicidal. I hate how I look and it has always destroyed any confidence I have in myself. I am not as unfortunate as others in the genetic lottery but I don't feel comfortable at all in my body. Any time I see a reflection of myself it always fuels me with anger because of how much I hate myself and that I'll never find a partner in life. And before anyone says that someone will like you for personality, that doesn't mean anything I look ugly. Also my well below average sheathed sword only makes me feel even worse about ever finding a girlfriend, so that helps a lot. I don't think I'll ever experience love so that's something I need to accept sooner or later.

I failed pretty much all my end of year school exams a month ago, so I have no hope of going to college without wasting a year of my life preparing again for the same stressful exams that is also a large part to blame in my deteriorating mental health. I had some hope in the weeks before exams by studying here and there but it was all just delusion because it is impossible to study a year and a half worth of material in less than a month. I missed probably a year and a half of school since starting therapy and antidepressants just because I was feeling so horribly low everyday. Exams roll around and first one goes horrible and I run out of time because of my non-existent time management and all hope is lost. I end up not sitting half of the exams and any exams I did sit I only ended up feeling even worse about because of how stupid I was for thinking I ever had a chance of getting into college. College is guaranteed out of the picture for me now and I am 100% certain I would not of even done well enough to meet the criteria of any courses I applied for (I applied for music production courses if anyone wanted to know). There is no possible surprise of getting accepted into a college because I know how poorly I did and I didn't even sit half of my exams out of pure anxiety and a horrible depressive episode. 6 years of school to just fall flat on my face and look like a dummy.

I have a very big interest in music and have wanted to make music since I was 14 and I haven't even made anything finished or completed since. Any time I did try to compose something, I would feel completely horrible about it and doubt my abilities to do anything just mere minutes afterwards. I would learn and learn but any time I tried to put my knowledge to use, it would just turn on me and make me feel worse. I have an issue of trying to perfect everything so I guess that is to blame, but I don't understand why I can't make something I don't hate. Regardless if its just the beginning of an musical idea I'm putting down, I just get this overwhelming feeling that I can't do anything good and that I'm horrible at music and I'll never get good at it and it traumatised me enough that I don't ever go near making music ever unless I get a random spark of motivation and decide to mess around spontaeneously with music, which always ends the same. How can something I love so much just not let me do it anymore? It's same with other things in life, like playing the piano, I get so angry at myself for making mistakes even though I only started piano half a year ago, I can't do anything about this perfectionist mindset and it's ruining everything. I love music so much and I always listen to it and love exploring new genres and going back and relistening to tracks that give me goosebumps from emotions intertwined with the music, but I can't start anything. There's also a problem with jealousy that lies there because when I do sometimes listen to music or see others drawings or art, I become envious of artists and their ability to make something so great because I can't do anything, but it doesn't make me go and hate the artist, it's just mental gymnastics I guess.

I don't do anything with my life either. I just sit in my room all day, barely eating and using my computer or sleeping as a form of escapism. I don't live in a nice area so there's nowhere quiet to be in nature which sucks, just constant vehicle noise and the sight of grey and bricks everywhere, quite awfully depressing the lack of green anywhere. I'm not mentally capable of a job either and I don't want to work for 45 years just for a pension. That's so fucking depressing to think about it just ruined my mood while writing this. I want to be able to do whatever and not be a slave for the rest of my life just to barely survive from paycheck to paycheck.By no time the whole world population will be depressed and given pills to survive. By no time the whole world population will be depressed and given pills to survive. I hate how the world has become.

I'd love to be able to appreciate the little things in life and take in nature but I can't where I live while also being in this depressive headspace, and being lazy/depressed to go anywhere doesn't help. I know for a fact I have an okay life, besides the mental health difficulties, that some people would call me ungrateful for not being happy and thankful for what I have, but in reality I can't see things the same way other people do while plagued with depression.

That's kinda it I guess, I don't remember if I'm missing anything, I just feel so utterly worthless everyday and I don't know what to live for anymore. I feel like my life is over.","Jul 16, 2024 at 10:13 PM",,2598969,Constant feeling of worthlessness,,,,,,,,1107,1,2024-10-05T07:18:13.179113Z,1101,50.632,"{""choices"":[""1 wish to be death?"",""low risk""]}",2024-10-05T07:18:13.179113Z,1

ReadyToGo34,"A few days ago, I didn't think I wanted to tell anybody of my plans. But against my better judgement, I did. My mom goes live on social media a lot now because she has serious health complications and has sought it out as a way of making friends. And she has. She typically goes on very early mornings, and I used to work nights (recently unemployed) so I would hop on at times when I couldn't sleep. I saw she was live a few days ago, maybe a week, not sure, all my days are a blur now, but I commented with my usual ""hey mommy!"". One thing I wanna say before I continue is, she doesn't deserve the attention I give her. I suspect she is a narcissist and from the age of 1 I was raised by my grandparents. She abandoned me, and did her ""best"" to be in my life a few years later and beyond, but she's just...not a mom. I've viewed her as like the cool bigger sister for a long time. She's not fit. But I digress. I say my usual greeting, everybody else says hi, and I stay for awhile to chat. Meanwhile, I contact her via a different app to impulsively tell her hey look, I want to DIE. Like...I can't go on anymore. I hurt, momma. Told her how I had a plan. She didn't see the notification at first, since she is busy on live. I write in the chat, hey check your other app, I wrote you something. She did and wrote back I'll call you when I'm done. I'm like...okay...so she'll just wrap it up and be done. Nope. She just stayed on live. Like..laughing and talking and livin it up. This goes on for over another hour. I hit her up again like ????? I'm in crisis, I need you, and her response was to tell me what a ""huge dump"" that was on her. I......I understand it's heavy news, but get off with your little friends and talk to me. I need my mother. Argument insues, where she is STILL on live, messaging me from the other app at the same time, and I finally said when I kill myself consider yourself responsible. She got mad that I would say that but I was done. In the mass letter I am asking my ex (pathetic I know, but I have nobody else to distribute this) to pass on to everybody, I have requested that my mother not have access to my funeral or knowing where I am laid to rest because she doesn't deserve it. And I mention in it, exposing her to everybody, that she couldn't be bothered to get off of live when I told her. I hope she feels like absolute dog shit over this. All this to say, I hope I am in the right. As an almost 50 year old woman with complicated mental illnesses herself, you'd think she would handle this better. Just ranting, I know it's incredibly long but if you read it all, thank you. I was already pretty determined, having suffered for years, losing the love of my life and losing my employment, but this was my last straw.","Jul 16, 2024 at 9:49 PM",,2598949,The last straw,,,,,,,,1109,1,2024-10-05T07:20:30.529616Z,1103,119.144,"{""choices"":[""1 wish to be death?"",""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thoughts and some intention of acting on them?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T07:20:30.529616Z,3

I did see that the calculated dose would be a 85:69 ratio with the lethal SN dose, though I would be interested to see if the mechanism of action due to the nitrite ion is the same & how symptoms compare between the two.

ferrie,"Bumping with more info

Potassium nitrite is a strong oxidizer with the chemical formula KNO2. High levels of potassium nitrite in the blood causes methemoglobinemia & its associated symptoms, headache, fatigue, dizziness, blue coloration to the skin & lips, due to the binding of the nitrite ion to blood cells, reducing their ability to carry oxygen. Sufficiently high levels can cause respiratory depression, collapse, and death. Potassium nitrite shares a method of action with sodium nitrite, but it takes more of the product to achieve the same effect. Its molar mass is approximately 85 g/mol. The molar mass of SN is approximately 69 g/mol. This is where the 85:69 dosing ratio comes from. However, LD 50 of potassium nitrite is cited at 235 mg/kg. Potassium nitrite is very soluble in water. At 0°C it's soluble at 281 g/100 mL, at 25°C at 312 g/100mL, and at 100°C at 413 g/100 mL. This is more soluble than sodium nitrite who at 25°C is 84.8 g/100 mL soluble. So while more potassium nitrite is required, less water is needed to dissolve it. It is also soluble in alcohol. Potassium nitrite is on the hazardous substance list because while not combustible itself, it may enhance combustion of other substances. It is non-flammable but explodes at 537°C. Overall, it is less ideal than its counterpart sodium nitrite, but in some locations it may be easier to source. I personally am still able to find it through a major online retailer. Less water is needed, which is nice. However, it would require more product, and your body rejects them mixture due to the amount of salt required. An equivalent dose of potassium nitrite to 25 g of SN would be about 31g. An extra 6g of salt may seem insignificant, but I feel it would probably increase the chances of vomiting even with an AE. I have access to online medical journals & make look into more research about it. It seems like an alternative for SN that would have more issues with keeping it down, but I figured the math on it might be interesting","Jun 1, 2024 at 1:17 PM",,2544529,Potassium nitrite procedure,,,,,,,,1143,1,2024-10-05T07:22:13.287306Z,1136,5.197,method,2024-10-05T07:22:13.287306Z,5

Could I ask what you know of methylene blue? I know it's full of very good health benefits. However it seems if dosed higher it has the opposite effects. Since it's a treatment for sn poisoning, it helps the blood bind oxygen again… but from what I've read, if dosed higher wouldn't that stop our blood binding oxygen, just as sn/kn would?

Honestly personally I don't feel like any of us are really to blame necessarily for the circumstances we ended up in. Life is just a clusterfuck of random chances and an unpredictable genetic lottery + random family placement on Earth.

The fact that you try is beautiful in itself and I don't see anyone as ugly but I can certainly relate to feeling that way.

I think everyone here is stronger than people who have never gone through these levels of suffering will ever know. Not to say that makes any of the shitty things worth it just that you're probably the farthest from weak of many out there.

The only time I have seen people directly talking someone out of their attempt is:
-when is will harm or traumatize others
-when the method will more than likely not succeed

Which I think are fair reasons. Nobody is telling these people not to CTB, just alter the method.

I have been waiting for ages for sodium Thiopentone to be delivered and it still has not come it was my plan. Today I really need to go and i was thinking about inhaling chlorine gas in a mask, I have a mask with a chamber for my asthma inhaler I was hoping to use that.

I once did that by accident mixing vinegar I put in toilet and bleach, as I forgot there was something in there and it did make me sick for a few days.
I can read online 1000ppm concentrations can kill within minutes.

Is there a chance inhaling it through this mask system from a bottle or something will reach at least 1000ppm and kill me?

sorararara,"Hi I'm sorry if this isn't even fucking readable. It feels like my mind is being flooded and I just need to throw my thoughts out there. I would dm a friend but I'm tired of being a fucking bother. I know my friends are getting sick of me constantly being on the verge of killing myself.

Everything is getting worse. Things get better for a couple days but then come crashing down.

I feel so alone, I want to stop feeling alone. I vented about this in my last post, about how I'm alone but can't bring myself to text anyone back. I can't function, I want to be loved. I mean I am loved, my friends love me and most of my family loves me, but it's just never enough. Something always feels off. I feel so guilty. I'll never make anyone feel like they're not doing enough because I know that it's just my brain being stupid.

I just want to be in a relationship, I don't know. I want to be someone's favorite person. I've never been in an actual relationship, but it's all I think about these days. All of the people around me are getting into relationships or are actively trying to find partners, I'm so frustrated.
I could suck it up and get myself out there, try to find a relationship. I've considered it, but no. There are two big reasons why I can't be in a relationship:

1.) Who the fuck would even want to be in a relationship with me? Who would want to spend the rest of their life with a short, ugly trans guy who never shuts up about how miserable he is and needs constant fucking validation? I'm fucking annoying. Whenever I'm not yapping about how suicidal I am, I'm going on and on about some random interest that no one fucking cares about.

2.) I'm just not stable enough. I don't think I need to elaborate on this point, lol. I refuse to put someone through this, I don't want to drain anyone else because of my issues.

I'm so tired of being miserable and hating myself. I've been starving myself because it's the only chance I have at looking masculine. I'm already a little underweight, but I still look like a woman. I need to lose all my body fat but I'm so exhausted and hungry and tired and i'm in so much pain lolololololol I don't even know if there's a point to it, I'll never fucking pass as a man and the majority of the population will just label me as a confused girl or an attention seeker or some shit, there's no point.","Jul 16, 2024 at 8:16 PM",,2598890,Disorganized vent,,,,,,,,1184,1,2024-10-05T07:29:54.131065Z,1177,25.27,"{""choices"":[""1 wish to be death?"",""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""low risk""]}",2024-10-05T07:29:54.131065Z,1
Alessa,"Hey there,

despite taking an antiemetic, it will be (highly) possible, that I will vomit when I will have my attempt. It wont happen directly after, maybe half an hour later, but I need to prepare for that case. Iam pretty sure, that it will happen when Iam unconscious, so I want to make sure that I will suffocate from my own vomit while Iam unconscious.

Therefore it's important to keep my body in a specific position. Definetely not lying on the side, but on my back, head a bit lifted, maybe a comfy pillow. But I also want to make sure, that my head stays in its position, not turning to the side. I already chose a nice place where Iam going to do it, but there are no ""devices"" where I could attach something. Its a place in nature, gras, trees, bushes around me. I wanted it to be a really peaceful setting with a nice calming sight.

So... how likely is it, that my body moves while Iam unconscious? Might be a stupid question, maybe unconscious really means no movement at all, but Iam not an expert. Its high likely that I will pass out after 3 to 10 minutes max, so I only need to prepare for the shit that could happen after I got unconscious.

I would apprciate your feed back.

I was at a loss so I reached out to my psychologist. I haven't seem him in months because of work. I asked if he was free and he said no. No follow up. No offering of other sessions. I was going to ask him what to do. I don't think he wants me as a patient. My background probably turned him off.
I still have a potential, serious legal issue. It's been 17 days and nothing. But no doubt that it can pop up on me at any moment, at any time.

I thought long and hard about it all. The reality is that it's not fair to me to stick around and sacrifice when I was trying to kill myself just a few days ago. I thought of the worst case situation which would be for me to go back to prison. I did 2 years and was released in 2018. I was one class short of my master's! I know if I get arrested, then I am going to do serious time. No one knows what's going to happen. It makes me wish I had died years ago. A part of me says wait it out but the ""adult"" side says to ""check out.""","Jul 16, 2024 at 5:51 PM",,2598800,Oh the irony of finally getting a method of death,,,,,,,,1197,1,2024-10-05T07:34:27.357754Z,1190,26.272,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""done, started or prepared to do anything to end your life?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T07:34:27.357754Z,3

grimfox,"I am depressed and socially anxious since I was 9. Relentless bullying, mental and physical abuse really took a number on me, sounds pathetic, I know. Getting beaten up by my peers or shouted at by them or pushed by my teachers for not answering fearing I would say something idiotic were every day things back then. My language teacher snapped my pen in half because I was afraid to answer her question in front of the whole class in grade 5 or 6. I spent my schooldays sitting at the back of class thinking and daydreaming about a better situation yet people singled me out for shits and giggles I guess. When they didn't make fun of me as a person they targeted my obvious mental Health issues. I get it, I used to put a massive target on my back for people to exploit and laugh at - which is, and was my fault whether I like it or not - it's like these people felt like it's their duty to fuck my days up even more for God knows why. And this is all I remember from that part of my life. I know a lot more has happened but I just can't remember. All I feel is pain when I try to sum these barely existing memories up.
I Never had anyone in my life who I could talk to about my feelings our thoughts in general, ever. My mother dismissed my feelings most of the time or simply told me to bottle them up since nothing can help me anyway. My personal favorite line of hers was ""I've been through a hell of a lot worse than you, kid."" Which is kinda true. She had it worse than me when she was young. My semen donor left me and my mom before I turned 1. He chose the alcohol over us. I guess he knew (or guessed, I dunno) that I was a lost cause the moment I was born so he left a bit later. I contacted him here and there, I don't even know why. I knew all along I'm probably bothering him - or he simply doesn't care - by reaching out and I stopped after a while. It's been a few years since we talked when I realized a phone works both ways but he never bothered to text me or give me a call. He promised he would but I guess he forgot or simply didn't care.
And this sums up a few things that still haunt and bother me to this day. I hate it so fucking much here. I've been planning to end it all but I don't have the balls to actually do it yet, and I honestly don't know why. There's nothing for me to live for, I'm just existing without a cause rotting in bed when I can or daydreaming when I have to go out for a reason or another.

Why do you and these so-called people who care only come out of the woodwork when i vent abt wanting to kill myself?

MorningDove,"I spent all my childhood in my own mind, playing video games, playing pretend, anxious about OCD thoughts and that manifested in panic attacks and sometimes aggression. In highschool I had friends all of a sudden. In college I was depressed because I truly had no idea what to do. I was gripped by a terror.

The terror went away around when I met my boyfriend. For 4 years I deluded myself into believing I could go into this niche career with so much socialization required. But for at least 3 years, I felt so free of the terror. I could live and play pretend house, dreaming of a future that would never come. Would we own a dog when we married? What would we do when we took a trip to Japan?

And now its becoming clearer that this career is not a good fit for me. Maybe no career is a good fit for me. And my boyfriend is anxious as I have been on voluntary hold already. He wants a house and maybe some healthy children that I can't give to him due to my genes. He hasn't broken up with me yet, but we have planned on moving soon.

And I kind of want to end it here, in this apartment while he's out at work and I can set up a sign to call the police, instead of subjecting my parents to the horror of it all somewhere down the line.

BirdWithoutWings,"This is just a personal vent about my life, apologies if that isn't allowed. I don't have anybody in my life, so I'm just here to scream into the void until I'm finally ready.

I've grown up always knowing that I wasn't going to make it too far. Classic sob story, born to an abusive single mother then placed with my grandmother where one of her sons proceeded to sexually abuse me until I sent him to jail (which resulted in me being exiled from the family. My CFS cheques were used so he could eat lavishly in prison+have a TV and other fun amenities in his cell while we had no food or water.) My first attempt that resulted in requiring hospitalization happened when I was 13. Tylenol overdose, obviously not successful. I just had consistent bad luck growing up. Around the age of 18 things temporarily looked up for me. I went from failing every class k-11, to being able to grind out all my credits within a year and a half. Sadly, I couldn't graduate with my class as a single credit wasn't ""processed"" properly resulting in me not qualifying to do anything with my class. That was a pretty major hit as I was the first person who was going to be graduating from my biological family, with decent grades on top of that, and yet, I couldn't walk or attend any of the festivities. All good.

I got accepted in university against all odds. I inherited money due to my mothers suicide and biological grandmother and great grandmother passing, so I proceeded to use that in the hopes of bettering my life. I moved out from my grandmothers home where I was consistently treated poorly, belittled, and having my belongings stolen and destroyed (the uncle who abused me had a daughter with a random white trash whore in the hopes of being able to skip prison time. The entire family tried to guilt me into not testifying due to her being born. When he was sent to prison, her white trash mother wanted to party all the time so that child was ALWAYS home with us.) I got a partner. I finally had motivation for some sort of future. I tried to study social work in the hopes of using my life experience to help others, but I was told by a professor I should drop out due to not being proficient enough in the language (french). So i did just that. I then attempted fine arts, as all I wanted was to accomplish something besides the absolute bare minimum. I did well in my studies, won scholarships and bursaries from my portfolio, I got a government position. I was delusional enough to think that things would actually work out for me, that was my first mistake. I lost funding for school due to my funding being reassessed (and never actually.. reassessed..) I also had to deal with my uncle coming out of prison. On top of all of this, I was stressing over a relationship it turned out the other party was never even interested in. The only thing that was keeping me going through all the other stressors in my life was the fact that I had somebody in my life I could share everything with and they loved me no matter what. It turned out I was mistaken. I spent hundreds in gifts for this man for every holiday, he couldn't remember my birthday and wouldn't get me anything for any other holiday. One year he lied to me and told me my birthday gift was in the mail, it never came. It turned out he never ordered it and lied due to ""not knowing what to do."" After half a decade of sleeping with this man exclusively, and 3 years of dating (in which he never ONCE allowed me to meet his family, or anybody in his life. His family assumed he was gay and sneaking out to see a man when he was coming out to see me once a week.) Oh yeah, he would only come and see me once a week. Usually long enough to get what he wanted from me, then he was out. Never once went out on a date. He asked me out, telling me he was going to teach me about relationships.. Yeah right..
We would only communicate via Discord as he always had excuses as to why he couldn't come see me (unless convenient for him), eventually he stopped putting effort into responding to my messages. If I wouldn't start the conversation, he would go week(s) without contacting me. Yet he would accuse me of cheating on him. While he was going to other women's places and hanging out with them. I eventually cut off the relationship as I was losing my mind over how one sided it was, and he proceeded to lie to me for MONTHS about how our relationship went, before admitting that he was never ""invested"" but he definitely wasn't doing it just to sleep with me. We proceeded to be FWB for a solid year after that, as I had nobody else in my life. My family, no friends, no nothing. Nothing changed obviously, but I for some reason thought maybe something would change.

I'm now 24 and I've got absolutely nothing going for me. I only make enough to cover my rent, no utilities, no groceries, nothing else. I don't have a completed postsecondary education, so I'm not even considered as an option for employment. I don't have looks, I don't have intellect, I don't have anything. I don't know what prompted me to even consider getting this far in life, as I always knew I was NEVER going to succeed in a relationship, in education, or in th e workforce. I was frankly just set up to fail, and I should have accepted it. I now have so much more BS I have to deal with than I did back then. I wish I had succeeded when I was 13.

The bright side is my ex's birthday is soon, and that's when my last cheque should be coming in which is less than what my rent is. I think I'll have enough fuel to be able to CTB on his birthday. My mindset is he ruined every single birthday that I had a chance of actually being able to celebrate, so he deserves to have one ruined. I haven't quite decided if I want to write out letters to people, or just make a few videos and have those scheduled to be posted+sent the day after. To be fair though, I'm not even sure who I'd leave message(s) to as I don't have anyone in my life who'd care enough about it. I'd likely just make a video stating that I can be used for science, my belongings given to a handful of people who were alright to me or donated somewhere, and if my body isn't viable to be used for anything, then they can just mass cremate me and throw me out.

Apologies for the long winded rant, I know it's incredibly self-centered. I hope anyone who see's this has a good day, and apologies again.","Jul 16, 2024 at 4:54 PM",,2598749,Life truly didn't get better.,,,,,,,,1266,1,2024-10-05T07:46:20.142285Z,1259,94.239,"{""choices"":[""1 wish to be death?"",""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thinking about how you might do this?"",""thoughts and some intention of acting on them?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T07:46:20.142285Z,3
BirdWithoutWings,"I'll just post little vent updates here as to not shit up the forum with multiple topics of my self pitying.

I didn't end up doing it on my ex's birthday. An old friend invited me to a concert on the 10th so I'll likely wait until then at least. Since my last post, my landlord threatened to evict me due to lack of cleanliness (my place was clean. LOL), my pc stopped working (nothing has worked so far to fix it, so yay?), due to the PC, I lost my work for a contract I have to get done by september. So overall, feeling like I'm getting curbstomped while I'm already down.

Latest rant

I have a singular family member that I'm close to, being a second uncle. He pitched that we go visit my mothers grave which is a 3h straight drive there. Additional context, my mother was adopted, my bio grandmother was, her siblings, her parents, etc. This grave has 3 of my biological family members buried in it, my mom, grandmother, and great uncle. I obviously said yes as it's been two years since I've been able to visit, and my grandma decides to join too. Cool! She then decides to invite the child of the uncle who I sent to prison (who is 7 maybe?) to join us on this SEVEN HOUR TOTAL TRIP not counting the time spent at the grave, then local landmarks. This child blasts youtube on her phone (which she has had since she was 3) and whines about when her mother is coming to get her every few minutes, in what fucking world would I or ANYBODY else want to deal with that?? Not only that, but she does not know nor is related to anyone buried there. This gravesite, this town, everything about this trip is specifically related to MY biological family. I ended up telling them I won't be going, and to have fun visiting MY biological families grave(s) with her, as that's exactly what they are doing.

Bright side is at least I have more fuel to CTB as if the family who raised me are going to be that inconsiderate of me, it's at least a pretty good indication that my departure wouldn't cause too many issues. I'll simply just be forgotten, as was my mother.

Another bright side is that my family has no pictures of me anymore (my photos were considered ""clutter"" so we had to get rid of them when my grandma moved haha.) and there's no photos of me from grade 7-12. So if I start nuking my selfies and social media, it will be a lot easier for me to be completely forgotten, as once I'm gone, there will be no current photos of me to remember me by. I was able to start shredding my finearts portfolio as I don't want to be remembered AT all not even my work. There is apparently a prof or two who uses my work in their ruberik as examples of A+'s, but thankfully those will likely eventually get replaced with even better works. And even if not, thankfully I know that nobody remembers me or my work so it'll essentially just be anonymous photos if I really think about it. There's a lot of things I need to start getting rid of. I always told myself I'd give my partner of my friends my belongings, but as I've got nobody, I think I'll just try to find local people in need and give them what I can. There's some things I might be able to sell, so I might sell those items and then see if there's a local charity I could donate the funds to, as they'd likely benefit more from them than I ever would.

I had an old friend that said she wanted to hang today, but she proceeded to push the time back 3 separate times today and then totally ghosted. So it's safe to assume that it ain't happening, as it's already nearly the evening. Oh well! Probably gonna head out and smoke a couple more times this evening, work on a little pokemon illustration I've got in progress, and then benzo out for the day. The one positive I've got at this time is that I have cigs, so I'll take that small win haha.

Hope you're doing well, and thank you again. I hope you have an incredible week, despite being on this forum.","Aug 4, 2024 at 6:44 PM",2619991,2620165,Life truly didn't get better.,,,,,,,,1269,1,2024-10-05T07:47:49.094461Z,1262,21.617,no enough information,2024-10-05T07:47:49.094461Z,5

CatLvr,"Oh, my pleasure!! I know us Boomers have a bad reputation for being unsympathetic to you kids' plight in life but I cannot even comprehend some of the things I have seen and heard y'all having to go through. I have worked with kids who were sharing a 2 bedroom apartment with 5 other friends (yes, 2 kids in each bedroom and 2 in the living room) and they ALL were working 2 jobs and going to school.

These kids were NOT party animals. In fact, they would all describe themselves much like you described yourself. Slightly nerdy, trying hard and completely worn out. My heart truly breaks for you guys. Life is SO much harder now than it was when l was coming up. I have no idea why some old folks can't see that.

A lot of them talked about just going to sleep and never waking up. That was as close as they ever got to admitting they were almost at the end of their rope and we would talk about it a lot between customers and doing all the shit corporate retail America expected.

Anyway, I didn't live a charmed life (single mom, no child support or help from dad, no helo from my fam or his, it was just me and the kids) but I was still able to make it with 2 jobs. I was wore out ALL the time BUT ... I didn't have to have roommates in order to make ends meet. I didn't have to have first and last month's rent, a security deposit and deposits for all the utilities in order to move into a nice apartment, in a good school district, where me and my kids were safe.

I never had to worry about anyone coming into my workplace and shooting the place up. I never had to worry about my kids getting killed at school. Hell, when I was in high school we had shotguns in racks on the back window of our pick-up trucks -- that we left unlocked -- so we could go quail or dove hunting after school.

I could go on but you get my point. Life now is VERY different and to be honest I am amazed at the resilience you guys have. You have every reason to feel the way you do. And any time I can lend an ear, or help any of y'all kiddos thru a rough patch I am honored to do so.","Aug 4, 2024 at 8:48 PM",2620165,2620260,Life truly didn't get better.,,,,,,,,1271,1,2024-10-05T07:48:53.805951Z,1264,60.027,supportive,2024-10-05T07:48:53.805951Z,5
BirdWithoutWings,"Psht, I grew up around a load of boomers and I've never neccesarily gotten that vibe from 'em thankfully haha. It's just a couple sour apples that's making the whole orchid look bad for others. That group of five sounds like such an exasperating situation for them to have been in, I hope their lives improved significantly since then as I personally would NOT be able to do all of that. I'll agree that the resilience nowadays is frankly impressive, though the origins of that obviously less desirable.

The single mother life is a tough one, I'm sorry that that man never stepped forward once to at least help out monentarily. I'll never understand people who procreate (even if by accident) and then proceed to abandon the child due to differences in the relationship. Once it's done, it's a commitment. Step up and pay, man. I'm so sorry you and your mother had to go through that. I hope it's something you never took to heart, as I know some people tend to struggle with that. It's seriously impressive that you were able to maintain dual employment to keep yourself out of the hole for so long. I did it for two years, and I think it removed a solid 10 years from my lifespan. It's also incredibly commendable that you went through all of that effort just to ensure that your children would have a better life. You seem to be a great person, and I hope that life treats you and your family well. It's sad to see such compassionate people on a forum like this while bad people get to live their days without remorse. I've noticed that a LOT of the individuals in this community seem to be intelligent and have levels of empathy that surpass the people I encounter in my day to day life. Though I suppose being hyperaware of the world would contribute to one gravitating towards this forum haha.


I'm going to add a little update for the day in this post as I don't want to double post since most forums have rules against that.

Day wasn't too bad, though I was indeed correct in assuming that my old friend would not be coming to hang out yesterday. Family worked things out and the kid won't be going to the trip tomorrow so I'm back in. I was going to charge my camera batteries so I could do some wildlife photography out there, but I've pretty much lost all motivation for photography as I have a backlog of wedding photos I still need to work on. (1.7k photos for free for a family member. I was lied to to get me to do the gig, and then they proceeded to not pay me while making me do triple the work+200$ out of pocket costs for me for SD card and an extra battery.) I don't have headphones so I can't doom listen to music on the trip, so I suppose I'll just suffer haha. My current plan for the ""future"" is to CTB once I get back to my lowest weight I got to, 84 (that was only in april/may lol.. I was forced to gain to avoid being sanctioned in an eating disorder unit.) I was somewhat attractive when I was that low, and I'd like to die pretty as I was hideous until 23-24 . If I die pretty, at least I can pretend in my mind that I'll be so forever. So far I'm at 116.5? from 136 within about 2 weeks so I'll take it.

Bright side for today, the Pokemon illustration is turning out somewhat cute so far.

I'll post some of the WIP's in my rants as I don't particularly care if it were to be connected to me. Clefable has been carrying my ass hard in Unite so I decided I had to draw her clutchin' up in her outfit i got a while back LOL. Drawing this on my phone with S pen because my pc still ain't working despite multiple attempts at replacing parts. Working on this has been great as I lose track of time, so I end up not needing to eat much if at all in a day. Great for getting back to my lowest weight, while at the same time preserving the minimal food I've got left. I might post some of my cooking abominations in this thread along with my rants as I REALLY try to fancy up severely expired products (and frankly they turn out pretty alright haha.) Next post I'll have to post my expired canned chicken i turned into star tendies and covered in panko and spices to attempt to salvage (was delicious).

Hope anyone who see's this has had a good start to their week so far.","Aug 5, 2024 at 3:55 PM",2620260,2621072,Life truly didn't get better.,,,,,,,,1272,1,2024-10-05T07:50:06.728559Z,1265,72.243,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thinking about how you might do this?"",""thoughts and some intention of acting on them?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T07:50:06.728559Z,3

BirdWithoutWings,"I guess vents are going to be daily because GODDAMN.

My landlord is still harassing me in regards to the cleanliness of my apartment. He emailed me 1 hour into my trip causing me to have a nonestop panic attack until i got home 7 hours later. His complaint? My cats litterbox, that i clean out twice a day and disinfect in my tub once a week (and then sanitizing the tub).
As a result I've decided I'll be filing a human rights complaint to them, ratting them out to the city (they owe hundreds in fines for not repairing massive holes in the foundation that rodents come into the building from.), and then the tenancy branch as I might as well get a refund of all of my rent from it. Thankfully 5 past tenants in the building are willing to go through with it along with me to ensure it's actually investigated as holy fuck. These people have accused me of flushing cat litter down ANOTHER TENANTS DRAIN and threatening to fine me THOUSANDS (they never even repaired it so it must not have been that bad, assholes.) Punching? a massive 5 foot by 5 foot hole in the wall (it was incomplete work from years ago from a contractor they didn't pay to finish the job. Resulting in a MASSIVE rodent infestation in my bedroom as the hole led DIRECTLY OUTSIDE., spawning rodents in my apartment like some sort of minecraft spawner? (prior point explaining why it was happening), and now apparently being so dirty that I apparently need near daily emails and visits to my place as if I'm not cleaning everything daily.

So out of spite, I'm definitely making sure to completely and utterly destroy my unit and this mans property (not harming the other tenants places haha) when I CTB. It was initially going to be a benzo+hanging+exit bag trio, but I want to ensure that I not only decrease the property value, but also traumatize the ever living fuck out of them. The day of, I'll probably buy a couple packs of cancer sticks and chainsmoke 'em all day in my unit Absolutely anything and everything I can think of I will do to ensure that these guys have the most horrific remainder of their existences.","Aug 6, 2024 at 9:06 PM",,2622452,Life truly didn't get better.,,,,,,,,1274,1,2024-10-05T07:51:13.693915Z,1267,55.485,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thoughts and some intention of acting on them?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T07:51:13.693915Z,3

BirdWithoutWings,"Sorry I'll respond to replies once I'm in a slightly better headspace. My ex randomly messaged me at midnight to tell me that he's been seeing a new girl for a year. He never brought me out on a date, he never brought me around his family, he never showed me off to his friends, ANYTHING for four years, yet somehow is capable for someone else so shortly after? LMAOOOOO I want to fucking hang myself so badly holy shit. He got with these girl mere MONTHS after breaking up. Yet continued talking to me the entire time and then pulls this shit. I genuinely just do not want to exist anymore haha. Why am I NEVER worthy for anyone???? not for my family, friends, partners, NOBODY. Why do I have to put in all the effort just to receive none back MY ENTIRE LIFE?

The only bright side I've got is I've got a fresh bottle of klonopin. Might record a mini manifesto then start working on fasting and shit so I can maybe CTB this weekend haha. I'm thankfully got absolutely nothing left going for me in life at this point. It is what it is! But hey, at least I won't be missed. As that's my biggest fear. I'll truly be gone from everybody's lives as was wanted and intended. Too bad I'm absolutely out of all of my vices and am in the negatives in my chequing. Can't even plan my suicide with a ciggy or two. The incredibly short term plan is to prostitute myself a few times to buy my vices and what I need, and then I'd be pretty much good to go in style.

BirdWithoutWings,"I think my CTB date will my late aug/early sept. I'm supposed to receive a payout from the gov that might amount to 70k around the fall/winter, but I frankly don't really have much to stick around for regardless. Even if I have money to temporarily be out of poverty haha. I've got nothing, and nobody. So I don't really think I need to wait for that payment date tbh (as I won't even be able to afford to stay in my apartment + cover utilities for the time leading up to it lol.)

My phone and internet services get cut off on the 15th due to lack of payment (due to them trying to take the money out every other day, resulting in over 300$ of overdraft fees. Yay! we love having a -80$ bank acc.) so I might choose sept 15th as I shouldn't get kicked out within 2 weeks of none payment, plus the stress of my landlord threatening to evict me might just help be the final push.","Aug 18, 2024 at 7:25 AM",,2636687,Life truly didn't get better.,,,,,,,,1279,1,2024-10-05T07:53:28.729772Z,1272,21.209,"{""choices"":[""2 thoughts about killing yourself?"",""thinking about how you might do this?"",""thoughts and some intention of acting on them?"",""high risk""]}",2024-10-05T07:53:28.729772Z,3
BirdWithoutWings,"I've started getting rid of my excess belongings and deep cleaning my apartment. My mindset is since my family doesn't like me, I might as well make the whole packing and getting rid of stuff easier for them. My grandma cut complete contact with me recently so I also need to make sure I remove the rings she got me before I CTB so she can get them resized for the other grandkid. My ex is going to pick up the skates he had gotten me, as well as an old portrait I had drawn some time this week. The hopes are that I'll be able to have my entire place ready and decluttered before the end of this week, I spent most of the day working on a singular shelf haha.

At least it's a WHOLE lot easier to pack now, and I've left some empty boxes aside that should fit the rest of my belongings. I haven't quite decided on a date yet, but I'm getting pretty close to just impulsively doing it one of these days haha. I keep thinking about whether or not to leave a note or video recordings for the people who knew me, but I'm starting to realize that it would be for nobody, as I don't have anybody in my life who'd care about my passing. I just wish that Medical Assistance in Dying had become available when it was supposed to so I could leave while still having my body be useful for science or transplants. It feels like a massive waste to die and end up being useless, but c'est la vie I suppose!

The bright side to everything is that at least my ex's text to me a few weeks back helped me lose a ton of weight. So I will be able to die skinny thankfully! I think I've only eaten 3 times? since the message haah. So who knows, maybe I'll be able to eating disorder myself to death before I even need to do it myself!

kinderbueno,"Why is it that whenever I make a serious attempt at suicide my survival instinct kicks in? I don't need it right now, I wish I could turn it off. It has stopped me from attempting in the past, for example when I was about to jump out of a window (not a great method ik) a couple years ago and my SI kicked in and I just backed away in fear even though I'd been planning it for so long. My first attempt at suicide involved me trying to slit my wrists open (again, very bad method but I didn't know much about effective methods back then so don't judge), and I just froze. The blade was literally on my wrists and this sounds dumb but I was LITERALLY unable to move my hand down. I was just sitting there shaking in fear with a blade to my wrist unable to move and after a few minutes I realised I couldn't do it so I backed out.

hoppybunny,"They're so fucking selfish. I was recently looking up what CTB (I think it means catch the bus but pls correct me if im wrong) and I saw a PBS article talking about why the creators of this site need to be ""held accountable "" and why this place needs to be shut down for ""killing people"".

Not once in the article does anyone even talk about how we can even help ppl and stop them from even wanting to commit suicide.

Instead all they want to do is make it harder for people to get an escape from this shitty life so they can get off on their self righteousness.

""Oh no the poor families suffering want the site taken down cause their relative killed themselves because of the site""

Like if you loved them as much as you say they probably wouldn't have killed themselves but yeah blame the site that offered them a way out instead of yourselves for.not being able to help them.

There are so many reasons people comit, discrimination, abuse, poverty, disability, health and social pressure being one of the main issues and we can fix most of these issues by just not being shitty people and helping one another but of course we're not going to do that. It's easier to blame the suicidal person or people who help them find relief.


It's always, exercise more, go to therapy, eat better, meet the right people because it's your fault you don't want to live in this hellhole where the earth is getting hotter everyday, ppl treat u like crap because of your skin colour (just look at how wngland behaved towards sake after losing the Europa cup) or because of how you dress or who you like, people can barely afford to eat healthy cause everything is so expensive, it's hard to find Time to work out when work drains your soul. Disabilities wouldn't be so much of an issue if we cared about being inclusive and helping each other but no some buildings don't even have something as basic as a wheelchair ramp or an automatic door or elevator because it's ""too expensive or too much of a hastle"" to be considerate for our fellow humans.

AI is being used to replace the already poorly paid art jobs, and in the US where I live there's no communities cause I either have to love in the city where a bottle of water cost 5 dollars or I get robbed from walking the wrong way and there's no nature and there's just fucking concrete and cigarettes everywhere or I live in the fucking suburbs where it's just single family houses as far as the eyes can see and the nearest library or hang out spot is fucking 20 minutes away by car.

I haven't seen my best friend in person for so long since graduating high school cause I hate driving and even if I do.drive I can't keep the car at her place cause my family needs it for work. And if we don't pick each other's house there's nothing to do cause everything cost money
